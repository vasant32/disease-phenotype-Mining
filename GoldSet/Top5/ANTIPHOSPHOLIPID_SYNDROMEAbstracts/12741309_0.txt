The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) may present with serious cardiovascular complications which should be recognised by the cardiologist. The authors report a series of 6 cases of APS diagnosed after thrombotic events and the finding of antiphospholipid antibodies. The APS was primary in 5 cases and associated with tuberculous lymphadenitis in 1 case. There was cardiac involvement in 5 patients with pericardial effusion in 3 cases, complicated by tamponade as the presenting sign of primary APS in the other 2, valvular disease in one case (moderate mitral stenosis with aortic valve disease) and pulmonary embolism in one case. Five patients developed recurrent deep vein thrombosis of the legs. One patient had a transient ischaemic cerebral attack.
