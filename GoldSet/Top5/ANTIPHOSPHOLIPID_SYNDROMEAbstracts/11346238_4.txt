The purpose of this study was to investigate the biochemical characteristics as well as the occurrence and specificity of antiphospholipid antibodies in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from a patient with both antiphospholipid antibodies syndrome (APS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Proteins, lipids, cells and autoantibodies were determined. Immunoglobulins were purified with affinity chromatography. Autoantibody identification was assessed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and with electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting and revelation with antihuman IgG-peroxidase conjugate. Antiphospholipid antibodies were found to be present in the BAL fluid as well as in the serum from a patient with APS. Specifically, antiphosphatidylserine and antiphosphatidic acid IgG antibodies in the BAL fluid and antiphosphatidylcholine and anticardiolipin IgG antibodies in the serum were detected at high levels. BAL fluid protein and the percentage of neutrophils were found to be increased. A quantitative as well as qualitative deficiency of surfactant phospholipids was also observed. Antibodies directed against surfactant phospholipids could cause surfactant abnormalities and an inflammatory reaction. These disorders may be one of the causes of the ARDS or a factor in the perpetuation of the inflammation.
