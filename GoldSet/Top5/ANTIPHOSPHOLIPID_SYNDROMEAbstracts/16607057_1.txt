A 36-year-old woman was admitted for recurring chest pain and hemoptysis. Blood pressure in the right and left arms was equal, and no murmurs or bruits were heard. Body temperature was normal on admission and remained within the normal range during the hospital stay. C-reactive protein was slightly elevated (2.3 mg/dL) and lupus anticoagulant was positive. Angiography showed no abnormality of the aorta or its branches, but the left pulmonary artery showed occlusion at the proximal portion. Computed tomography (CT) revealed segmental wall thickening of the thoracic aorta. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG PET) showed high uptake in the proximal portion of the left pulmonary artery and in the thoracic aorta with wall thickening on CT. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis associated with antiphospholipid syndrome was made and high-dose steroid therapy (prednisolone 30 mg/day) was started. Two months later, the C-reactive protein level had decreased from 2.3 mg/dL to 1.1 mg/dL, and both the focal wall thickening and (18)FDG uptake of the thoracic aorta were decreased. 18FDG PET was useful for evaluating the efficacy of the steroid therapy in addition to making a diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis associated with antiphospholipid syndrome.
