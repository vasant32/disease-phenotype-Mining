The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between ischemic cerebrovascular accidents (ICVAs), that is, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke, and left-sided heart valve abnormalities (LHVAs) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In total, 71 consecutive SLE patients were studied. At baseline, history, clinical and laboratory evaluations, as well as trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) were performed. From the original population, so patients were followed up for a mean time of 5.80 +/- 1.53 years. After a mean period of 5.39 +/- 1.42 years; 40 patients underwent a repeat TTE. Previous ICVA history was present at baseline in 16 patients (22.5%). Of these, 13 (81.2%) had evidence of LHVAs on TTE. Previous ICVAs were significantly associated to diagnosis of secondary anti-phospholipid syndrome (SAPS), positivity for anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aCl), and LHVAs. Multivariate analysis confirmed the correlation between previous ICVAs and LHVAs. LHVAs were not more commonly observed in patients with SAPS compared to patients without SAPS. At the end of follow-up, irrespective of any differences in antithrombotic treatment, ICVAs had occurred in 13 patients. During follow-up, ICVAs had recurred in seven patients, while a first event TIA occurred in one patient. Multivariate analysis confirmed the relationship between ICVAs and LHVAs, and a trend towards a positive correlation of the former with SAPS. This study demonstrates that LHVAs represent a compelling risk factor for the development of ICVAs in SLE patients. Conversely, SAPS and aCl positivity, although associated with ICVAs, did not clearly correlate with LHVAs in our study. These results provide insight on the pathogenesis of ICVAs and may give clues on the potential efficacy of preventive/therapeutic strategies in different SLE subpopulations.
