 BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of complement is unclear in patients with unexplained recurrent miscarriage, though low levels of complement 3 (C3) and/or complement 4 (C4) are reported to be associated with the antiphospholipid syndrome (aPS). We therefore investigated whether C3 and C4 have a predictive value for subsequent miscarriages. METHODS: In total, 215 patients with a history of two consecutive first-trimester miscarriages and no abnormal chromosomes in either partner, no uterine anomalies and no antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies were examined. Blood tests for C3, C4, total haemolytic complement (CH50), immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) were performed before subsequent pregnancy. Patients were then followed up without treatment, and their pregnancy outcomes were compared with their previous blood test results. RESULTS: From 215 pregnant patients, 45 subsequently miscarried, whereas the remainder had a live birth. There was no relation with serum CH50, IgG, IgA and IgM levels, but C3 and C4 levels in patients with subsequent miscarriage were significantly higher than in those whose pregnancy was successful. CONCLUSION: In patients with two previous miscarriages, C3 and C4 levels were higher in those women who had a third miscarriage, than in women that went on to have a live birth.
