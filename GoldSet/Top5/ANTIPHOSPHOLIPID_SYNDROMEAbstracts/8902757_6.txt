aPL-associated thrombosis (Hughes syndrome) is widely recognized as a major cause of organ damage in autoimmune diseases. Beginning with the first symposium in 1984, international aPL symposia have facilitated research on aPL antibodies, and the clinical standardization of aPL tests. It is hoped that the present symposium will continue this tradition, because much remains to be learnt about the origin and pathogenicity of aPL antibodies. In addition, new insights are needed for more effective therapies to be developed.
