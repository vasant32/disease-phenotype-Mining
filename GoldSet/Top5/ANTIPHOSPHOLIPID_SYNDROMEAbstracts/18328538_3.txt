It has been reported that IgG to oxidized LDL/beta2-glycoprotein I (oxLDL/beta2GPI) complexes are associated with arterial thromboembolism (TE) in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). How these antibodies behave in arterial as compared to venous TE in APS is unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of IgG anti-oxLDL/beta2GPI with clinical manifestations in category I APS patients. Fifty-seven APS patients with triple positivity (Lupus Anticoagulant (LAC), anti cardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (abeta2GPI) antibodies), 28 with arterial and 29 with venous thromboembolism, were included in the study. There were no differences in the dRVVT ratio, IgG/IgM aCL and IgG/IgM abeta2GPI titers in the two patient groups. There were no differences in the IgG (78.5 U+/-59.8 vs. 112.2 U+/-92.3) and IgM (16.3 U+/-15.9 vs. 21.1 U+/-14.3) anti-oxLDL/beta2GPI mean values. A significant correlation was found between IgG anti-oxLDL/beta2GPI and IgG anti-beta2GPI titers in the whole group of APS patients. Patients in the arterial group were older and had more risk factors for atherosclerosis. Data from this study do not support the hypothesis that IgG anti-oxLDL/beta2GPI are specifically associated to arterial TE in Category I APS patients.
