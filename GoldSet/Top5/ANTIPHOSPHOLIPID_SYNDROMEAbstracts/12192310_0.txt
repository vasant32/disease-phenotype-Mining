Venous thromboembolism is a multifactorial disease that is defined by multiple interactions between genetic and environmental components. Inherited thrombophilia may result in a hypercoagulable state that causes an increased tendency to thrombosis. We assessed the prevalence of factor V Leiden, factor II 20210A, antithrombin III, protein C and protein S deficiency, and the presence of antiphospholipid syndrome among 325 thrombosis patients from the East Bohemian region with a first episode of thrombosis under the age of 45 years. The average age of the first thrombotic event was 34 years (age range, 14-45 years). These data are not known yet from this part of the Czech Republic. Factor V Leiden was found in 40%, factor II 20210A in 6%, antithrombin III deficiency in 4%, protein C deficiency in 6%, and protein S deficiency in 11% in this cohort. Lupus anticoagulant was detected in 8% and anticardiolipin antibodies in 6%. Our results confirm the usefulness of thrombophilia work-up in patients with venous thrombosis before the age of 45 years in our region. The diagnosis of inherited thrombophilia is important for further management of these patients.
