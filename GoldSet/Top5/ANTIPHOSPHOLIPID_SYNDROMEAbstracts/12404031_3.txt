OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical significance of anti-NuMA and anti-HsEg5 antibodies in a group of patients affected with rheumatic diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2000 cells at serum dilution of 1:40 was used to examine 26 sera which had previously showed a "mitotic spindle" fluoroscopic pattern type during laboratory routine. RESULTS: 21 sera (80,7%) were identified with NuMA and 5 (19,3%) with HsEg5 patterns alone or associated with other ANA patterns. However only patients with isolated positivity and that is 15 with NuMA and 4 with HsEg5 stainings were included in this study. Of the NuMA positive patients 5 were affected with arthropathies associated to different forms of thyroiditis, 2 with seronegative arthritis, 2 with antiphospholipid syndrome, 1 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 1 with rheumatoid arthritis, 1 with sicca syndrome, 1 with undifferentiated connective tissue disease, 1 with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and 1 with retinal thrombosis. Of the HsEg5 positive patients 3 were affected with SLE and 1 with seronegative arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: NuMA does not prevail in any defined rheumatic disease, while HsEg5 staining were more frequent (75%) in patients affected with SLE all of whom showing high antibody titres.
