Almost a century after Buerger's original description of thromboangiitis obliterans, there is still no consensus about diagnostic criteria. The lack of a universally accepted method of diagnosis causes confusion, and mars research efforts. Some authors quote 'hematological disease' as one of the exclusion criteria. But in most recent reports, suspected Buerger patients did not undergo hematological tests to diagnose or rule out any primary or secondary hypercoagulable states. However, immunogenetic studies of Buerger's disease have led to a revived interest in the role of blood coagulation in the pathogenesis of thromboangiitis obliterans. Some association has been suggested between Buerger's disease and the antiphospholipid syndrome, as well as hyperhomocysteinemia. Other thrombophilic conditions have been described anecdotally in patients with Buerger's disease. In view of this developing line of investigation, there is a clear need to redefine the diagnostic algorithm and the criteria for diagnosing Buerger's disease.
