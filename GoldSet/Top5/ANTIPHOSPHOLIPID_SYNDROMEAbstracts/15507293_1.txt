With the currently available commercial kits, as well as homemade assays for detecting anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), it is not possible to discriminate nonpathogenic, beta 2 glycoprotein (GPI)-independent, infection-related antibodies from those of patients with the true autoimmune thrombotic syndrome, known as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). We devised an assay that is able to differentiate these two types of antibodies by determining the beta 2 GPI requirements to bind in a cardiolipin ELISA. Beta 2 GPI was purified by perchloric acid precipitation, and fixed amounts were used in the dilution solutions of the tested samples that were also tested with no source of beta 2 GPI. The ELISA plates were coated with cardiolipin, as usual, and blocked with a chicken ovalbumin solution. The serum samples had to be highly diluted in order not to have beta 2 GPI from the patient serum. The reaction was detected with alkaline phosphate tablets and developed with pNp in diethanolamine buffer. The adapted ELISA aCL assay described here was able to discriminate infectious [syphilis, hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue fever, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and leprosy] and autoimmune [primary APS and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) related APS]. Further testing should be performed to demonstrate that this method consistently differentiates pathogenic antibodies that bind in an aCL ELISA only in the presence of beta 2 GPI.
