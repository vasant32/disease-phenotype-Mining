Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) are two related autoimmune conditions. The pathogenesis of the diseases is unclear and the etiology is multifactorial. During the last 8 years our laboratory has been involved in induction of experimental SLE and APLS both by passive transfer of pathogenic antibodies (e.g., anticardiolipin) and by active immunization with pathogenic idiotypes. The naive mice, following immunization with Ab1, develop anti-autoantibody (Ab2) and eventually anti-autoantibody (Ab3) which has the binding capacities of anti-DNA or anticardiolipin. The mice with the characteristic syndromes were employed to analyze pathogenic mechanisms and new therapeutic modalities.
