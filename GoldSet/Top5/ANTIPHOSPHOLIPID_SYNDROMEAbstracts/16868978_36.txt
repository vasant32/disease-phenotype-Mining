 OBJECTIVE: Results of previous studies suggest that anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-beta2GPI) antibodies in complex with beta2GPI activate platelets in a dysregulated manner, potentially contributing to the prothrombotic tendency associated with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). We undertook this study to investigate the possible contribution of the GPIb-IX-V receptor to platelet activation mediated by the anti-beta2GPI antibody-beta2GPI complex. METHODS: In vitro methods were used in the present study. The interaction between beta2GPI and the GPIbalpha subunit of the GPIb-IX-V receptor was delineated using direct binding and competitive inhibition assays. The interaction between the anti-beta2GPI antibody-beta2GPI complex and platelets was studied using a novel method in which the Fc portion of the antibody was immobilized using protein A coated onto a microtiter plate. Platelet activation was assessed by two methods; one involved measuring thromboxane B2 production and the other involved assessment of the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/glycogen synthase kinase 3beta intracellular signaling pathway. The contribution of the GPIbalpha receptor to platelet activation induced by the anti-beta2GPI antibody-beta2GPI complex was assessed by observing the influence of 2 anti-GPIbalpha antibodies (AK2 and SZ2) directed against distinct epitopes. RESULTS: This study showed that beta(2)GPI could bind to the GPIbalpha receptor. The anti-beta2GPI antibody-beta2GPI complex was able to activate platelets, and this effect was inhibited by anti-GPIbalpha antibody directed against epitope Leu-36-Gln-59, but not by anti-GPIbalpha antibody directed against residues Tyr-276-Glu-282. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that inappropriate platelet activation by the anti-beta2GPI antibody-beta2GPI complex via the GPIbalpha receptor may contribute to the prothrombotic tendency associated with APS.
