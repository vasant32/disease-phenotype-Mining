OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the specificity of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) from patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) to various phospholipids (PLs), DNA, and beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta 2-GPI). METHODS: Five monoclonal aCL were established from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 3 patients with the APS. The reactivity of monoclonal aCL with various PLs, with DNA, and with beta 2-GPI was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: All of the monoclonal aCL bound to anionic PLs, only in the presence of beta 2-GPI. Neither monoclonal aCL nor beta 2-GPI bound to DNA. Monoclonal aCL bound to solid-phase beta 2-GPI on polystyrene ELISA plates that had carboxyl groups on their surface, but did not react with solid-phase beta 2-GPI on ordinary polystyrene plates. A mixture of beta 2-GPI and CL inhibited the binding of monoclonal aCL to beta 2-GPI, but CL or beta 2-GPI alone did not. CONCLUSION: Monoclonal aCL may recognize a cryptic epitope, which appears as a result of beta 2-GPI binding to anionic PLs or to polystyrene with carboxyl groups.
