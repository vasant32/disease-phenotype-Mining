Amendments to the Sapporo criteria for the diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) have recently be published and include testing for the presence of IgG and IgM beta2-glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI) antibodies. The Asserachrom Antiphospholipid antibodies line (Diagnostica Stago) with a monoclonal based standardisation, was evaluated in a Lupus anticoagulant (LAC) positive (n = 138) and a LAC negative (n = 134) populations. The ELISA line consists of the Asserachrom APA Screen, the Asserachrom APA IgG,M and the Asserachrom anti-beta(2)GPI IgG and IgM. Anti-prothrombin antibodies (APT), not being included in the updated laboratory criteria, have been tested by the Asserachrom anti-prothrombin IgG,M. Imprecision characteristics showed coefficients of variation (CV) ranging from 4.9% to 13.9%. Cut-off values were calculated with the 99 percentile. The Asserachrom APA Screen showed 1,5% false positive and 0,7% false negative results in correlation with the Asserachrom APA IgG,M. 14.7% of the patients were positive for beta2GPI antibodies, 30,0% of them showed a negative Asserachrom APA Screen. beta(2)GPI antibodies may be the only test positive in a minority of patients, so the Asserachrom APA Screen and the Asserachrom anti-beta(2)GPI IgG and IgM should be performed in parallel when APS is suspected. LAC and APA assays, however, remain essential in the laboratory diagnosis of APS.
