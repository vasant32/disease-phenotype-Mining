A symptomatic young woman with newly diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome with elevated anticardiolipin antibodies presented with small nodules on both leaflets of the mitral valve and with a consecutive high-grade mitral regurgitation, as diagnosed by echocardiography. In consideration of the preoperative and intraoperative findings, and the patient's low age, a mitral valve repair with removal of the leaflet vegetations and a ring annuloplasty were performed.
