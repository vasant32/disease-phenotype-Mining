Recurrent foetal loss is a significant clinical problem, occurring in 1-5% of reproductive females. Inherited or acquired thrombophilia has been diagnosed in 50-65% of women with history of unexplained foetal loss. The low molecular weight heparin was applied in 24 women with inherited thrombophilia and previous recurrent foetal loss and in 6 women with primary antiphospholipid syndrome throughout their following pregnancies. The dose of low molecular weight heparin for the majority of women was 35-75 u/kg. Women with primary antiphospholipid syndrome received both low molecular weight heparin and aspirin 50-100 mg daily. Implementation of thromboprophylaxis resulted in successful pregnancy outcome in 29 out of38 pregnancies, which represents a significant improvement of pregnancy outcome in comparison to previous 81 pregnancy losses. The number of treated pregnancies in our study is small, but the rate of successful pregnancy outcomes is high (76%), indicating that low molecular weight heparin may be a promising approach to women with thrombophilia and recurrent foetal loss.
