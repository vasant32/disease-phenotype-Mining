We enrolled and reviewed 26 medical records of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with intracranial hemorrhage (cases) and 104 randomly matched records of SLE without intracranial hemorrhage (controls) out of 6653 admitted patients at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1994 to 2012, to analyze the clinical characteristics and risk factors of intracranial hemorrhage in SLE. The incidence of SLE with intracranial hemorrhage was only 0.39% within the last 18 years at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. However, the in-hospital fatality rate was quite high (23.1%). Headache was the most common symptom (53.5%) in SLE patients with intracranial hemorrhage. The anatomical localization of the hemorrhages in the brain was predominantly located in the cerebrum. Intracranial hemorrhage could happen in either stable or active SLE patients. SLE patients with intracranial hemorrhage presented other neuropsychiatric syndromes defined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 1999, thrombocytopenia and antiphospholipid syndrome more frequently than controls. Thrombocytopenia was the independent risk factor for intracranial hemorrhage coexisting with SLE (OR = 3.687, 95% CI 1.510-9.001, p = 0.004).
