INTRODUCTION: Very little cases of antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) have been described among patients having chronic hepatitis C virus infection (HCV). CASE REPORT: We report the observation of a 43-year-old woman who presented APLS diagnosed following recurrent strokes. Etiological investigations concluded on an association of APLS with HCV infection. DISCUSSION: Besides being exceptional, this association raises certain etiopathogenic problems. Indeed while antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are frequently noted during chronic hepatitis C, they rarely generate thromboembolic complications.
