We describe a female previously diagnosed of primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome who presented a preclampsia in the second pregnancy. An urgent caesaria was made because of a worsening high blood pressure and oliguria. In the immediated puerperium she showed low platelets and persistent high blood pressure. Afterwards acute renal failure and neurological signs with a severe aortic valvulopathy were diagnosed. An haemolytic anemia was also detected. Definitive diagnosis was made by kidney biopsy with the result of a thrombotic microangiopathy. Treatment with low weight heparin and aspirin and systemic corticosteroids was started in the immediate puerperium and fresh frozen plasma was then added with a good response to treatment. Actually she is still with high blood pressure, aortic valvulopathy. Renal function is normal one year later.
