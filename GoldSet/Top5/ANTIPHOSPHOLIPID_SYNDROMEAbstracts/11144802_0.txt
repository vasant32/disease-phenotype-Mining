We describe a case of primary antiphospholipid syndrome presenting with varied arterial abnormalities. Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome commonly present with thrombotic problems, but there is a subgroup of patients who develop aneurysms with no evidence of vasculitis. This may represent part of the spectrum of the syndrome itself rather than an associated disease such as polyarteritis nodosa.
