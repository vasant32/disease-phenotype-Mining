Catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (CAPS) is a rare life-threatening variant of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS), with an associated mortality rate of > 50%. Treatment recommendations are aggressive and consist of intravenous heparin, steroids, immunoglobulins and/or therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). At present, insufficient data exist to make precise recommendations regarding the most effective therapy for CAPS. Accumulating evidence over recent years is encouraging and may lead to future guidelines. We report predictive and effective removal of pathological anticardiolipin antibody (aCL AB) in a patient with CAPS. The case report and discussion provide valuable insight into aCL AB production and its removal by first- order kinetics using TPE.
