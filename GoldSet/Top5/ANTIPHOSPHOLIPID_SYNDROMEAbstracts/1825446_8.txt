A 30-year-old man presented with an episode of deep vein thrombosis. He was found to have primary antiphospholipid syndrome with anticardiolipin antibodies and protein S deficiency. All other investigations were negative. Three months later, anticardiolipin antibodies were negative and protein S levels were normal. The transient presence of anticardiolipin antibodies and functional protein S deficiency in this patient suggests a new mechanism for the association between anticardiolipin antibodies and venous thrombosis.
