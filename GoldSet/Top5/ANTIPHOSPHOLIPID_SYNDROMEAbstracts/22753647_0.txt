 OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical manifestations of patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) and pulmonary hemorrhage (PH). METHODS: We performed a retrospective, single-center analysis of patients with APS who were followed up from 1980 to 2011. Of these patients, only those who fulfilled the Sydney criteria for APS were included. Patients with APS that manifested with PH were called the PHAPS group. The rest of the patients with APS served as controls. Clinical manifestations were compared between the PHAPS group and controls. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients fulfilled the criteria for APS. Thirteen experienced PH and were included in the PHAPS group. Seventy-five percent of the patients with PHAPS and 22% of the controls had mitral valve disease (p = 0.001). Central nervous system (CNS) involvement (cerebrovascular accident, seizures) was present in 61% and 16% of the patients with PHAPS and controls, respectively (p = 0.001). Skin involvement (livedo reticularis, chronic leg ulcers) was present in 54% and 8% of the patients with PHAPS and controls (p = 0.001). Pregnancy morbidity occurred in 87.5% and 32.5% of the patients with PHAPS and controls (p = 0.005). Ninety-two percent and 83% of the patients with PHAPS had high-titer immunoglobulin γ (IgG) anticardiolipin and β(2)-glycoprotein I IgG antibodies compared to 43% and 30% of the controls (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Patients with PHAPS were more likely than controls to have mitral valve disease, skin disease, CNS involvement, and pregnancy morbidity as well as high-titer APS. PHAPS seems to be a unique subgroup of all patients with APS.
