Hematological disorders (HD) have been estimated to implicate approximately 1% of patients with arterial ischemic stroke. However, previously published studies are mostly retrospective or based on case reports or small series in selected young patients. We herein prospectively included consecutive patients with MRI-confirmed cerebral arterial infarctions among individuals admitted in our stroke unit during a 32 month period to determine the clinical and neuroradiological features of ischemic stroke due to HD. Patients with both HD and other identified sources of stroke were excluded. Among patients who were admitted for suspected stroke, 590 had diffusion-weighted MRI confirmed acute arterial infarcts. Cause of the cerebral infarction was HD in 13 patients (2.2%): myeloproliferative disorders (n=4), multiple myeloma (1), lymphoma (1), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (1), disseminated intravascular coagulation (2), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (1), antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (2) and homozygous Q506 factor V mutation associated with lupus anticoagulant (1). The HD were previously known in 6 patients. The only significant difference between the groups of patients with or without HD was the prevalence of multiple acute infarcts in different vascular territories, detected in 53.8% of patients with HD versus 7.8% of patients without HD (mostly due to atherosclerosis, small vessel disease or cardioembolism) (p<0.0001; Fisher exact test). Initial treatment in stroke unit included anticoagulation, steroids, chemotherapy, phlebotomy or plasmatic exchanges, according to etiology. Rankin score at six months was â‰¤2 in 8 patients. A large spectrum of hematological diseases can be associated with cerebral infarction. In the etiologic work up, HD should be particularly looked for in patients with multifocal acute infarcts to adapt specific therapeutic management.
