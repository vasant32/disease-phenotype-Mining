Liver involvement in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is considered rare. Previous treatment with potentially hepatotoxic drugs or viral hepatitis have usually been implicated as the main causes of liver disease in SLE patients. On the other hand, even after careful exclusion of these aetiologies, the problem remains whether to classify the patient as having a primary liver disease with associated autoimmune clinical and laboratory features resembling SLE, such as autoimmune hepatitis, or as having liver disease as a manifestation of SLE. We report the case of an elderly woman who presented with acute hepatitis, who had been diagnosed with SLE 14 years ago and who also had Sj√∂gren's syndrome and anti-phospholipid's syndrome for several years. The histology depicted chronic active hepatitis and, after drug-induced hepatitis and viral hepatitis were excluded, the serological and clinical features were shown to be typical of liver damage caused by SLE. The patient was treated with azathioprine 100 mg/d and prednisone 30 mg/d. The clinical symptoms resolved in 10 days and the laboratory values were normal at the end of the first month of therapy. Prednisone was progressively reduced, during a period of 4 months, to 10 mg/d but azathioprine was kept to the same dose. One year after the diagnoses the patient is still in remission. Although uncommon, hepatic involvement is well recognised in SLE. The interest of this case lies in the differential diagnosis and recognition of this condition, which deserves an aggressive treatment.
