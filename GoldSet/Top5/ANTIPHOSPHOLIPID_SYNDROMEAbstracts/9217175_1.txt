The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is associated with production of autoantibodies with lupus anticoagulant (LA) activity. These antibodies cause prolongation of in vitro clotting tests by inhibition of the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin in the presence of anionic phospholipid (PL). The extent to which this inhibition reflects antibody binding to, or functional inhibition of, phospholipids alone, prothrombin alone, or a prothrombin-phospholipid complex is pertinent to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this syndrome. Immunoglobulin fractions (IgG) from 18 patients with LA activity were tested for inhibitory activity against prothrombin activation by either factor Xa, in a purified prothrombinase system, or by purified fractions of snake venoms (E. carinatus, E. multisquamatus) which cleave prothrombin at the same initial site as the prothrombinase complex but do not require anionic phospholipid as a cofactor. Parallel testing of the same IgG samples for prothrombin binding by immunoassay was performed. Although all IgG samples inhibited the prothrombinase reaction, only three exhibited any inhibition of venom protease prothrombin activation in either the presence or absence of PL. Only one sample exhibited prothrombin binding by Western blot. These results suggest that lupus anticoagulant antibodies are heterogenous and that many, if not most, of the autoantibody populations responsible for LA activity impair prothrombin activation by interaction either with phospholipid alone or with a restricted range of prothrombin-phospholipid epitopes expressed by prothrombin only as part of the intact prothrombin-prothrombinase complex.
