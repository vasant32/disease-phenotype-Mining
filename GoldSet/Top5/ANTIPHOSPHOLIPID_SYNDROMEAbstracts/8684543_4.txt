Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, specially those with antiphospholipid antibodies, have a high incidence of arterial and venous thrombotic manifestations. However, renal infarction has been rarely reported in these patients. The case of a young female with renal infarction, diagnosed by renal arteriography and scintigraphy, and arterial hypertension (AH) is described. In subsequent years she also suffered several cerebrovascular accidents with important neurological sequelae. No evidence of systemic disease was observed at this time. Fourteen years after the renal infarction a diagnosis of SLE was established. Despite therapy with prednisone, acetylsalicylic acid, azathioprine and antihypertensive drugs the progression of the neurological disease led to death. The sudden appearance of severe AH in a young woman with a renal infarction should alert the clinician about a possible underlying renal artery thrombosis in association with SLE and antiphospholipid antibodies.
