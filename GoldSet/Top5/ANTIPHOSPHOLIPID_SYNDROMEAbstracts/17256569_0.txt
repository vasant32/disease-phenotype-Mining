Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, also known as Hughes syndrome, is a hypercoagulable disorder that increases the risk of recurrent vascular thrombosis. We present a case of 26-year-old female who developed massive bilateral pulmonary emboli after being started on oral contraceptive pills. Further work-up of the patient revealed that she had anticardiolipin antibody syndrome and the thrombotic event was precipitated by oral contraceptive pills.
