Lupus anticoagulants, commonly found in the immunoglobulin fraction of patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and the normal plasma protein beta 2-glycoprotein 1 (beta 2GP1) may both contribute to the in vitro impairment of prothrombin activation associated with the APS. We examined the effects upon prothrombin activation supported by phospholipid vesicles of plasma IgG preparations from APS patients in the presence and absence of beta 2GP1. Using a purified system for measurement of prothrombin activation to thrombin, we demonstrated significant phospholipid concentration-dependent inhibition of prothrombin activation in the absence of beta 2GP1 by 11 consecutive patient IgG preparations. The degree of inhibition of prothrombin activation by equivalent concentrations of patient IgG correlated well with the extent of prolongation of the plasma clotting time in lupus anticoagulant assays of whole patient plasma. Additional studies with eight patient IgG preparations indicated that the addition of beta 2GP1 to patient IgG-phospholipid vesicle mixtures resulted in either independently additive inhibition by the two protein species (six cases) or potential inhibition of beta 2GP1 of the IgG inhibitory activity demonstrable in the absence of beta 2 GP1 (two cases). In addition, beta 2GP1-independent inhibition of prothrombin activation also occurred with three patient IgG preparations obtained by affinity binding to cardiolipin.
