This study investigated the use of well-defined bioconjugate molecules to suppress antigen-specific B cell responses to domain I (DI) of human beta(2)-glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI) in rats. DI is the dominant target of pathogenic autoimmune antibodies in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a disease characterized by antibody-mediated thromboembolic events. Rats primed with DI conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (DI-KLH) were rendered tolerant to subsequent antigen challenge by treatment with multivalent conjugates of DI. Antibodies to DI were suppressed 89-96% with intravenous doses of 500 micro g, and reductions were paralleled by decreases in splenic antigen-specific antibody-forming cells (AFC). Suppression was achieved with a variety of conjugates having two to four copies of DI and circulating half-lives of 2.6-8.7 h. Antibodies to KLH were not suppressed, indicating the specificity of the approach. These results establish the basis for further development of therapeutic B cell toleragens to suppress pathogenic antibodies in APS and other autoimmune diseases.
