We report on a 30-year-old female patient, with biological mitral valve prosthesis due to symptomatic mitral stenosis and a history of acute myocardial infarction and generalized tonic-clonic seizure episodes, visual hallucinations, cerebral thromboembolic events and, at present, chorea and acute carditis. The patient was diagnosed with active rheumatic fever (RF), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The combination of three unusual diagnoses in the same patient makes this a unique case, modifying patient treatment and prognosis.
