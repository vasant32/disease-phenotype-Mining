We report a 10-year follow-up on 52 patients with raised levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) who were first seen at our tertiary referral centre in 1986. The clinical and serological features of these 52 patients are described. Thirty-one patients had the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in 1986. Nine of these patients (29%) had further thrombotic events during the follow-up period. Of the other 21 aCL positive patients without clinical manifestations of APS, 11 (52%) developed the syndrome over this period. Five patients (10%) died during the follow-up. Close monitoring of patients with connective tissue diseases and aCL is essential as the likelihood of developing antiphospholipid syndrome is high.
