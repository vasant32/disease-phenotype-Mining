Antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) is a clinicolaboratory symptom complex characterized by development of venous and/or arterial thromboses, thrombocytopenia, obstetric pathology arising in the presence of hyperproduction of antiphospholipid antibodies (APAB). APLS may occur not only in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune diseases as secondary APLS, but in those without the above diseases as the primary APLS. The authors have examined 34 patients with APLS versus 10 patients with a verified SLE free of APLS manifestations. Affection of the valves was found in 30 patients with APLS (88%). More frequent were additional structures on mitral and aortic valve cusps, thickening of mitral valve cusps in APLS patients. Evident valvular disease was seen only in APLS patients with high positive levels of APAB. Valvular lesions were similar in patients with primary and secondary APLS. The study has revealed a relationship between the presence of antibodies to phospholipids and valvular abnormalities in APLS patients.
