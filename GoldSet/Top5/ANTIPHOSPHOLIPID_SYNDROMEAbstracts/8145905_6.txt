We present the clinical, hematologic, and radiographic findings in two brothers with Sneddon's syndrome (stroke and livedo reticularis) and antiphospholipid antibodies. Patient 1 had anticardiolipin antibody and patient 2 had lupus anticoagulant, which we detected only upon repeated blood testing. One should test for both anticardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant and repeat the screenings before determining a Sneddon's syndrome patient's antiphospholipid antibody status. Both Sneddon's syndrome and the primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome are potentially familial causes of stroke. In familial cases, an inherited predisposition to antiphospholipid antibody production may be involved in disease pathogenesis.
