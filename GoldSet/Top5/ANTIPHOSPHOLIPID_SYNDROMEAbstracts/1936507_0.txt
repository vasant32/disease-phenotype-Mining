We present a patient with primary antiphospholipid syndrome, as defined by nine pregnancy losses, the presence of lupus anticoagulant (LAC), and the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of autoimmunity. A successful pregnancy was achieved by treatment with low-dose prednisone (15 mg daily) and aspirin (100 mg daily). The patient was followed-up throughout her two last pregnancies and a 6 months postpartum period. Our data indicate that LAC serves as a marker of disease in women with previous pregnancy wastages, and that aspirin-prednisone therapy is beneficial in carefully selected patients.
