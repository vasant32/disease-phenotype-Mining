The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is defined broadly by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, venous and arterial thrombosis, thrombocytopenia and fetal wastage. APS can be primary or secondary, in which APS occurs in the context of another defined disease such as autoimmune disease, malignancy, drug-induced disease, etc. APS is primary in one-half of patients and secondary in the rest, mainly to systemic lupus erythematosus. Several cardiac manifestations of APS have been reported. These include valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, intracardiac thrombosis and cardiomyopathy. The literature has shown a prevalence of approximately 35% of valvular abnormalities detected by echocardiography in patients with APS. A patient with primary APS who developed aortic stenosis with vegetations on a bioprosthetic porcine valve is presented.
