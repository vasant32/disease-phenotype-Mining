The catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome is characterised by rapid onset thromboses, often resistant to conventional anticoagulant treatment, and resulting in life threatening multiple organ dysfunction. The diagnosis of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome may be difficult, predominantly due to its frequently atypical presentation. We report a case of a 35-year-old female who presented with a pancreatic tumour and extensive thromboses. Following a storm of ischemic events due to thrombotic occlusions in spite of therapeutic heparin dose, the suspicion of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome emerged. The patient was successfully treated with anticoagulants, immunoglobulins, plasmapheresis and rituximab. The present report shows that the use of the diluted Russell's viper venom time can be helpful in providing additional information on the lupus anticoagulants antibody status, allowing careful monitoring of lupus anticoagulants conversion and hence response to therapy.
