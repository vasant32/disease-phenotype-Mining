Quantification of lupus anticoagulant (LA) in clinical samples is hampered by the lack of a suitable standard of activity. We evaluated the use of mAbs displaying LA activity for this purpose. As most patient samples contain both beta2Glycoprotein I (beta2GP1) and prothrombin dependent LA, a combination of two mAbs, one of each specificity, was added to normal plasma in a concentration from 0 to 60 microg/ml. Eight assay systems using different reagents and instruments were used. The calibration curves were linear for all but one, with marked differences between the responsiveness to each mAb. A panel of plasmas from 69 patients with persistent LA diagnosed using the SSC-ISTH criteria was tested. An antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) was present in 40, whereas 29 were asymptomatic. LA activities of individual plasmas varied between assays (p < 10(-4)), but homogeneous subgroups were identified. In a majority of samples, LA activity displayed a prothrombin-dependent profile, with a variable contribution of beta2GP1-dependent activity. The latter was associated to beta2GP1 antibodies detected by solid-phase immunoassay. By using 3 dilute Russell viper venom time assays, higher LA titers were found in APS, compared to asymptomatic patients (p <0.05).
