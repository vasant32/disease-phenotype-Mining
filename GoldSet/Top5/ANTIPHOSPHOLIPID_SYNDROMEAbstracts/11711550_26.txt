The phospholipid-binding plasma protein beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2-GPI) is the primary antigen recognized by the circulating autoantibodies in patients with the "anti-phospholipid syndrome" (APS). Although heparin is routinely used in the treatment and prophylaxis of APS patients, the primary heparin-binding site within beta2-GPI has not been identified. More importantly, how heparin exerts its beneficial effects in vivo in APS patients has not been deduced at the molecular level. Using an expression/site-directed mutagenesis approach, we now show that the positively charged site that resides in the first domain of beta2-GPI is not the primary heparin-binding site. Rather it is the second positively charged site located within the fifth domain of the protein that also binds to phospholipids. Lys(284), Lys(286), and Lys(287) in this domain are essential for the interaction of beta2-GPI with heparin. These data indicate that beta2-GPI binds to heparin in a relatively specific manner even though the affinity for the interaction is rather low. Lys(317) resides in the center of the high affinity phospholipid-binding site. Surprisingly, heparin at concentrations that can be achieved in vivo during anticoagulation therapy greatly enhances the plasmin-mediated cleavage of the Lys(317)-Thr(318) site in beta2-GPI. Because the cleaved form cannot bind to phospholipids effectively, the combined actions of heparin and plasmin result in a diminished ability of beta2-GPI to recognize phospholipids. This, in turn, decreases the prothrombotic activity of the endogenous circulating anti-beta2-GPI antibodies in the patients. Thus, heparin exerts its beneficial effects in APS patients by at least two distinct mechanisms.
