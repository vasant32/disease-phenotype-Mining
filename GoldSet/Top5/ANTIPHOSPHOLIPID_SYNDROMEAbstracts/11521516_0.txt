AIM: To characterize clinical manifestations, course and laboratory signs of nephropathy in primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 6 patients with PAS and renal affection were observed for 10 years since 1991. They were examined for anticardiolipin antibodies and/or lupus anticoagulant. Renal tissue was studied morphologically in one patient. RESULTS: In all the patients renal damage manifested with arterial hypertension associated with isolated proteinuria. The majority of the patients had renal dysfunction. All of them had elevated level of antibodies to cardiolipin primarily in combination with lupus anticoagulant. Histological changes of renal tissue presented with thrombotic microangiopathy of glomerular and extraglomerular vessels, intimal proliferation and vascular wall thickening with occlusion of their lumen which combined with morphological indicators of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. CONCLUSION: The thrombotic process in the intrarenal vessels in PAS dictates the necessity to develop novel approaches to treatment of such patients. In addition to immunodepressants the treatment should include indirect anticoagulants and antiaggregants.
