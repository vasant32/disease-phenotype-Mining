The association of deep vein thrombosis with systemic necrotizing vasculitis is infrequent. Herein are referred two patients with microscopic polyarteritis and one patient with overlap syndrome who developed deep vein thrombosis which complicated in two cases with pulmonary embolism. The clinical features and the pathogenic mechanisms involved in this infrequent association are analyzed. In two patients the thrombosis was simultaneous with the diagnosis of vasculitis. In one patient deep vein thrombosis was the cause of hospital admission. Advanced age and thrombocytosis are factors associated to vasculitis, which may favor the development of thromboembolic disease. The presence of antiphospholipid syndrome was discarded. Although infrequent, this association should be considered because of the potential severe complications.
