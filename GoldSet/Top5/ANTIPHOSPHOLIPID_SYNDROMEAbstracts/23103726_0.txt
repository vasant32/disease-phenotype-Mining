Low molecular weight heparin is used in the treatment of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, who develop thrombosis while being managed on oral anticoagulants. Although laboratory monitoring of this agent is not widely performed, it has been suggested to be useful in selected situations of high-risk thrombosis and bleeding. It is however not entirely clear, whether the dose should be altered on the basis of anti-Xa results in asymptomatic individuals.
