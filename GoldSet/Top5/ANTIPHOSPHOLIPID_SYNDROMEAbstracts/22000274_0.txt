Antiphospholipid antibodies constitute a group of heterogeneous antibodies, which mainly recognize complexes made of proteins and anionic phospholipids. The nature of these complexes is currently better defined, as well as known, the structure of the antiphospholipid antibodies owing to the analysis of the monoclonal forms of these antibodies which were also studied both in terms of their precise specificities and cross-reactivity. However, the origin of these autoantibodies is not clearly understood, as well as the possible link between antiphospholipid antibodies present in healthy individuals, and those observed in autoimmune diseases. Only a fraction of antiphospholipid antibodies are pathogenic and directly responsible for the clinical manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome, but there is, to date, no biological test able to accurately detect pathogenic antiphospholipid antibodies. The diverse mechanisms which link these autoantibodies to the occurrence of symptoms, mainly during obstetrical complications, are better understood, and suggest new therapeutic avenues.
