Antibodies against β(2)-glycoprotein I (anti-β(2)GPI) are one of the hallmarks of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). However, they are heterogenic regarding their epitope specificity, pathogenic mechanisms and their avidity. In the current study we present some outstanding issues about avidity of anti-β(2)GPI antibodies. Our results confirmed that high avidity anti-β(2)GPI are associated with thrombosis and APS, while in low avidity anti-β(2)GPI group non-APS (predominantly systemic lupus erythematosus) patients prevailed.
