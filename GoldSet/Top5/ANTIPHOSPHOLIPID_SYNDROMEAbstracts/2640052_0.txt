A case of anti-phospholipids auto-antibodies syndrome is reported; it was an unusual expression of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The patient is a 38 years old woman, with a history of recurrent peripheral thrombosis, pulmonary and cerebral embolism, thrombocytopenia, abortions; moreover she suffered from arterial hypertension, and headache. Features of onset, with several episodes of relevant clinical severity and the long period without clinical and laboratory hallmarks of SLE suggest a serious caution in the diagnosis of "pure" anti-phospholipids auto-antibodies syndrome.
