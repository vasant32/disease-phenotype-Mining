Successful induction of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in two different non-autoimmune prone mouse strains, BALB/c and C57BL/6, was achieved by tetanus toxoid (TTd) hyperimmunization using different adjuvants (glycerol or aluminium hydroxide), and different adjuvant pretreatments (glycerol or Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)). APS had different manifestations of reproductive pathology in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice: fetal resorption (as a consequence of extreme T-cell activation obtained in the course of pretreatment), and lowering of fecundity (as a consequence of polyclonal B-cell stimulation), respectively. In BALB/c mice fetal resorption coincided with glycerol and CFA pretreatments, while in C57BL/6 mice lowering of fecundity was most obvious in CFA-pretreated mice immunized with TTd in aluminium hydroxide. Both molecular mimicry and polyclonal B-cell activation occur in APS induction, with molecular mimicry effects being dominant in BALB/c mice, and polyclonal cell activation being dominant in C57BL/6 mice. Confirmation of molecular mimicry effects, which in the condition of T-cell stimulation generated fetal resorptions in the BALB/c strain, was achieved by passive infusion of monoclonal antibody (MoAb) T-26 specific for TTd and anti-Î²(2)-glycoprotein I obtained after TTd hyperimunization. High polyclonal B-cell activation in C57BL/6 mice prevented fetal resorption but induced fecundity lowering, as was the case in passive administration of MoAb T-26 in this mouse strain. Passive infusion of anti-idiotypic MoAb Y7 into C57BL/6 mice induced fetal resorptions and confirmed the above suggestion on the protective role of polyclonal B-cell stimulation in fetal resorptions.
