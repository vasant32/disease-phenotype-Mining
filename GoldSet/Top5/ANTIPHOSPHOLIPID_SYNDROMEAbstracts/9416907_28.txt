BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that human monoclonal and polyclonal anticardiolipin antibodies have thrombogenic properties in vivo. Using such a model in which these antibodies have been shown to increase both the size of an induced thrombus and the duration of time in which such a clot lasts, we investigated whether hydroxychloroquine alters the dynamics of such thrombus formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three groups of nine mice were injected with purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) from a patient with the antiphospholipid syndrome (IgG-APS) and then fed with hydroxychloroquine at various doses (100, 6, and 3 mg/kg body wt). Three control groups of mice were also studied, including mice injected with IgG-APS and then fed with placebo, as well as two other groups injected with IgG from normal human serum and fed either hydroxychloroquine or placebo. A standardized thrombogenic injury was subsequently induced in the femoral vein of each mouse and the area (size) of thrombus measured as well as the total period of time that thrombus was present. Mice treated with hydroxychloroquine and IgG-APS showed significantly smaller thrombi that persisted for a shorter period of time compared with animals treated with IgG-APS and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine significantly diminished both thrombus size and total time of thrombus formation in mice previously injected with IgG-APS.
