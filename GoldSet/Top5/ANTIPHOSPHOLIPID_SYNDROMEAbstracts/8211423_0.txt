The so-called antiphospholipid syndrome may be responsible for repeated spontaneous abortion and fetal loss. We examined the plasma of 61 women with either reproductive failure or abruptio placentae for the presence of lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies in an attempt to assess the prevalence of this condition. No patient had haematological abnormalities consistent with the presence of lupus anticoagulant. However, 6 women had anticardiolipin antibodies with normal coagulation tests. The clinical profile together with this laboratory finding allows us to diagnose the antiphospholipid syndrome in these patients. Our incidence is considerably lower than that reported in many other studies but does suggest a place for screening for this condition in patients with recurrent complications of pregnancy.
