PURPOSE: To discover the prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in women with a history of repeated miscarriages. Therapy evaluation of aspirin and prednisone to achieve living term foetus from women in whom antiphospholipid antibodies had been detected and who had become pregnant again. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 82 consecutive women with history of at least of two miscarriages, with no live foetus in either case. 14 women positive for antiphospholipid antibodies who had become pregnant again (group of therapy evaluation), were treated with aspirin (125 mg/d) and prednisone (20 mg/d). 60 normal pregnant women (control group). Lupus anticoagulant evaluation: APTT tests caolin clotting time and APTT system neutralized with platelet phospholipids. Antiphospholipid antibodies: ELISA test. RESULTS: 13.4% were positive to antiphospholipid antibodies (ELISA), and 2.4% were positive in both positive in both test. Therapy evaluation: 75.5% (11 cases) of pregnancies were successful (normal foetus), 14% (2 cases) of fetal losses, and 7% (1 case) of foetal malformations (acranius). CONCLUSIONS: In our study the antiphospholipid antibodies represent one of the main causes of repeated foetal losses. We recommended in cases of infertile women to test for antiphospholipid antibodies regularly. We confirm the effectiveness of the therapy (aspirin and prednisone) in achieving successful pregnancies in patients with a history of infertility.
