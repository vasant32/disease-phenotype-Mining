PURPOSE: To determine the abdominal computed tomographic (CT) findings in patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records from two university medical centers from 1994 through 1997 revealed 215 patients who had a hypercoagulable state attributed to primary or secondary APS. Abdominal CT findings in these patients were reviewed for evidence of large-vessel occlusion or visceral ischemia. RESULTS: In 42 (19.5%) of 215 patients with APS (age range, 32-65 years; mean age, 42 years), abdominal thromboses or ischemic events were detected at CT. Twenty-two (52%) had major vascular thromboses, including those in the inferior vena cava (n = 10), portal and superior mesenteric veins (n = 7), splenic vein (n = 4), and aorta (n = 1). Thirty-six (86%) patients had abdominal visceral ischemia resulting in renal infarction (n = 22), bowel ischemia (n = 13), splenic infarction (n = 6), pancreatitis (n = 3), hepatic infarction (n = 1), and/or hepatic dysfunction with portal hypertension (n = 1). In some patients, more than one abdominal organ and/or vessel was involved. CONCLUSION: Patients who have circulating antiphospholipid antibodies are at risk for major abdominal vascular thromboses and organ infarction. Radiologists must be familiar with this syndrome; they may be the first physicians to suggest the diagnosis on the basis of findings of unusual or recurrent sites of thrombosis, especially in young patients.
