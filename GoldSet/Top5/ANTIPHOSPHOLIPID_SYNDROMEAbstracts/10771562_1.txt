BACKGROUND: Livedo reticularis generalisata (LR) in combination with affection of CNS is referred to as Sneddon's syndrome (SNS). Latest data suggest chronic progressive systemic disorder with occlusion of small and medium sized vessels (e.g., cutis, brain, kidneys, heart, eyes). No conclusive etiology is known, though there are correlations to the antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic secondary vasculitis and coagulopathies. Hereditary and toxic factors seem to play a role in pathogenesis in some cases. CASE REPORT: Diagnostic procedure and clinical course of a 56-year-old woman with dementia and hemiparesis proceeded by LR is reported. MRI-, SPECT- and TCD-findings were congruent with diffuse ischemic lesions of the brain due to affection of small- and medium-sized vessels. Histopathological specimens of the brain, meninges and cutis were non diagnostic. Some laboratory findings suggested vasculitis as an underlying cause. LR improved under immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone and azathioprin. CONCLUSION: SNS does not seem to be a nosological entity. A differentiation between primary (idiopathic) and secondary SNS is useful for different therapeutical approaches.
