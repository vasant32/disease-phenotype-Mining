This is a case report of a 34 years old man with Evans syndrome associated with antiphospholipid-protein antibodies. They include lupus anticoagulant and antibodies against cardiolipin, prothrombin and beta 2-glycoprotein I, detected by ELISA. No thrombotic events were observed. The presence of several antibodies directed against surface cell membrane structures in Evans syndrome suggests a common pathogenetic mechanism.
