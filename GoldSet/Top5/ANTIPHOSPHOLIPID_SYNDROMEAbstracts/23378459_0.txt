 OBJECTIVE: Currently, 3 antiphospholipid assays are widely used clinically [lupus anticoagulant (LAC), anticardiolipin (aCL), and anti-ß-glycoprotein I (anti-ß-GPI)]. LAC is the most specific assay, conferring the highest risk of thrombosis and pregnancy loss, but it cannot be validly performed in an anticoagulated patient. We investigated the usefulness of antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin (anti-PS/PT) and its association with thrombosis. Anti-PS/PT is strongly associated with the presence of LAC. We also studied the association of IgA antiphospholipid isotypes and specific domains of ß-GPI with thrombosis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Stored samples from patients with SLE, with and without past thrombosis, were assayed for antibodies to the whole ß-GPI protein (IgG/IgM/IgA), to ß-GPI domain 1 (IgG), to ß-GPI domain 4/5 (IgA), aCL (IgG/IgM/IgA), and anti-PS/PT (IgG, IgM, and IgG/M). LAC was detected using the dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT) with confirmatory testing. RESULTS: Anti-PS/PT IgG and IgG/M and anti-ß-GPI IgG, IgM, and IgA were highly associated with a history of LAC by dRVVT (p < 0.0001). For all thrombosis, of the traditional ELISA assays, anti-ß-GPI IgA, IgG, and aCL IgA were most associated. Anti-PS/PT IgG and IgG/M had a similar magnitude of association to the traditional ELISA. For venous thrombosis, of the traditional ELISA, anti-ß-GPI (IgG and IgA), anti-PS/PT (IgG and IgG/M), and aCL IgA were associated. Again, anti-PS/PT (IgG and IgG/M) had the same magnitude of association as the traditional ELISA. For stroke, significant association was seen with anti-ß-GPI IgA D4/5. CONCLUSION: In anticoagulated patients, where LAC testing is not valid, anti-PS/PT, either IgG or IgG/IgM, might serve as useful alternative tests to predict a higher risk of thrombosis. Anti-PS/PT antibodies were associated with all thrombosis and with venous thrombosis. IgA isotypes in secondary antiphospholipid syndrome are associated with thrombosis. Anti-ß-glycoprotein domain 1 was not shown to be associated with thrombosis in SLE.
