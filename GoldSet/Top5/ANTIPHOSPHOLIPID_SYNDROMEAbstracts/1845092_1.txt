Recently, the association between anti-phospholipid antibodies (false positive VDRL, lupus anticoagulant or anti-cardiolipin antibody) and diverse clinical manifestations has been termed antiphospholipid syndrome. We report 6 female patients with "primary" antiphospholipid syndrome, not related to connective tissue disorders. Their age ranged from 23 to 66 years and they were followed from 1 to 27 years (mean 9.2). Venous occlusion developed in 4, arterial occlusion in 4 (TIA, convulsive episode and cutaneous thrombotic microangiopathy). Three of 5 had fetal loss and 3/6 developed thrombocytopenia. Leg ulcer, migraine and mitral valvulopathy and peripheral facial paralysis were isolated manifestations in different patients. High titers for type IgG anticardiolipin antibodies were present in all patients. Low titers for IgM antibodies were present in 2. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is discussed.
