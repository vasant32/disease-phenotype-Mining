We report a 26 years old female with a Cerebral Palsy as a consequence of a perinatal vascular accident. She was admitted in August 1996 with a left hemiplegia due to a right M1 median artery thrombotic occlusion, as demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging angiography. Transesophagical bi-dimensional echocardiography showed a right atrial myxoma and ruled out the persistence of an oval foramen. The study of coagulation disorders lead to the diagnosis of a primary antiphospholipid syndrome. We postulate that interleukin-6 produced by the myxoma could trigger an immunological reaction leading to the primary antiphospholipid syndrome.
