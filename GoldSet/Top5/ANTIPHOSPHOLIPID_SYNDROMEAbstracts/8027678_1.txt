The causes of digital necrosis are so diverse that it should be considered not as a surgical but as a medical emergency. In women, digital necrosis first suggests connective tissue disease, and especially Progressive Systemic Sclerosis. In men the causes are more diverse. In this retrospective study, we have tried to identify and categorize the cause of digital necrosis in patients without Progressive Systemic Sclerosis. The medical files of all patients admitted from 1/1/89 to 1/1/93 for digital necrosis were retrospectively reviewed. All patients with Progressive Systemic Sclerosis, either diagnosed at that time or know before, were excluded. All 45 patients in the study had an evaluation of coagulation, vascular risk factors, a cardiac examination and nailfold capillary microscopy, as well as tests for antinuclear antibodies, and cryoglobulinaemia. Other tests were done according to the clinical presentation. Upper limb angiography was done 26 times. Results: there were 10 women and 35 men, mean age 53 years (24-85 years). In the women, the following diagnosis were found: atherosclerosis 1, paraneoplastic syndrome 1, one thrombocythemia, and 6 connective tissue diseases (one dermatopolymyositis, 1 essential cryoglobulinaemia, 2 lupus erythematous and two suspected secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. Twelve men had arterial diseases: 6 thromboangiitis obliterans and 6 obliterans atherosclerosis. Seven times, the cause was local: 5 hammer's syndromes, 2 thoracic outlet syndrome. In the other patients, the causes were extremely diverse: cardiac embolism (4), primary antiphospholipid syndrome (3), polyarteritis nodosa (1), leprosy seroconversion (1), connective tissue disease (3). In 4 patients (3 of whom were smokers) no cause was found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
