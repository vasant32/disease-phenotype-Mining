Using the luminescent-histochemical methods, placenta was studied in 50 normal women with physiological pregnancy and in 35 patients in which the pregnancy progression was complicated by an antiphospholipid syndrome. The following bioamine-positive structures were identified in placenta: decidua, connective tissue and the blood vessels of chorionic plate, terminal villi containing capillaries, and syncytiotrophoblast. In antiphospholipid syndrome, the increase in histamine, catecholamine and serotonin luminescence intensity was detected in these structures. This increase was especially pronounced in histamine luminescence intensity.
