Antiphospholipid syndrome presenting in the neonatal period is very rare. Although antiphospholipid antibodies from mothers with antiphospholipid syndrome can cross the placenta and put their neonates at risk, the occurrence of thrombotic complications in these neonates is uncommon. We present a 10-day-old neonate who developed Klebsiella sepsis with arterial gangrene of the left lower limb. Investigations revealed thrombosis of the left femoral artery with both the mother and the neonate positive for antiphospholipid antibodies. In conclusion, passive transfer of antiphospholipid antibodies from mothers to their offspring can be associated with significant complication in the presence of secondary risk factors.
