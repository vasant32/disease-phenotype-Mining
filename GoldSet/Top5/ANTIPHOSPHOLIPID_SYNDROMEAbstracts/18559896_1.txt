Visceral artery aneurysms are an uncommon form of abdominal vascular disease and represent a rare clinical entity; however, 10-20% will rupture, which is associated with a significant mortality rate of 20-70% depending on the location of the aneurysm. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) was originally described in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and usually presents with deep venous thrombosis, recurrent abortion and stroke. The development of vasoocclusive disease in APS has been well documented, but the presence of concurrent aneurysms in some patients may cause diagnostic and therapeutic confusion. We report on a patient with primary APS who presented unusually with multiple visceral large aneurysms.
