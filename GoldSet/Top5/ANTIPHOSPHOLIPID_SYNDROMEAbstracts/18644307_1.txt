In 1686, Thomas Sydenham described a syndrome of chorea occurring in youth which was subsequently shown to be a complication of rheumatic fever. An association between chorea and antiphospholipid antibodies has been reported since 1985. We report two females presenting with chorea, aged 17 and 22, who fulfilled the Jones' criteria for rheumatic fever and concurrently had antiphospholipid antibodies detected in serum. A third patient presented at the age of 16 with two bouts of Sydenham's chorea; no assays for antiphospholipid antibodies were performed at the time but 13 years later she was found to have high titres of anticardiolipin antibodies. No patient had abnormalities in the basal ganglia detected on magnetic resonance imaging. Sydenham's chorea may be part of the spectrum of antiphospholipid-associated neurological disease.
