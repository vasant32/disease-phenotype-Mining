BACKGROUND: A 32-year old female with primary antiphospholipid syndrome presented 8 months after mitral valve reconstruction with progressive exertional dyspnea and echocardiographically demonstrable critical mitral stenosis and regurgitation. Tachycardia, weight loss, sleep disturbances and increasing nervosity led to the diagnosis of concomitant hyperthyroidism. After the patient stopped the oral anticoagulation by herself, a 'catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome' with multiple microthromboembolic events in several organs developed rapidly within a few weeks. Severe respiratory failure was observed 14 days after admission at our hospital because of a pulmonary edema. TREATMENT: Removal of the annuloplasty ring and alloplastic mitral valve replacement with a 25 mm bilifleat valve. Postoperatively, the patient was placed on oral anticoagulation. Several pre- and postoperative plasmaphereses lowered the level of antiphospholipid antibodies. The patient additionally underwent radioiodtherapy 5 months postoperatively. RESULTS: While hemodynamics and diuresis remained sufficient, ventilatory support with tracheostomy was necessary for 16 postoperative days to achieve stable respiration. Thirty months later, the patient is well and without further cardiac and neurological dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Secondary cardiac valve operations on patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome may be successfully performed within a multidisciplinary approach. Oral anticoagulation remains the treatment of choice to prevent further thromboembolic events.
