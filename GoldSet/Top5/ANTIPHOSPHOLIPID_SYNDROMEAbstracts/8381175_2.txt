In order to approach an understanding of the mechanisms of fetal death in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome we investigated the association between protein C activity and anticardiolipin antibody. Protein C activity in vivo was decreased in some patients with recurrent fetal loss and a high ACA titer. This study suggests that anticardiolipin antibody in patients with recurrent fetal loss may inhibit activation of protein C by thrombomodulin.
