Chorea gravidarum is a rare movement disorder of pregnancy with a broad differential diagnosis. Although often a benign condition, it may indicate underlying acute rheumatic fever, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or a hypercoagulable state. However, now that rheumatic fever is rare in western countries, chorea gravidarum occurs most commonly in patients with chronic rheumatic heart disease. Heightened awareness of chorea gravidarum and the morbidity of the often associated rheumatic heart disease, particularly in immigrants from developing countries, is essential for early diagnosis and effective management. A case of chorea gravidarum in a woman with rheumatic mitral stenosis is described. The diagnostic approach, pathophysiology and management of this rare condition are discussed.
