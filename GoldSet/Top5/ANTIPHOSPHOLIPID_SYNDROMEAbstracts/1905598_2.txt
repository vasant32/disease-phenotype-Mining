A 65-year-old white female without lupus developed concurrent thrombocytopenia and disturbed arterial circulation to the brain and lower leg (a minor stroke and lower leg gangrene, necessitating amputation). Laboratory studies disclosed high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies. Anticoagulant treatment restored circulation in the remaining leg and also normalized platelet levels. This case emphasizes the importance of searching for anticardiolipin antibodies in unexplained thrombotic events.
