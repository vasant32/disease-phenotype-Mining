The occurrence of lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies was demonstrated in a girl affected by recurrent episodes of visual disturbances, with ophthalmologic evidence of visual impairment and sometimes accompanied by migraine. Systemic lupus erythematosus was excluded on the basis of both clinical and serologic criteria and the diagnosis of primary antiphospholipid syndrome was made. Vascular pathogenesis was suggested by the characteristic symptoms. The serologic demonstration of antiphospholipid antibodies made it possible to relate the illness to an immune-mediated thrombotic tendency. This patient demonstrated that the diagnosis of primary antiphospholipid syndrome must always be considered in focal cerebral or retinal ischemia in childhood.
