A 40-year-old woman presented with fever, dysarthria, and left hemiparesis. Diagnostic imaging detected an infarction in the right cerebrum; lupus anticoagulant was positive. A T4N3M0 adenocarcinoma coexisted in the left lung, which was irradiated once. Two days later, the superior mesenteric artery was occluded. The bowel was widely resected but she died of hepatic infarction. The lung cancer may have triggered catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome.
