Portal vein thrombosis is a rare occurrence, and often an underlying hypercoagulable state can be found. Recently, there has been growing interest and recognition of the antiphospholipid syndrome in association with acquired hypercoagulable state. This syndrome consists of the association of lupus anticoagulant or antiphospholipid antibodies with arterial or venous thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and spontaneous abortion. We report a case of portal vein thrombosis associated with the antiphospholipid syndrome. In our patient, chronic liver disease, hepatobiliary infection, abdominal malignancies, myeloproliferative disorders, and inherited coagulation disorders were excluded. This case report suggests that serum antiphospholipid antibodies should be investigated in patients with portal vein thrombosis of unexplained etiology.
