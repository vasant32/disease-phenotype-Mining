This study aims for the presentation of the first reported case of adalimumab-associated antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and review of the literature on adalimumab-induced vasculitis and APS. A case of APS associated with adalimumab use in a 67-year-old woman is reported. The English medical literature was reviewed for antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents and their association with APS and vasculitis. Adalimumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against TNF alpha that is widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, and Crohn's disease. Literature review reveals several cases of anti-TNF-induced vasculitis including cases associated with adalimumab. We report the first case of adalimumab-induced APS in a 67-year-old woman who developed APS and vasculitis associated with de novo positive anti-cardiolipin (aCL) antibody following the third dose of adalimumab therapy for the treatment of spondyloarthropathy. This is the first case demonstrating that a short course of adalimumab therapy may induce immunoglobulin M aCL autoantibodies leading to APS. With the growing use of anti-TNF medications in immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases, adalimumab and other anti-TNF medications should be considered as a possible explanation for APS.
