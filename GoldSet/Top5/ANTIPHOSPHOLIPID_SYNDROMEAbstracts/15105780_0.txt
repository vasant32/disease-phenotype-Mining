INTRODUCTION: A primary antiphospholipid syndrome is a very rare cause of adrenal haemorrhage. OBSERVATION: A 51 year-old man presented with a unilateral adrenal haemorrhage, enhanced by the prescription of Synacthène during the 4 days that preceded. There was no adrenal deficiency but the immunological control revealed the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies. After 2 years of follow-up, adrenal controls have not shown any underlying tumour or endocrine insufficiency. COMMENTS: Adrenal involvement is described in the anti-phospholipid syndrome and may present in the form of adrenal deficiency in the case of occasionally only microscopic bilateral haemorrhages. Furthermore, Synacthène is known to induce adrenal haemorrhages although this complication remains rare. Moreover, any unilateral adrenal haemorrhage requires subsequent follow-up for several months or even years in order to eliminate any underlying tumour and to control the absence of any adrenal deficiency if the involvement is bilateral.
