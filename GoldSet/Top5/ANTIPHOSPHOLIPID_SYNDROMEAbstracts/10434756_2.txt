A 7-year-old girl with catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome was described. She firstly admitted to the local hospital with the complaints of persistent fever and abdominal pain, and was diagnosed as systemic lupus erythematosus with the laboratory findings as follows; positive for antinuclear antibody, anti-DNA antibody, and platelet-associated IgG, thrombocytopenia, and hypocomplementemia. 10 days after the initiation of oral prednisolone, she suddenly manifested tonic convulsion and unconsciousness accompanied by high fever. Because of the unresponsiveness to the methylprednisolone pulse therapy for supposed CNS lupus, she was transferred to our hospital. Her unconsciousness persisted, and pulsation on dorsalis pedis was not palpable on admission. Laboratory investigation revealed the falsely positive VDRL, a prolonged aPTT, positive for lupus-anticoagulant and antiphospholipid antibody. The magnetic resonance image demonstrated multiple spotty hyperintensity (T2) in the brain consistent with multiple hemorrhagic infarcts. Arteriogram demonstrated the infarct of dorsalis pedis, and coronary aneurysms. These findings were compatible with the criteria of catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, she was diagnosed as catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. The plasma exchange and subsequent cyclophosphamide-pulse therapy, which was given once a month for first 6 months, and later, at 3 months intervals, was effectively administered. This combination and oral anti-thrombotic therapy revealed effective for this kind of fatal disorder.
