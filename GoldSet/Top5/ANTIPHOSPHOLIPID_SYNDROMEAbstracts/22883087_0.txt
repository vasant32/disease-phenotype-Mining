 OBJECTIVES: To observe the clinical and coronary features of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: Among 2877 SLE inpatients (age ≥ 18 years, male 363, female 2514) admitted in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 1999 to October 2009, 33 patients [mean age (50.7 ± 12.8) years] were diagnosed with CAD and coronary angiogram was available in 20 out of these 33 patients. Clinical and coronary features of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The incidence of CAD was significantly higher in male SLE patients than in female patients [2.48% (9/363) vs. 0.95% (24/2514), P = 0.022]. Patients with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome were more likely to suffer from CAD [5.76% (8/139) vs. 0.91% (25/2738), P < 0.001]. Myocardial infarction was the major form of CAD (24/33). Coronary artery angiographic changes included coronary stenosis and occlusions, coronary aneurysms and acute thrombosis and multi-vessel lesions was found in 75.0% (15/20) patients with SLE and CAD. CONCLUSIONS: Male SLE patients and patients with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome are at higher risk for CAD. Myocardial infarction and multi-vessel lesions are common in SLE patients with CAD.
