OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of serum anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-beta2-GPI) antibodies and other antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To study their diagnostic value for the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). METHODS: Anti-beta2-GPI and IgG anticardiolipin (aCL) were determined in sera from 102 consecutive patients with SLE using ELISA. Serum and plasma tests were also done for lupus anticoagulant (LAC), syphilis, and antibodies to dsDNA. Clinical and laboratory features of APS were observed. RESULTS: Prevalences were 23.5% for aCL and 18.6% for anti-beta2-GPI. Correlations between the presence of aCL and anti-beta2-GPI and between their titers were statistically significant (p<0.0001). No associations were found between anti-beta2-GPI and disease activity criteria (SLEDAI, ECLAM, dsDNA). Anti-beta2-GPI were significantly associated with LAC (p = 0.005), APS (p = 0.005), and a high aCL titer (aCL > 5 SD; p< or =0.001). LAC was the best diagnostic criterion for APS. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that determination of anti-beta2-GPI in addition to aCL and LAC is unlikely to improve the diagnosis of APS in patients with SLE.
