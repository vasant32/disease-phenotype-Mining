OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association between HLA class II haplotypes and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). METHODS: HLA DRB1, DQB1 and DQA1 genotypes were determined by the polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers in 83 Caucasoid British patients with APS. The genotype frequencies were compared between subgroups of patients and 177 healthy controls. RESULTS: DQB1*0604/5/6/7/9-DQA1*0102-DRB1*1302 and DQB1*0303-DQA1*0201-DRB1*0701 haplotypes showed significantly positive correlations with APS [P=0.0087 and P=0.0012, respectively]. The association of the former was enhanced in primary APS patients with anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies (anti-beta 2GPI) [odds ratio 6.2, 95% confidence interval (2.2-17.6), P=0.0014, corrected P=0.042]. CONCLUSIONS: These alleles and haplotypes might affect anti-ss2GPI production and APS development in different and heterogeneous fashion.
