The immunomodulatory potential of a diet enriched with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids was analysed in na√Øve mice with experimental antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) induced by active immunization with H-3, a human anti-beta-2-glycoprotein-I (anti-betaGPI) monoclonal antibody (mAb). Fetal loss and other clinical manifestations of APS were prevented in the group of APS mice upon exposure to the enriched n-3 diet compared to the control group. The titers of anti-betaGPI were significantly lower (in O.D. at 405 nm, 1.387+/-0.232 in comparison to non-treated mice 0.637+/-0. 111, P< 0.05). The reduced titer of anti-betaGPI antibodies in the sera of the treated mice was associated with a reduced number of anti-betaGPI forming cells in cultured splenocytes (84+/-14, antibody-forming cells (AFC)/10(5)cells in comparison to 37+/-4 AFC/10(5)cells (P< 0.02).In addition to the suppression of the humoral response in mice with experimental APS fed with linseed oil, we also observed an inhibitory effect on the cellular response. The T-cell response to anti-betaGPI was lower in comparison to mice immunized with H-3 anti-betaGPI mAB, which were kept on a normal diet. These results indicate that polyunsaturated fatty acids may improve clinical and laboratory parameters of APS. The beneficial effects of diets enriched with n-3 should be further examined as a potential mode of therapy for patients with APS.
