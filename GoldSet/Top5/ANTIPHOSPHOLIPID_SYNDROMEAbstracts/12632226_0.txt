We report a case of polyvalvar disease and recurrent thrombosis in a 2-year-old boy due to primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. His diagnosis was delayed, and he was treated for other diagnoses, including culture-negative endocarditis. Primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is rarely discussed in the pediatric cardiology literature, and this case highlights the need for early diagnosis to prevent recurrent valve dysfunction and thrombosis.
