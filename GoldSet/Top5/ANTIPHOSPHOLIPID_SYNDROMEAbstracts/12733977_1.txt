Blood plasma samples from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus having the anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome were found to contain anti-plasminogen antibodies of the IgG class. The titers of anti-plasminogen autoantibodies of the IgG class were elevated in these patients compared with normal controls. Part of the pool of IgG anti-plasminogen antibodies reacts with an epitope in the lysine-binding sites of plasminogen. Anti-plasminogen IgG isolated from patients' blood plasma is specific only for a native epitope of human plasminogen passively adsorbed on immunosorbent micro-titration plate. As shown by enzyme immunoassay, autoantibodies to plasminogen of the IgG class cross-react with human fibrinogen.
