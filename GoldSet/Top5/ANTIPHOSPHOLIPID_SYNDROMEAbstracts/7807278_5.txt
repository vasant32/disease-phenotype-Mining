We measured anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in plasma samples from 214 women with a history of recurrent spontaneous abortions by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) utilizing solid phase cardiolipin (CL) and beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta 2-GPI). Sixteen patients (7.5%) were positive for beta 2-GPI-dependent aCL. Though beta 2-GPI appeared to enhance the binding of aCL, beta 2-GPI-independent aCL were also observed in these patients (4.7%). The patients were classified into three groups on the basis of their medical history, and analysis of data of individual groups revealed that the incidence of beta 2-GPI-dependent aCL was significantly higher in patients who had experienced at least one fetal loss in the second or third trimester.
