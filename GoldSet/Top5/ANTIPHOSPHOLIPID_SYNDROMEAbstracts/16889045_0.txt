AIM: To ascertain clinical and morphological features of lupus nephritis (LN) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Immunological markers of SLE and APS, clinical picture, urine indices were examined in 138 patients with SLE, APS and renal dysfunction. RESULTS: LN associated with APS is characterized with marked arterial hypertension, such patients had arterial thromboses more frequently than patients with isolated LN. Patients with anticardiolipin antibodies have arteriolosclerosis, in APS - diffuse interstitial sclerosis. CONCLUSION: Renal impairment in SLE may run not only with LN but also with thrombotic microangiopathy modifying clinical symptoms and course of the disease.
