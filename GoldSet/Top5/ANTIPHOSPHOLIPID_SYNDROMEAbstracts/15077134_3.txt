A 12-year-old girl presented with arthritis, myalgia, anemia and positive ANA. Subsequently, she developed recurrent episodes of pulmonary hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, CNS abnormalities, skin ulcers and diffuse calcinosis. This was followed by secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. Despite vigorous immunosuppression, the patient became bedridden. A peripheral blood stem cell autograft was offered when she developed pulmonary hypertension and digital ischemia at the age of 16 years. The post-transplantation course was uneventful. Liquefaction of calcinosis nodules with improvement of mobility occurred gradually. She is now 24 months post-transplant with no sign of disease activity and total disappearance of calcinosis nodules.
