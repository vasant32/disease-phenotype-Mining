We report one patient who presented with a spontaneous bleeding complication under phenprocoumon therapy. Oral anticoagulation was initiated due to deep-vein thrombosis which was attributed to an antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Coagulation analysis revealed a strong and selective reduction of factor IX (F IX) activity to 1%, whereas the other vitamin K-dependent factors (II, VII, X), the prothrombin time and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were within the therapeutic range. After withdrawal of phenprocoumon, all vitamin K-dependent factors including F IX normalized. Because the patient suffered from a recurrence of thrombotic events, he was re-exposed to phenprocoumon and the disproportionate decline of F IX was observed again. These findings indicate an increased sensitivity of F IX to vitamin K antagonists, representing an uncommon mechanism associated with bleeding complications under oral anticoagulant treatment.
