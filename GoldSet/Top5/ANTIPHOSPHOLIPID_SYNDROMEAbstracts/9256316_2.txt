We report the case of a 38 y old man with antiphospholipid syndrome and exceptionally extensive central vein thrombosis in the right internal jugular vein, superior vena cava, and both subclavian veins. In spite of intensive anticoagulation therapy there was only a partial response. We suggest the MR angiography be the reference standard for diagnosis in this type of patient.
