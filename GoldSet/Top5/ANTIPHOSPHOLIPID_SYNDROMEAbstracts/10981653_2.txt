A 25-year-old Japanese woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) had myocardial dysfunction. Heart catheterization showed normal coronary anatomy. Left ventricular cineangiography demonstrated hypokinesis in the anterior and posterior segments. Myocardial scintigraphy revealed patchy defects in the regions unrelated to coronary arteries. These data suggested that the myocardial dysfunction was due to microvasculopthy. In addition, it was speculated that the microvasculopathy was caused by vasculitis but not by thrombi, since she did not have antiphospholipid syndrome. In support of this speculation, corticosteroid therapy without any thrombolytic agents was effective. This report represents the first live patient with SLE in whom myocardial dysfunction due to microvasculopathy has been demonstrated.
