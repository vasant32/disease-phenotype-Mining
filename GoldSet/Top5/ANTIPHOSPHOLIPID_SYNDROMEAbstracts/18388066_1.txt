Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized with arterial and venous thrombosis. In this article, a 38-year-old man presented with headache and swelling of his left limb, which had lasted for 2 months. Duplex ultrasonography showed thrombosis of the left femoral vein. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging also showed cerebral sinus thrombosis. Serological examination showed that antiphospholipid syndrome was the underlying disease condition in this patient. Despite adequate anticoagulant therapy, deep vein thrombosis and cerebral sinus thrombosis exacerbated, resulting in inferior vena cava occlusion, papilloedema, and abducent nerve paralysis. Optic canal decompression and cistern-peritoneal shunt operation were performed, following which his neurological symptoms were relieved. The occurrence of cerebral sinus thrombosis as initial presentation of antiphospholipid syndrome is extremely rare and remains a diagnostic challenge. Although the clinical presentation is highly variable, the diagnosis should be considered in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome presenting with recent unusual headaches. Improved diagnosis and treatment strategy may ultimately improve the clinical outcome of these patients.
