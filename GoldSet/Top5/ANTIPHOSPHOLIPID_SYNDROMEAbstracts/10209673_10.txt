Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are found in a variety of autoimmune diseases, and are thought to predispose to arterial and venous thrombosis. These antibodies, when investigated in different assays in vitro, activate endothelial cells and promote uptake of modified LDL to macrophages. These observations suggest that aPL can contribute to atheroma development by targeting some of the sequential steps that constitute early atherogenesis. If substantiated by large-scale clinical trials, the pro-atherogenic properties of aPL may merit screening and intervention programs in selected populations.
