 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) in subsequent thromboembolic events and mortality in a prospective follow-up of 89 patients with severe, nonspecific valvular heart disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 1, 1993, and March 31, 1994, 89 patients with valvular heart disease were assessed for the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant. The primary end point was thromboembolic events, and the secondary end points were cardiovascular mortality and overall mortality. RESULTS: All patients were followed up for a mean of 59 months; 1 patient (without aPLs) was lost to follow-up. Nineteen patients had increased titers of aPLs. Thromboembolic events were significantly more frequent in the aPL-positive group than in the aPL-negative group (7/19 [37%] vs 8/70 [11%]; P=.01). Cardiovascular mortality tended to be higher in the aPL-positive group than in the aPL-negative group (3 [16%] vs 6 [9%]; P = .40). However, in multivariate Cox analysis, presence of aPLs was not an independent risk factor for thromboembolic events. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that patients with severe valvular heart disease and aPLs have an increased risk for developing thromboembolic events.
