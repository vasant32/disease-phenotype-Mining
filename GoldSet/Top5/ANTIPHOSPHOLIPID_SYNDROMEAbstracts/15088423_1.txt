We present a case of a 32-year-old male survivor of two myocardial infarctions, without any classic risk factor of atherosclerosis. Laboratory and genetic diagnostic tests revealed primary antiphospholipid syndrome, mutation in blood coagulation factor V (Leiden) and mild hyperhomocysteinemia, which could be predisposing factors for coronary artery occlusions and should especially be considered in a young patient without apparent cardiovascular risk factors. Additional anticoagulation and substitutional treatment of the folic acid, vitamin B6 and B12 are effective and the continues to do well at home 3 years after discharge.
