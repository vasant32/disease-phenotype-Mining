Autoimmune complications in the context of primary immunodeficiency diseases represent a well-known phenomenon, and this is widely recognized also for Selective Immunoglobulin A deficiency (IgAD), the most common primary antibody deficiency (PAD). Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare immune-mediated, difficult to treat, disorder in which the cartilaginous tissues are the target for inflammation and damage. Ocular inflammatory manifestations in RP are frequent and often sight-threatening. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired prothrombotic state related to circulating autoantibodies against phospholipids and/or their cofactors. Rare reports of APS associated to RP, PAD and APS or PAD and RP are available.
