Valvular involvement is common in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) with increased risk of thrombo-embolic events. We report a patient with APS and multiple cerebral infarcts. Echocardiography demonstrated verrucous vegetations of the mitral valve in keeping with marantic endocarditis. The patient underwent successful mitral valve replacement. Post-operative clinical and echocardiographic follow-up showed excellent short term results.
