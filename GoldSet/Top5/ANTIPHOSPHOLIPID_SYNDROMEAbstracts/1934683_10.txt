Forty-one patients (31 women, 10 men) aged 15-56 (mean age, 38) with Sneddon's syndrome characterised by cerebrovascular disease and widespread livedo reticularis in the absence of typical lupus features were studied. 16 patients (39%) had clinical and/or electrocardiographic signs of ischemic heart disease, with 2 of them having survived myocardial infarction. Cardiac murmurs (usually mitral systolic) were heard in 15 patients (37%). Echocardiography revealed mitral valve thickening in 13 of 32 tested patients (41%). Anticardiolipin antibodies were found in 22 patients (54%) and lupus anticoagulant in 25 of 38 tested patients (66%). In 6 patients (15%) neither anticardiolipin antibodies nor lupus anticoagulant were observed. Anticardiolipin antibodies were more often present in patients with ischemic heart disease (12 of 16), than in those without (10 of 25) (p less than 0.05). Mitral valve thickening was revealed more often in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (12 of 26 patients) than in those without (1 of 6); however, a statistically significant difference was not observed.
