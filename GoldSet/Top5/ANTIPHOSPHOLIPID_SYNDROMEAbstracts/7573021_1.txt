We report the case of a 66-year-old woman with mixed connective tissue disease (MCD) who had recurrent renal infarcts and renal insufficiency with only mildly increased serum anticardiolipin antibodies. After low-dose aspirin therapy, the renal lesions resolved, and renal function returned to normal within 3 weeks.
