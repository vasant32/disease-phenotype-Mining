Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) represent a heterogeneous population reacting with negatively charged, less frequently neutral phospholipids and/or phospholipid-binding serum proteins. The study was made of antibodies to a wide spectrum of phospholipids: to negatively charged phospholipids such as phosphatide acid (aPA), cardiolipin (aCL), phosphatidylcholine (aPS), phosphatidylinositol (aPI), phosphatidylglycerol (aPG) and to neutrally charged phospholipid--phosphatidylcholine (aPC)--in 54 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 29 patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS). The test for lupus anticoagulant (LAC) was also made. aPL in SLE patients free of antiphospholipid syndrome were detected in 61, 36 and 9% (aPC, aPS and aPA, aCL, respectively). aPI and aPG did not exceed normal values. 81% of SLE patients with antiphospholipid syndrome were LAC positive and 88% aPL positive. 60, 53, 44, 40, 13 and 17 were positive to aPC, aPA, aPS, aCL, aPG and aPI, respectively. Among patients with PAPS, the highest positivity was by LAC, occurrence of the other aPL was the same as in SLE patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. aCL, aPA, aPC, aPS, aPG and aPI were found in 55, 52, 41, 38, 31 and 21% of cases, respectively. In clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome and negative tests for LAC and aCL it is advisable to make tests for aPS and aPC. aPC occur in SLE patients more frequently than the other aPL: in 63% of SLE patients free of antiphospholipid syndrome and in 60% of SLE patients with this syndrome. Antibodies to other phospholipids, but not to cardiolipin, were present in SLE + APS in half of the cases but in SLE + PAPS in one third of the patients. Occurrence of aCL in the serum of SLE + PAPS patients is associated with the presence of antibodies to any other phospholipid irrespective of the charge. The severity of vascular changes did not correlate with the number of aPL variant found in the serum.
