The presence of antiphospholipid Ab is associated with increased risk of thrombosis. The monocyte-endothelial cell interaction has been suggested to play a key role at the site of vascular injury during thrombosis. Therefore, we tested the effect of anticardiolipin Abs (aCL) on the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in HUVEC. We found that monoclonal aCL as well as IgG fractions from patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS-IgG) could induce the production of MCP-1 in HUVEC. The ability of IgG aCL to induce MCP-1 production could be abrogated by preabsorption with cardiolipin liposomes. Simultaneous addition of either monoclonal aCL or APS-IgG with IL-1beta resulted in synergistic increase in MCP-1 production, whereas the addition of control IgG lacking aCL activity did not alter IL-1beta-induced levels of MCP-1. MCP-1 mRNA expression was also up-regulated when HUVEC were incubated with either APS-IgG or monoclonal aCL, and down-regulated by the treatment of dexamethasone. In addition, we found that serum levels of MCP-1 in 76 systemic lupus erythematosus patients correlated well with the titers of IgG aCL. Collectively, these results indicate that aCL could promote endothelial cell-monocyte cross-talk by enhancing the endothelial production of MCP-1, thereby shifting the hemostatic balance toward the prothrombotic state of APS.
