Granulomatosis and angiitis (GPA) is a multisystemic disease characterized by a granulomatous inflammation, tissue necrosis, and vasculitis of small and medium-sized blood vessels. Although the disease has a predilection for the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and kidneys, any organ system may be affected. Here, we present a case of generalized GPA manifested initially by necrotizing isolated parotitis and later by pulmonary-renal syndrome. Simultaneously with pulmonary hemorrhage, our patient developed an antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) presenting with deep vein thrombosis and strongly positive lupus anticoagulant. To the best of our knowledge the coincidence of parotitis and pulmonary-renal syndrome due to GPA and APS has never been reported previously. Concomitant venous thromboembolism may be life-threatening in a patient with GPA. Early diagnosis and institution of the proper therapy are critical in order to prevent organ damage.
