Livedoid vasculopathy is a rare condition which predominantly affects young women. It is characterized by intense painful purpuric maculae in the legs, ankles and feet, due to thrombosis of the small and medium-sized dermal vessels, in the absence of vasculitis. Livedoid vasculopathy has been frequently associated with hypercoagulable states and antiphospholipid syndrome. We describe a 34-year-old White woman suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus, livedo reticularis, haemolytic anaemia, severe thrombocytopenia and recurrent venous thrombosis who was admitted to the hospital for extremely painful purpuric lesions in her lower limbs. The clinical and histological findings were diagnostic of livedoid vasculopathy. Once the initial sub-therapeutic international normalized ratio levels were corrected, livedoid vasculopathy did not recur. Tests for antiphospholipid antibodies were repeatedly negative. This case, the first reported of livedoid vasculopathy in a patient with seronegative antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus, draws attention to livedoid vasculopathy, a thrombotic dermopathy that may be under-diagnosed in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.
