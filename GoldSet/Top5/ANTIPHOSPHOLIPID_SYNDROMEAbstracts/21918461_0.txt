Women with recurrent pregnancy loss are offered Factor V Leiden (F5) and/or prothrombin G20210A (F2) testing to identify candidates for anticoagulation to improve outcomes. A systematic literature review was performed to estimate test performance, effect sizes, and treatment effectiveness. Electronic searches were performed through April 2011, with review of references from included articles. English-language studies addressed analytic validity, clinical validity, and/or clinical utility and satisfied predefined inclusion. Adequate evidence showed high analytic sensitivity and specificity for F5 and F2 testing. Evidence for clinical validity was adequate. The summary odds ratio for association of recurrent pregnancy loss with F5 in case-control studies was 2.02 (95% confidence interval, 1.60-2.55), with moderate heterogeneity and suggestion of publication bias. Longitudinal studies in women with recurrent pregnancy loss or unselected cohorts showed F5 carriers were more likely to have a subsequent loss than noncarriers (odds ratios: 1.93 and 2.03, respectively). Results for F2 testing were similar. For clinical utility, evidence was adequate that anticoagulation treatments were ineffective (except in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome) and had treatment-associated harms. The certainty of evidence is moderate (high, moderate, and low) that anticoagulation of women with recurrent pregnancy loss and F5/F2 variants would currently lead to net harms.
