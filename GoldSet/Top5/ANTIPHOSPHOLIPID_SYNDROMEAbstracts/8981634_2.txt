Patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome as well as those with a lack in the prostacyclin synthesis stimulating plasma factor (PF) are prone to develop thrombophilia and are at a higher clinical risk for vascular disease. As patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome have been reported to show elevated lipoprotein (Lp)(a) levels, we re-examined all our patients known to have an inborn or an acquired persistent deficiency of PF. Their non-affected relatives served as controls. In addition, 36 patients suffering from clinically manifested atherosclerosis as well as 16 healthy adults, all of them having elevated Lp(a) levels (> 30 mg/dl), were screened for a PF deficiency. In fact, all the patients with a deficient PF activity showed elevated Lp(a) values. While the prevalence of PF deficiency ranges about 1-2%, in 7 (19%) patients with clinically manifested atherosclerosis and 3 (19%) healthy adults with elevated Lp(a) this defect was found. The findings demonstrate an association between PF deficiency and Lp(a), indicating a biochemical interaction which needs to be further elucidated.
