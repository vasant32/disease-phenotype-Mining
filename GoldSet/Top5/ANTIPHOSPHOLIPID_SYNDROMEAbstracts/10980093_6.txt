In this report we describe the case of a 19-year-old woman who had right-sided hemiparesis. In search of a source of embolism, we performed transthoracic echocardiography, which showed a large, complex, and irregular multilobulated left ventricle mass adherent to the endocardial surface. Open-heart surgery was performed. The mass was removed, and histologic examination confirmed the thrombotic material with focal regions of calcification. The diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibodies syndrome was confirmed by an anticardiolipin antibodies test.
