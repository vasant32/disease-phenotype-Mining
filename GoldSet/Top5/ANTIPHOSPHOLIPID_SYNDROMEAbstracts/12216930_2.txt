A 41-year-old woman diagnosed with aortoarteritis since 1988 was admitted with unstable angina. She also had anemia, thrombocytopenia, aortic regurgitation and pulmonary artery hypertension. She gave a history of recurrent fetal loss and myocardial infarction, following which angioplasty to the left anterior descending artery had been done. After investigation, a diagnosis of aortoarteritis with systemic lupus erythematosus and associated antiphospholipid antibody syndrome was made. Aortoarteritis may coexist with systemic lupus erythematosus and associated antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
