A 62-year-old diabetic man was admitted to our hospital because of acute myocardial infarction. Emergent coronary angiography showed multiple thromboembolic occlusions in the distal circumflex and anterior descending arteries. For the first 2 weeks of hospitalization, he suffered multiple organ manifestations including the gastrointestinal, central nervous, renal and respiratory systems. The anticardiolipin beta2GP1 complex antibody titer on the 15th day was as high as 27.2 U/l (normal value < 3.5). These clinical manifestations and laboratory findings suggested catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. He was discharged on the 83rd day with anticoagulant therapy and regular hemodialysis. Acute myocardial infarction is rare as the initial manifestation of catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
