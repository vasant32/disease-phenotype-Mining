The association of antiphospholipid antibodies and Takayasu arteritis is very rare and few cases have been reported in the past. Though Takayasu arteritis patients were treated in the past with stenting, there have been no reports of patients with this association being treated with carotid stenting. We present here a young Bahraini female with Takayasu arteritis, primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase C 677 T and A 1298 C polymorphism, who was treated with carotid stenting and anticoagulants.
