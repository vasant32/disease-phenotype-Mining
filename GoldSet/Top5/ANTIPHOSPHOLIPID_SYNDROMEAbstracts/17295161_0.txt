A 51-year-old woman with antiphospholipid syndrome was readmitted to the hospital two years after successful surgical pulmonary thrombendarteriectomy for severe chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Exertional dyspnea, chest pain and ECG pattern could suggest relapse of pulmonary thromboembolism. However, no signs of pulmonary hypertension were found at echocardiography. Coronary angiography revealed proximal critical occlusion in the left anterior descending artery which was successfully treated with PTCA and stenting. Coronary artery disease may mimic relapse of CTEPH and this should be remembered especially in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, who have increased risk of coronary artery disease especially in the presence of other classical risk factors.
