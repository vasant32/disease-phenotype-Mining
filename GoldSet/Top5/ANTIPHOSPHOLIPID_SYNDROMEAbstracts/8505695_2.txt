Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with and without heat inactivation of bovine serum used for plastic surface blockade. Untreated sera samples from primary antiphospholipid syndrome patients (PAS) and healthy blood donors (HBD) were tested. A significant decrease of ACA titers of PAS sera occurred with inactivated bovine serum blockade ELISA when compared with basal ELISA. In HBD sera there was no significant change. Probably, as happens with normal human serum, heating for normal bovine serum produces an increase in ACA titers. This bovine ACA may react with cardiolipin, and when human samples are added, they find antigen sites occupied, resulting in a spurious decrease of ACA titers.
