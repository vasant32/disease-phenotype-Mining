Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a rare manifestation of primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). We describe a patient with primary APS and refractory recurrent episodes of DAH. The patient was admitted 15 times due to recurrent episodes of DAH in a period of 18 months. Multiple immunosuppressive drugs did not improve his condition. Two years after his presentation, he was treated with rituximab (two doses of 1 g, 2 weeks apart). Six months later, the attacks of DAH have gradually disappeared. In a follow-up of more than 2 years after he received rituximab, the patient has had no further admissions due to DAH. Levels of antiphospholipid antibodies were measured during follow-up of 4 years. Anti-β2 glycoprotein IgG titer decreased to normal 6 months after therapy but anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody titer increased. We conclude that rituximab caused a dramatic clinical response in this patient. Anti-β2 glycoprotein IgG correlated better with the clinical response in this patient than aCL.
