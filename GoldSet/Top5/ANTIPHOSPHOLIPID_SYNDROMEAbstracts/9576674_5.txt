In three patients with recurrent episodes of acute transverse myelopathy, spinal MR imaging during each episode showed areas of hyperintensity on proton density- and T2-weighted images with inconsistent contrast enhancement. Cranial MR imaging, laboratory screenings, and CSF analysis showed only increased titers of anticardiolipin antibodies. Although a causative role in neurologic conditions has not been established conclusively, an association between these antibodies and acute transverse myelopathy and its recurrences cannot be ignored.
