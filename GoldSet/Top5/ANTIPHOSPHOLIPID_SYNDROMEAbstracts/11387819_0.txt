BACKGROUND: The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (AAS), which is characterized by thromboembolic events and/or fetal loss and/or low platelet count associated with antiphospholipid antibodies, may evolve with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The presence of AAS among young patients with AMI ranges from 14% to 21%, and this condition implies specific therapeutic attitudes as new thrombotic events may occur, according to some authors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was undertaken with 25 patients aged > or = 65 years with AMI that were admitted to our institution during one year who were compared with control patients with similar risk factors. IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) were measured in the first 24 hours since the onset of AMI symptoms and three months later. RESULTS: The follow-up ranged from three months to one year. Among patients, ACA positivity in the two measurements was higher (12%) than that observed in the control group (5%) (p = 0.36). ACA positivity on two occasions was not a risk factor for new thrombotic events. CONCLUSION: ACA positivity is higher among AMI patients (measured early and at three months) than among the general population although the presence of such antibodies does not increase the risk for new post-infarction thrombotic events.
