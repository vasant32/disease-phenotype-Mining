Ultrasonic duplex scanning was employed to examine cerebral circulation in 50 patients suffering from significant lupus erythematosus (SLE). Of these, 25 patients were with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and 25 were without APS. The patients with APS showed a decrease in the total cerebral circulation and a higher percentage of arterial blood flow asymmetry as compared to the patients without APS. The method expands potentialities of the diagnosis of central nervous system damage associated with SLE.
