 OBJECTIVE: To determine whether low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) plus low-dose aspirin (LDA) is comparable in efficacy and safety to unfractionated heparin (UFH) plus LDA in the management of pregnant women with a history of recurrent spontaneous abortion secondary to antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). METHODS: In a randomized prospective study, 60 women with a history of 3 or more consecutive spontaneous abortions and positive antiphospholipid antibodies were assigned in equal numbers to receive either UFH (5000 units, twice daily) plus LDA, or LMWH (enoxaparin 40 mg, once daily) plus LDA as soon as pregnancy was diagnosed. RESULTS: Twenty-four women in the LMWH group (80%) and 20 women in the UFH group (66.67%) delivered a viable infant (P = 0.243). There were no significant differences in pregnancy complications or neonatal morbidity between the 2 groups. There were no incidences of excessive bleeding, thrombocytopenia, or osteoporotic fractures in either group. CONCLUSION: LMWH plus LDA was successfully used as an alternative to UFH plus LDA in the management of recurrent abortion secondary to APS. The results highlight the need for a larger randomized controlled trial to determine whether LMWH plus LDA should be the treatment of choice for recurrent abortion secondary to APS.
