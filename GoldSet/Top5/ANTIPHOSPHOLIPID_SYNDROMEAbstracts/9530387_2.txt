PURPOSE: Our aim was to determine the thoracic manifestations of patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs). METHOD: We performed a retrospective review of the clinical records and thoracic imaging studies of 88 patients (63 women, 25 men; mean age 47 years) with APAs to determine the spectrum of thoracic disease. RESULTS: Nine patients (10%) had thoracic abnormalities, including eight with pulmonary embolism (PE) and one with aortic thrombus. One patient with PE had subclavian vein thrombosis. Coexistent thromboses included deep venous thrombosis of the leg in six patients. CONCLUSION: PE was the most common thoracic abnormality in our patients. The presence of these antibodies should be suspected in patients with PE of otherwise unexplained etiology.
