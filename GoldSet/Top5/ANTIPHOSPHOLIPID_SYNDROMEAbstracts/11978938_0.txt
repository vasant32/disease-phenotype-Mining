We report a case of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) which presented with clinical and laboratory signs of an autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA), in the absence of manifestations typically related to APS. The diagnosis of APS was made only after the occurrence of a sudden severe heart failure due to an intraventricular thrombus requiring a surgical approach. An accurate thrombophilic screening is warranted also in patients with apparently idiopathic AHA.
