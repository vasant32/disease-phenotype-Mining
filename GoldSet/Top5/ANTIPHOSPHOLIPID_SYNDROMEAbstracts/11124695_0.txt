Anti-annexin V (Anx V) antibodies are detected in SLE patients and patients with habitual fetal loss or preeclampsia. Several case reports have indicated that recurrent abortion based on antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) could be successfully treated with immunoadsorption by using dextran sulfate (DS) columns. The purpose of this study is to clarify whether or not anti-Anx V is also adsorbed by DS-bound cellulose beads. Sera from anti-Anx V-positive patients were mixed with DS-bound cellulose beads in vitro, and the titers of anti-Anx V were measured both before and after incubation. The anti-Anx V titers significantly decreased after incubation. The Anx V also bound to bovine serum albumin-conjugated DS immobilized on microtiter plates. The results of the present study lend support to the basic rationale for immunoadsorption therapy using DS columns in the treatment of habitual abortion closely associated with anti-Anx V antibodies.
