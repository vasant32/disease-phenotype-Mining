The Primary Antiphospholipid Protein Syndrome (PAPS) is characterised by venous and/or arterial thromboses and recurrent foetal loss, in the presence of the Lupus Anticoagulant (LA), elevated antibodies to cardiolipin (ACA) or both. This investigation evaluates the relation between the PAPS and Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO). Forty-eight consecutive patients with RVO were screened for ACA and LA. PAPS was present in 16 (33%) of the patients. Our results suggest that testing Antiphospholipid-Protein Antibodies (APA) may be useful in these patients, together with the assessment of other vascular risk factors.
