We describe a patient with SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome who presented with severe headache and fever. Lumbar puncture analyses indicated meningitis. Kingella kingae was isolated from her blood cultures. A large mobile vegetation was seen on her mitral valve. The association between SLE, Libman-Sacks endocarditis and bacterial endocarditis is discussed.
