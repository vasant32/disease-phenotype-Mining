 INTRODUCTION: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL) has been proposed as a symptom of underlying vascular problems. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the genetic and acquired risk factors. METHODS: Ninety-nine patients were tested for the presence of common polymorphisms related to thrombophilia (prothrombin and factor V Leiden) in order to assess genetic risk factors, and several parameters classically associated with vascular disorders (cardiovascular events, brain stroke and antiphospholipid syndrome) were evaluated. Additional assessments of personal and familial history risk factors for vascular disorders were performed in each patient. RESULTS: Thrombophilia studies did not demonstrate statistically relevant differences between the patients and control group. However, lipidemia profile and directed personal and familial histories showed positive trends for SSHL. CONCLUSION: The lack of clear relationships between SSHL and other vascular risk factors suggests multicausality as a predominant disease profile. Although preliminary results point at a vascular involvement in SSHL, a long-term prospective study is necessary to demonstrate that SSHL represents an early vascular symptom.
