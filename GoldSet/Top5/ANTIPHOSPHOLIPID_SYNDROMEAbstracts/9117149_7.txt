We studied anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies (a beta 2GPI) in autoimmune disease patients to evaluate their relationship to clinical findings. Seventy-nine systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients [44 with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL)], 21 with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), eight asymptomatic individuals with aPL and 60 controls were studied. Sixteen SLE patients (14 with aPL and two without aPL) and six with primary APS had a beta 2GPI. A significant relationship was found between a beta 2GPI and aPL (P < 0.01). In SLE, a significant correlation was found between previous thrombosis or thrombocytopenia and a beta 2GPI or a beta 2GPI + aPL, but not between fetal losses and a beta 2GPI. These data suggest that a beta 2GPI may be useful in the study of APS.
