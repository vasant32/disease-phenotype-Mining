Cerebral thrombotic microangiopathy was found at autopsy in one of two sisters with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, whereas the other revealed increased serum levels of anticardiolipin IgG antibodies (measured only in the living sister); both typical features of systemic lupus erythematosus. These findings add support to the suggestion that Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus are closely related disorders in which dysregulated production of interferon-alpha might play a crucial role.
