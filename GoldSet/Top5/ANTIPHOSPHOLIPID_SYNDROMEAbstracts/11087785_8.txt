A 15-year-old girl with features of Henoch-Schönlein purpura and brain infarct had a transient IgA antiphosphatidylethanolamine antibody (aPE) in her serum and CSF that disappeared 5 months after presentation. Serum aPE is known to be associated with thrombotic events. The authors found no aPE in the CSF of two control individuals or in the serum of two patients with active Henoch-Schönlein purpura without neurologic involvement. The patient may represent a variant of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
