 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the reproductive performance of non-pregnant women with recurrent spontaneous miscarriage (RSM) and the association between RSM and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in reproductive failure. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty non-pregnant women with 3 or more consecutive RSM attending our RSM clinic were evaluated prospectively. Detailed history and physical examination were completed. Extensive laboratory investigations, ultrasonographic, radiological and specialized procedures/tests were performed. Those patients who did not achieve pregnancy within the first 6 months of follow-up had appropriate treatment options implemented. The outcome of any subsequent pregnancies was analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 33.8 +/- 4.6 years (range 22-43 years). The aetiological factors associated with RSM were chromosome anomaly, uterine abnormality, antiphospholipid syndrome, PCOS and infections; 40% were 'unexplained'. Thirty patients (60%) were able to achieve viable pregnancies which progressed to term, resulting in live births. Fourteen of the other 20 patients had high body mass index (BMI) >30 and evidence of PCOS. Of these 20 patients, 13 eventually achieved pregnancies which ended again in first-second-trimester abortions (cause undetermined). The remaining 7 patients (4 with high BMI) who had a combination of male factor/protracted PCOS/ovarian failure did not achieve pregnancies. CONCLUSION: The association of RSM with PCOS resulted in poor reproductive performance, which may progress to reproductive failure.
