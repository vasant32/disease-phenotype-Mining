Autoimmune hepatitis is rarely described in combination with antiphospholipid syndrome. So far, only cases have been presented where the secondary antiphospholipid syndrome occurred as an effect of autoimmune hepatitis. We report on a 56-year-old Caucasian female with a history of thrombosis, thrombocytopenia and the detection of anti-cardiolipin antibodies. Interestingly, a few years later the patient developed liver failure with highly elevated liver enzymes. The immunological antibody pattern verified the diagnosis of type I autoimmune hepatitis, and immunosuppressive therapy led to the recovery of the patient. Thus, we present the first case of autoimmune hepatitis as a consequence of primary antiphospholipid syndrome.
