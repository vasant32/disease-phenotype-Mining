To evaluate spontaneous development of the ocular fundus abnormalities associated with collagen disease, we investigated the ocular fundus lesions in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) models. (NZW x BXSB) F1 mice were employed as SLE models with antiphospholipid syndrome. The abnormal findings in the ocular fundus were recorded with a fundus camera for small animals (KOWA Co., Ltd.), and the chorioretinal lesions were studied histopathologically. As in the systemic symptoms of SLE, the incidence of ocular fundus abnormalities in these (NZW x BXSB) F1 mice was significantly higher in males than in females, suggesting the influence of the Yaa (Y chromosome-linked autoimmune acceleration) gene. Lesions in the fundus appeared in the form of white spots, which increased in number along with the course of the disease. The lesion developed into retinal detachment in some animals. Dilatation of veins and narrowing of arteries were marked. These lesions were very similar to multifocal posterior pigment epitheliopathy (MPPE) in humans in that white spots appear first and then develop into exudative retinal detachment caused by retinal pigment epithelial disorder. Histopathological findings included 1. structural destruction of the photoreceptor cell layer, 2. degeneration and loss of the retinal pigment epithelium, and 3. narrowing and occlusion of the choriocapillaris associated with thrombus formation, cellular infiltration into the surrounding tissues, and wall thickening of the choroidal arterioles. The study of these SLE mouse may contribute to the elucidation of abnormalities in the fundus associated with collagen diseases, including the relationship between thrombus formation and antiphospholipid syndrome.
