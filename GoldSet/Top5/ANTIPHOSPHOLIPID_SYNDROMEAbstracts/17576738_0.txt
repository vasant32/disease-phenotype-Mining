Primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is associated with arterial and venous thrombosis. However, a small number of patients present with visceral aneurysms. Although such aneurysms are rare, their presence in patients who are usually treated with lifelong anticoagulation raises important therapeutic problems, in view of the risk of aneurysm rupture and acute abdominal hemorrhage. We report the case of a young woman with APS who presented with abdominal bleeding due to ruptured common hepatic artery aneurysm. She was successfully treated by proximal ligation. The features of such aneurysms are discussed.
