OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between antiprothrombin (aPT) and antiannexin V (aANX) autoantibodies of IgG isotype and thrombosis in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. To compare the clinical relevance of these antibodies to that of anticardiolipin (aCL), anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies (anti-beta2-GPI), and lupus anticoagulant (LAC). METHODS: Serum IgG aPT, aANX, aCL, and anti-beta2-GPI levels were measured by solid phase enzyme immunoassay in the sera of 70 patients with systemic autoimmune diseases, 35 with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and 35 without APS. Medical records were analyzed, and associations of the antibodies with clinical features of APS were assessed. RESULTS: Patients with APS had higher frequency of aPT (p = 0.001) and aANX (p = 0.002) compared to patients without APS. Thrombotic events occurred more frequently in those with aPT or aANX than those without (p = 0.005, p = 0.006, respectively). The presence of aPT and aANX was found to be highly specific for APS. CONCLUSION: Measurement of aPT and aANX antibodies may be of value in confirming the diagnosis of APS, and in evaluating risk of venous and arterial thrombosis in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases.
