Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS), a thrombophilic condition, is being increasingly recognised as an important cause of recurrent pregnancy loss, preeclampsia and possible infertility. It could occur as a primary condition or it may be secondary to connective tissue diseases, infections or malignancies. Though recurrent pregnancy loss is a common feature ofAPS, there are other presentations attributable to thrombosis. The mechanism of thrombosis is still not completely understood but there are various suggested mechanisms. Presence of anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and lupus anticoagulant (LAC) are diagnostic. Management is variously with heparin, aspirin and warfarin, although other treatment modalities are being deployed. A high index of suspicion is needed for this otherwise treatable condition. Management is ideally best done by an obstetrician and a rheumatologist.
