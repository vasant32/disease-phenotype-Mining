Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is a disorder caused by circulating antibodies reacting with biological membranes and characterized by recurrent thrombosis, chronic thrombocytopenia and miscarriages. It has been reported to occur either as a primary syndrome or secondary to systemic autoimmune disorders. We describe a case of primary APS in a young patient, in whom the clinical course was particularly severe and complicated by a respiratory distress syndrome. The patient was resistant to a number of treatments, and eventually responded to intravenous high dose corticosteroids.
