Morphological manifestations of vasculopathy in antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) include necrosis, vascular thrombosis, proliferation and sclerosis in the absence of inflammation. These changes are generalized. In APLS, productive lymphocytic vasculitides may develop in line with erythematous skin lesions and erythema nodosum. Detection of nuclear pathology and vasculitis in skin biopsies can be considered as diagnostic and prognostic criteria on systemic lupus erythematosus. The above vascular changes are of immunocomplex nature. Cardiolipin antibodies participate in their genesis.
