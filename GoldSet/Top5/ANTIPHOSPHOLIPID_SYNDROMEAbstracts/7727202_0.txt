We studied 11 patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS), basing our diagnosis on Harris's clinical and serological criteria. Analysis of these cases brought to light a number of symptoms that have a statistically significant association with PAPS. Although these symptoms have not yet been recognized internationally as diagnostic criteria, we anticipate that they will be included on a revised and lengthened list of clinical symptoms used for the diagnosis of PAPS. There was a high incidence of neurological symptoms in our case group: disorders were often observed before the onset of full-blown disease and could be confirmed by means of cerebral NMR and SPECT analysis. We believe that further investigation will enable researchers to determine the predictive value of these PAPS-related neurological disorders.
