We present the next case: male, 30 years old, primary APLA syndrome diagnosed after 6 months of treatment with recurrent haemodialysis. The patient, who had a history of vascular thrombosis, presented with thrombotic problems in his arteriovenous fistula made as vascular access for hemodialysis. The discovery of celic trunk and superior mesenteric artery occlusions led us to the clinical diagnosis, which was confirmed by presence of a pathological type of lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies in plasma. We started treatment with oral anticoagulation, warfarin therapy. Since then there have been no more thrombotic events, though the period under observation is still short.
