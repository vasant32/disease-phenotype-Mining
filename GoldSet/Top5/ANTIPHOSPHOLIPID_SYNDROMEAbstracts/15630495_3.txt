The aim of this study was to evaluate the heterogeneity of IgGanti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies (IgG-abeta2GPI) as regarding their reactivity pattern against different sources of human beta2 GPI, their avidity and their association with clinical events of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Three thousand six hundred and eighty-four consecutive patient sera were routinely tested for IgGabeta2 GPI over 1 year using an in-house ELISA with 2 different commercial preparations of human purified beta2GPI. Of the 340 sera found positive, all those clinically documented were included in this study; 61 were positive with only one preparation (S1) and 59 with both (S2). The results of ELISA were confirmed by Western blot. Heterogeneity was stressed by testing sera with a human recombinant protein and 3 beta2GPI-related peptides. No contribution of glycosylation in the binding to beta2GPI was found. The avidity indices for each protein were significantly higher in S1 than in S2 (p=0.0021). S2 were more associated with antiphospholipid antibodies than S1 (75% versus 21% ; p<0.0001). A similar frequency of the main clinical features of APS was found in S1 and S2 sera (69% and 71%, respectively). In conclusion, our data show a heterogeneity in the antigenic reactivity pattern of IgG- abeta2 GPI and a relationship between a binding profile and antibody avidity. This heterogeneity could represent a crucial factor of variability in test results and underlines the difficulty of getting standardisation.
