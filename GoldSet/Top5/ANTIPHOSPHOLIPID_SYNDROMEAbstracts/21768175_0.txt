Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an extremely uncommon condition that can lead to fatal acute myocardial infarction. There have been very few case reports of SCAD in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and even fewer in association with antiphospholipid antibodies - mainly postpartum. This is the first reported case of SCAD in a patient who was confirmed to have SLE and tested positive for anticardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant. This case demonstrates the importance of carefully considering the differential diagnoses of SCAD at presentation. It also highlights the need for further research to explore the link between SLE, antiphospholipid antibodies and SCAD.
