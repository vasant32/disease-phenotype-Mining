We report here, we believe for the first time, the primary antiphospholipid syndrome, presenting with fever, meningismus and skin rash. Serology was positive for antiphospholipid antibodies but negative for antinuclear factor. Such presentations, once meningitis has been excluded, should be screened for antiphospholipid antibodies. If serology proves to be positive, anticoagulation for life should be considered to avoid thrombotic episodes and death due to pulmonary embolism.
