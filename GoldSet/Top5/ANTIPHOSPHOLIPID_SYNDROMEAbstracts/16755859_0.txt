Antiphospholipin syndrome (APLS) is one of the most frequent reasons for arterial and venous thromboses. Primary and secondary APLS can lead to thrombotic process in coronary arteries. The biggest diagnostic difficulties appear in cases of small coronary vasal involvement leading to diffuse myocardial lesion. Perfusion myocardial scintigraphy (MS) allows specification of the character of myocardial changes. Revealing of myocardial changes by means of MS makes it possible to start timely anticoagulative therapy, which significantly improves prognosis and life quality.
