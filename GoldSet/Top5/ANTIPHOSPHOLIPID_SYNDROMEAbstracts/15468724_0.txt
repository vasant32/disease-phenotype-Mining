A prospective study was made of 93 patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), including 34 patients with primary APS (PAPS) and 59 with secondary APS (SAPS) associated with exanthematous lupus erythematosus (ELE). According to the clinical outcomes, PAPS is heterogeneous since the clinical and laboratory signs of ELE or lupus-like syndrome occurred in two thirds of the patients with PAPS. The clinical manifestations of PAPS and ELE-associated SAPS differed at the height of disease: the signs of vascular diseases were prevalent in patients with PAPS and ELE-associated systemic manifestations were predominant in those with SAPS. In the patients with APS who further developed ELE, unlike those with PAPS showed a high incidence of transient erythema and arthralgias. The levels of serological markers in patients with APS at its height did not differ. As compared with healthy individuals, patients with APS were found to have the similar changes in the nonspecific immunological parameters manifested by absolute lymphopenia, by the diminished Fc-phagocytosis of monocytes and neutrophils, by the elevated levels of circulating immune complexes, and by the high biocidal activity of neutrophils. There were no significant differences in the immunity of patients with PAPS and in those with SAPS.
