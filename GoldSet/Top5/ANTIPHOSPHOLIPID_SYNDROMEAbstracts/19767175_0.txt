Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis is a condition characterized by noninfectious valvular vegetations and is associated with numerous conditions, including the antiphospholipid syndrome. Although vegetations most frequently affect the left-sided valves, isolated involvement of the right-sided valves rarely occurs. Ideal management of the lesions, from both medical and surgical perspectives, is not well defined. The authors report the case of a patient who presented with clinically symptomatic isolated tricuspid valve and right atrial nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis due to primary antiphospholipid syndrome, who was subsequently managed with diuretics and anticoagulation and has remained clinically stable.
