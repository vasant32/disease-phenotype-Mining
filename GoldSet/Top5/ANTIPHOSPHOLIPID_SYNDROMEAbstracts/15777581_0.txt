PURPOSE: If there is cardiac valve vegetation and the blood cultures are negatives we need to look for slow growing bacteria, fungi, Legionella pneumophilia, Bartonella henselae and quintana, Brucella melitensis and abortus, Coxiella burneti, Chlamydiae pneumoniae by serologic tests. The diagnosis of non- infectious endocarditis could be considered only if these results were negative. The main purpose of this study was to describe the clinical and echocardiographic signs of non-infectious endocarditis cases observed in two different wards. METHODS: This study was done retrospectively during a five-year period in a cardiology and an internal medicine wards. The selection criteria are: the proof of at least one cardiac valve vegetation, observed on echocardiography, negative blood cultures and negative serologic tests as described above. RESULTS: Six non-bacterial endocarditis were described. Four Libman-Sacks endocarditis, two associated with a primary antiphospholipid syndrome revealed by an acute ischemia of leg for one patient and by an eclampsia for another and the other two associated with a systemic lupus erythematous revealed by fever for one patient and by neurologic symptoms for the other. One fibroblastic endocarditis associated to an essential hypereosinophilia and one marastic endocarditis associated to a metastatic mucin-producing cancer. CONCLUSIONS: For these six cases, a complete physical examination, a CBC for hypereosinophylia, a dosage of antiphospholipid antibodies and a thoraco-abdominal CT-scan allowed the etiologic diagnosis of non infectious endocarditis. Libman Sacks endocarditis associated with an antiphospholipid syndrome is the main etiology for which a long-term anticoagulation treatment was not followed.
