In addition to their role in the thrombotic manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), autoimmune antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies may also be responsible for direct injury to the blood vessel wall, although the mechanism is unclear. Cryoglobulinemia has been reported infrequently in patients with APS and is one potential means of blood vessel injury. The aim of the present study was to determine if autoimmune aPL antibodies and their target antigens contribute to the formation of cryoprecipitates. Cryoglobulins were identified and isolated from 5 of 8 patients with autoimmune aPL antibodies. Using identical concentrations of immunoglobulins isolated from matched sera and washed cryoprecipitates there was a significant enrichment (at least 100%) of aCL antibodies in the cryoprecipitates from 4 of 5 patients. This involved IgG, IgM and IgA isotypes with specificity for both beta2-glycoprotein I (GPI) and prothrombin (PT). The target antigens were detected in cryoprecipitates from all 5 aPL positive patients and in cryoprecipitates from 3 controls. These results suggest that anti-beta2-GPI and anti-PT antibodies in association with their target antigens are integrally involved in the formation of cryoprecipitates in patients with autoimmune aPL antibodies and provide insight into a potential mechanism for blood vessel injury.
