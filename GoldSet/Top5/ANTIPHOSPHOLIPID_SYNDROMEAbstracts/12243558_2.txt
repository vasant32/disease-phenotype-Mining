Two female patients are reported, who presented with Budd-Chiari syndrome (hepatic vein thrombosis), and were found to have both, antiphospholipid antibodies and homozygous factor V Leiden mutation. Both patients also had recurrent fetal losses, as well as splenic and portal vein thrombosis. The coexistence of homozygous factor V Leiden mutation and antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome is extremely rare. The interaction of antiphospholipid antibodies and factor V Leiden mutation in the pathogenesis of antiphospholipid syndrome and their contribution to Budd-Chiari syndrome are discussed.
