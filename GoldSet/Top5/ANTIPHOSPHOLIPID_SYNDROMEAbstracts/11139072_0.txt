Several clinical conditions, such as deep vein thrombosis, cerebral infarct, pulmonary infarct, skin ulcers, renal failure, and habitual abortion, are thought to be associated with the antiphospholipid syndrome. The authors describe a 32-year-old woman who had characteristics of the antiphospholipid syndrome including increased immunoglobulin G-cardiolipin antibody titers, iliofemoral vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, headache, visual disturbances, and habitual abortion. During hospitalization, she suddenly experienced right-sided weakness. A Tc-99m HMPAO brain scan showed the probability of a transient ischemic attack in the left frontotemporal cortex.
