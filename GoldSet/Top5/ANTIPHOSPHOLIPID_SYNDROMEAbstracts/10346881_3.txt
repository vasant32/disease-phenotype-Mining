Antibodies which bind beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) are associated with antiphospholipid syndrome. Synthetic peptide mimotopes have been discovered which compete with beta2GPI for binding to selected anti-beta2GPI. A thiol-containing linker was attached to the N-terminus of two cyclic thioether peptide mimotopes, peptides 1a and 1b. The resulting peptides, with linker attached, were reacted with two different haloacetylated platforms to prepare four tetravalent peptide-platform conjugates to be tested as B cell toleragens. The linker-containing peptides were reacted with maleimide-derivatized keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) to provide peptide-KLH conjugates. Peptides 1a and 1b were also modified by acylation with 3-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester. The resulting hydroxyphenyl peptides were radioiodinated and used to measure anti-peptide antibody levels. The KLH conjugates were used to immunize mice to generate an anti-peptide immune response. The immunized mice were treated with the conjugates or saline solution and boosted with the appropriate peptide-KLH conjugate. Three of the four conjugates suppressed the formation of anti-peptide antibody. The stabilities of the conjugates in mouse serum were measured, and the relative stabilities did not correlate with ability to suppress antibody formation.
