AIM: To study beta2-GP-I-dependent binding of phospholipid antibodies (PAb) to phospholipids and this process participation in pathogenesis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: IgG-fractions and sera from 20 patients with APS. Cofactor activity of beta2-GP-I isolated from serum of healthy donors was examined with modified immunoassay. RESULTS: Contrary to donor IgG, binding of IgG fractions isolated from sera of APS patients with cardiolipin grows dose-dependently in the presence of beta2-GP-I. Cofactor activity of beta2-GP-I is confirmed in the study of sera of APS patients. Sera containing beta2-GP-I-dependent antibodies to cardiolipin (aCL), unlike aCL-negative sera, react with solid-phase immobilized beta2-GP-I. CONCLUSION: It is confirmed that beta2-GP-I participates in interaction of PAb with cardiolipin. Pathogenetic implication of beta2-GP-I-dependent PAb for onset of APS is discussed.
