A 43-year old male patient with hyponatremic hypertensive syndrome was diagnosed as catastrophic primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS). He subsequently developed hepatosplenomegaly. The patient also carried thrombophilia- and haemochromatosis-associated gene mutations. Further investigations upon persistence of splenomegaly indicated development of idiopathic portal hypertension.
