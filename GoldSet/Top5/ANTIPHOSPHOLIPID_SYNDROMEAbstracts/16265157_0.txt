 BACKGROUND: A 35-year-old woman with a past history of antiphospholipid syndrome and near-fatal vascular thrombosis was transferred to Glasgow Royal Infirmary, UK, for investigation of 'obscure' gastrointestinal bleeding in the context of long-term oral anticoagulation therapy. Initial endoscopic examination revealed isolated gastric varices with stigmata of recent hemorrhage. She had no prior history of liver disease or portal hypertension. Investigations to ascertain the cause of her varices were performed. INVESTIGATIONS: CT venography, endoscopic ultrasound and transjugular liver biopsy. DIAGNOSIS: Nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver leading to gastric varices. MANAGEMENT: Endoscopic histacryl tissue-glue injection followed by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and long-term oral anticoagulation therapy.
