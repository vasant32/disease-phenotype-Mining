Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by venous and arterial thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, stroke and, rarely, acute coronary syndromes. However, there are no data available regarding the management of acute myocardial infarction in primary antiphospholipid syndrome with accompanying severe thrombocytopenia and cardiogenic shock. We describe such a case, which was managed by successful primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent implantation with accompanying immunosuppression therapy.
