In the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), antibodies to a complex of phospholipids and beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2-GPI) are associated with recurrent thromboembolic events, spontaneous abortions, thrombocytopenia and central nervous system (CNS) disturbances. Animals immunized with beta2-GPI develop the systemic manifestations of APS but the involvement of the (CNS) in these animals has not been studied. The objective of the present study was to examine mice with induced experimental APS for behavioral changes. Female Balb/C mice were immunized once with beta2-GPI in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or with CFA alone. Four months after immunization the mice were tested in the staircase apparatus and the following two variables were measured: (1) number of rears: and (2) number of stairs climbed by the mice. Immunization with beta2-GPI resulted in elevated levels of circulating anti-negatively charged phospholipids and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies. The APS mice exhibited hyperactive behavior as reflected by more frequent rears (P < 0.023) and higher number of stairs climbed (P < 0.019) by the mice in 3 min. This simple test demonstrated that experimental APS animals are significantly hyperactive and may serve as a marker for CNS involvement in this model.
