The cause of thrombosis in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is unknown. There have been reports of abnormalities in the antigenic levels or activity of endothelium-derived haemostatic factors, such as tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1); however the data from these studies are conflicting. We studied plasma from nine patients with APS; seven of them had a history of thrombosis, and three had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We also studied nine matched control patients who had SLE without APS, and 14 healthy individuals. We measured t-PA, von Willebrand factor (vWF), anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) and anti-endothelial cell antibody (AECA) levels by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), PAI-1 activity by a parabolic-rate chromogenic assay, and lupus anticoagulant (LA) activity by a standard mixing test. For t-PA and PAI-1, measurements were made on morning and evening plasma samples. The two groups of patients did not differ significantly with respect to age, sex, plasma lipids or anti-inflammatory drugs. Most APS patients (7/9) but none of the controls were taking warfarin. Between the APS and the control patients no significant differences were detected in t-PA, PAI-1, vWF or AECA levels. When APS patients were considered alone, vWF levels correlated positively with IgG ACA levels (r = 0.81, P < 0.01) and negatively with platelet count (r = -0.68, P < 0.05). There was no correlation between levels of ACA or LA activity and t-PA, PAI-1 or AECA. Compared with healthy volunteers, the diurnal variation of t-PA and PAI-1 was blunted in the two patient groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
