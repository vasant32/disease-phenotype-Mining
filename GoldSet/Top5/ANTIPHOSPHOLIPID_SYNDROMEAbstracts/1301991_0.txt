We examined the prevalence of the antibodies to cardiolipin measured by solid-phase enzyme immunoassay during a prospective study of patients with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE). Seven of 44 (16%) consecutive patients with SCLE had positive anticardiolipin antibodies; of these only three satisfied the American Rheumatism Association's revised criteria for the classification of systemic lupus erythematosus. Clinical findings probably associated with the positive anticardiolipin antibodies were found in four cases, including clotting abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, livedo reticularis, chilblain lupus erythematosus lesions, migraine, leg venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after surgery, and spontaneous abortion. Our data suggest that it is reasonable to screen SCLE patients for these antibodies to confirm the presence of the antiphospholipid syndrome.
