The significance of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACAs) prior to renal transplantation is unclear. We studied a cohort of 337 patients who underwent renal transplantation from 1996 to 2001. Follow-up continued until allograft loss, patient death or 31 December 2002. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of death-censored allograft loss or a 25% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 1-month post-transplant. Secondary outcomes were allograft loss, a 25% reduction in GFR, acute rejection and creatinine at 1 year. IgG and IgM ACA titers were positive (> or =15) in 18.1% of recipients. There were no significant differences at baseline between recipients, except coumadin therapy in those with positive ACA titers (20% vs. 7.4%). Post-transplant, there was no increase in the primary outcome in ACA-positive patients, even after adjustment for anticoagulation with coumadin (HR = 1.42 [0.68, 2.96]). There was no difference in secondary outcomes between those with or without positive titers. Two of five patients with very high titers (>50) who were not anticoagulated had early graft loss. A positive ACA titer prior to kidney transplantation was not associated with inferior renal outcomes after transplantation, although more research is required to address the prognostic significance of very high ACA titers.
