Of the systemic autoimmune diseases that lead to sterility/infertility, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) has an outstanding importance; it may be associated with abortion and premature birth which are included in its diagnostic criteria, as well as preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, foetal retardation, miscarriage, stillbirth and sterility. Between 2004 and 2009, on the Department of Immunology in the Zala County Hospital, 100 female patients with sterility (st)/infertility (if) (33/67), (mean age: 34.08 years) underwent, in addition to history taking and physical examination, an assessment by immune-serologic tests (ANA, anti-dsDNA, ENA-Profile, anti-TPO, a-sperm, aCL, aPS, aβ2GP1, aANX, and aPT). Positive aCL on two occasions could be demonstrated in 27/100 cases (27%) (st/if: 7/20). Among them 4 cases of primary APS have been diagnosed respectively. In the remaining 17 patients the clinical picture did not fulfil criteria. In addition to the twofold positive aCL, unusual antiphospholipid antibodies including aβ2GP1, aPS or both were present in 1/27, 2/27 and 1/27 patients, as well as aANX and aPT in 3/26 and 1/27 patients respectively. One-time positive aCL occurred in 16/100 women (16%) (st/if: 5/11); among them aPT and aβ2GP1 could be detected in 1/16 patient each. Based on the clinical picture, we raised the possibility of primary APS in 2/16 patients. Among the aCL-negative women, we found the unusual antibodies of APS in 8/57 patients (14%) including positivity of aβ2GP1, aPS, aPT and aANX in 4/57, 4/57, 2/57 and 3/57 patients respectively; taking the clinical criteria of APS into consideration, primary APS could be stated in 2/57 patients of them. The 32 pregnancies developed in the follow-up period upon administration of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and maintenance dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), together with prednisolone in patients with secondary APS, resulted in 23 deliveries and 5 miscarriages; 4 pregnancies are currently in progress. The results of our investigations highlight the significance of demonstrating latent autoimmune diseases in female patients with sterility/infertility, as barrenness can be terminated by the appropriate treatment of these conditions.
