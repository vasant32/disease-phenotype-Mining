This report considers the rare situation in which primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) is linked with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). It describes the case of a young lady with PAPS, characterized by recurring cerebro-vascular abnormalities and marked livedo reticularis, combined with circulating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant antibodies. On follow-up, while on oral anticoagulation, she developed severe thrombocytopenia associated with hematuria, microangiophatic anaemia and neurological manifestations consistent with a diagnosis of TTP. The patient was treated with pulses of methylprednisolone and plasmapheresis with plasma exchange. The result was a favourable outcome. To our knowledge, this is the seventh report on this rare association in the English-language literature of this field.
