The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is defined by the presence of thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity in combination with the persistent presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies and/or anti-Î²2-glycoprotein I antibodies in medium to high titers. The management of thrombosis in patients with APS is a subject of controversy. This set of recommendations is the result of an effort to produce guidelines for therapy within a group of specialist physicians in Cardiology, Neurology, Hematology, Rheumatology and Internal Medicine, with a clinical and research focus on APS.
