A 36-year-old woman suffered from steroid-responsive relapsing myelitis associated with hypocomplementemia, thrombocytopenia, and anti-cardiolipin antibody. At the second attack of paraplegia, neck flexion in a supine position induced uncomfortable dysesthesia radiating into the ulnar side of the bilateral forearms. Both truncal and neck flexion resulted in painful dysesthesia down into both lower limbs also. Cervical MRI showed 2 gadolinium-enhanced dorsal-dominant lesions in the spinal cord at C 5/6 and C 6/7 disc levels. Enhancement of Lhermitte sign by truncal flexion might be useful to detect multiple lesions in the dorsal column.
