A reduction in fibrinolysis has been described in association with thrombosis in the primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS). In this study, we measured anti-tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antibodies and anti-fibrin-bound t-PA antibodies as possible causes of hypofibrinolysis in 39 patients with PAPS. We also evaluated the differences in anti t-PA antibodies between patients without previous thrombosis (20 patients) and patients with previous episodes of thrombosis (19 patients: deep vein thrombosis in nine, ischaemic stroke in six, arterial leg thrombosis in one, hepatic vein thrombosis in one, thrombophlebitis in one and cerebral venous thrombosis in one). Anti-t-PA antibodies were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and anti-t-PA fibrin-bound antibodies were measured by a solid-phase fibrin immunoassay (SOFIA) in 39 patients with PAPS and in 39 controls matched for gender and age. High levels of IgG anti-t-PA were found in three out of 39 patients with PAPS, and all three patients had a history of thrombosis; four other patients, one of whom had a history of thrombotic events, had high titres of antibodies directed against fibrin-bound t-PA. In addition, patients with ischaemic stroke had significantly higher levels of IgG anti-t-PA than patients without thrombosis (P = 0.029). In conclusion, our data showed that, in patients with PAPS, the highest levels of anti-t-PA antibodies were present in subjects with previous thrombotic events. The discrepancy in the results obtained with two methods of detection of anti-t-PA antibodies, ELISA and SOFIA, indicates a different interaction of the antibodies with the t-PA molecules, which are directly bound to polystyrene plates in ELISA and bound to fibrin as a bridging molecule in SOFIA.
