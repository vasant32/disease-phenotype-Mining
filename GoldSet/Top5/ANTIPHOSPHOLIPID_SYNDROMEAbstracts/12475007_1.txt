We report the case of a 72-year-old female with sarcoidosis who developed a central retinal artery occlusion in her left eye in association with persistently high titers of IgG anti-cardiolipin antibodies. Only two previous cases of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in association with sarcoidosis have been reported. Our patient's vision stabilized on anti-coagulant therapy along with concomitant treatment of sarcoidosis-related uveitis with methotrexate.
