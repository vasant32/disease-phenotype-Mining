We report a 27-year-old primigravida with systemic lupus erythematosus, erythema multiforme-like lesions and a peculiar immunological pattern consisting of antinuclear antibody (speckled pattern) and rheumatoid factor, an association known as Rowell's syndrome. She also had a probable antiphospholipid syndrome as evidenced by the presence of a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, kaolin clotting time and thrombocytopenia.
