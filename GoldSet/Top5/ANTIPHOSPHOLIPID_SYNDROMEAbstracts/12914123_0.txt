Two rheumatoid arthritis patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome were observed. The diagnosis was established by the clinical signs and the measurement of anticardiolipin antibodies. As a result of the genetic investigations, typical HLA markers of the rheumatoid arthritis and those of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome were found in both patients. In connection with rheumatoid arthritis they were the HLA-DRB1*0101 allele in the female and the HLA-DRB1*0401 in the male patient. With regards to antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, the HLA alleles were the HLA DQB1*0602 in both patients and the HLA DQB1*0302 in the male patient.
