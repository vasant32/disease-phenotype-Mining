The study was undertaken to evaluate clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with lupus enteritis and to investigate its association with anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECAs). Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients who were admitted to Kangnam St. Mary's Hospital with complaints of acute abdominal pain from January 1990 to July 2006 were reviewed retrospectively. The clinical features, laboratory data and prognosis of these patients were analyzed. Among the 706 SLE patients admitted during the study period, 87 were found to admit for acute abdominal pain. Among them, 41 patients were identified with lupus enteritis. The SLE disease activity index score at admission and the mean prednisolone dose administered during the last three months prior to admission were significantly higher in patients with lupus enteritis than those with other causes (P < 0.001, P = 0.036). Serum anti-endothelial cell antibody (AECA-IgG) titer was also significantly higher in patients with lupus enteritis than those with other manifestations or healthy controls (P = 0.040, P < 0.001). Four out of 13 recurrent patients had pre-existing anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS), whereas only one out of 28 non-recurrent patients had pre-existing APS (P = 0.028). Most of the patients with lupus enteritis showed good response to high-dose intravenous steroids and there was no death directly associated with lupus enteritis.
