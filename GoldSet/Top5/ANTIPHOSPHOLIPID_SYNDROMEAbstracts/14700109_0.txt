PURPOSE: To report hypo-estrogenemic state in a case of recurrent vitreous hemorrhages due to primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. METHODS: Interventional case report. A 40-year-old woman presented with recurrent vitreous hemorrhages. Treated initially with laser photocoagulation followed by hormone replacement therapy. RESULTS: Cessation of vitreous hemorrhage since starting hormone replacement therapy (twenty months ago). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first documented case of hypo-estrogenemia in lupus anticoagulant retinopathy. The response of this condition to estrogen is worth exploring.
