Ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction in patients with SLE--are usually secondary to early coronary atherosclerosis. Estimation if antiphospholipid syndrome and antiphospholipid antibodies are the risk factor for myocardial infarction and ischemic heart disease in patients with TRU. We examined 129 patients with SLE (114 women and 15 men). All the patients underwent comprehensive physical examination. ECG, ultrasound heart examinations were performed. They were followed by heart scintygraphic examination if indicated. Routine biochemical and hematological laboratory tests were performed including fasting glucose level, concentration of homocysteine, uric acid and lipids. Wide range of immunological essays were performed, testing for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (ENA), antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin antibodies--aCL, lupus anticoagulant--LA, antiprothrombine antibodies aPT, anti-beta2glicoprotein-I antibodies), anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-nucleosome antibodies, antihistone antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and antiendothelial antibodies (AECA). Statistical analysis was performed with chi2 Yates, chi2 Pearson and R rang Spearman tests. Multivariate regression analysis was also done. Ischemic heart disease was found in 20 (15.5%) SLE patients, myocardial infarctions were diagnosed in 9 (6.97%). Ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction were significantly related to presence of secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (SAPS), OR: 4.21, p = 0.008 and OR: 12.8; p = 0.02 respectively). They were also related to high activity of SLE, OR: 7.18; p = 0.012 and OR: 27.3; p = 0.006 respectively. Ischemic heart disease was significantly more common in older patients (52.75 years versus 42.15 years; p = 0.0008) and in patients with hypertension (p < 0.05). Impaired glucose tolerance (OR: 8.44; p = 0.03), presence of aCL IgG (OR; 2.93; p = 0.05) and p-ANCA anti-MPO (OR: 6.08; p = 0.036) were found to be risk factors of ischemic heart disease. Myocardial infarction was significantly associated with high uric acid level (OR: 5.01; p = 0.052) and impaired glucose tolerance (OR: 7.42; p = 0.047) and with presence of the following antibodies: aCL IgG and/or aCL IgM (OR: 5.61; p = 0.039), ANCA in the indirect immunofluorescence essay (OR: 5.78; p = 0.035), anti-MPO antibodies (OR: 6.58; p = 0.051) and AECA (OR: 11.10; p = 0.026). Presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and SAPS are significant risk factors of ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction in SLE patients. The risk factors of ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction in SLE patients significantly differ from the ones in general population.
