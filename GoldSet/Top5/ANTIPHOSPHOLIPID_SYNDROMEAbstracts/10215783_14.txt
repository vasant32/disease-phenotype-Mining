Livedoid vasculitis, otherwise known as segmental hyalinizing vasculitis or livedo reticularis with summer ulceration, is a chronic disease with lesions affecting the feet and lower legs. Early lesions show petechiae, but characteristic features are recurrent, bizarrely shaped ulcers that heal to leave hyperpigmentation and atrophie blanche. The aetiology of the disorder is unknown, but the histology shows fibrin deposition within both the wall and lumen of affected vessels. The absence of a sufficient perivascular infiltrate or leucocytoclasia argues against a vasculitis, being more in keeping with a thrombo-occlusive process. Four patients with livedoid vasculitis with ulceration are described, all of whom had associated raised anticardiolipin antibodies but no other evidence of systemic disease. We suggest that livedoid vasculitis may be a manifestation of the antiphospholipid syndrome and recommend that all patients are screened for this. We also discuss treatment options for this often resistant condition.
