OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the use of low-dose aspirin alone with heparin and low-dose aspirin in the treatment of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, single-center trial included 50 patients who were alternately assigned to treatment. Each patient had at least three consecutive spontaneous pregnancy losses, positive antiphospholipid antibodies on two occasions, and a complete evaluation. Data were compared by chi(2) analysis and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Viable infants were delivered of 11 of 25 (44%) women treated with aspirin and 20 of 25 (80%) women treated with heparin and aspirin (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the low-dose aspirin and the heparin plus low-dose aspirin groups with respect to gestational age at delivery (37.8 +/- 2.1 vs 37.2 +/- 3.4 weeks), number of cesarean sections (18% vs 20%), or complications. CONCLUSION: Heparin plus low-dose aspirin provides a significantly better pregnancy outcome than low-dose aspirin alone does for antiphospholipid antibody-associated recurrent pregnancy loss.
