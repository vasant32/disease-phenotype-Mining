PROBLEM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of two different prophylactic protocols, low-dose aspirin and fish oil derivates, in the treatment of patients with recurrent pregnancy loss associated with antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) syndrome. METHODS: A prospective study included 30 patients who were alternately assigned to treatment. Each patient had had at least two consecutive spontaneous abortions, positive antiphospholipid antibodies on two occasions, and a complete evaluation. RESULTS: Among patients treated with low-dose aspirin, 12 out of the 15 (80%) pregnancies ended in live births. In the fish oil derivate group 11 out of the 15 (73.3%) ended in live births (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences between the low-dose aspirin and the fish oil derivates groups with respect to gestational age at delivery (39.9 +/- 0.4 vs 39 +/- 1.5 weeks), fetal birth weight (3290 +/- 200g vs 3560 +/- 100 g), number of cesarean sections (25% vs 18%), or complications. CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in terms of pregnancy outcome between women with recurrent pregnancy loss associated with APA syndrome treated with low-dose aspirin or fish oil derivates.
