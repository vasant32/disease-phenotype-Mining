AIM: To evaluate clinical implications of measurements of the level of soluble cell molecules of adhesion (sCMA) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and primary APS (PAPS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Serum levels of sP-selectine, sE-selectine, sVCAM-1 were determined with enzyme immunoassay (R&D, USA) in 23 SLE with APS, 15 SLE patients free of APS and 19 patients with PAPS. RESULTS: Mean levels of sE-selectine and sVCAM-1 in SLE patients with APS, PAPS and SLE was higher than in donors. Elevated mean levels of sP-selectine were observed only in SLE patients free of APS. These patients also showed a correlation between sVCAM-1 level and the disease activity (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The development of immunopathological process in APS is associated with increased concentration of sCMA.
