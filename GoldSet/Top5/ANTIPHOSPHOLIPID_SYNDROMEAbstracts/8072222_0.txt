To investigate some of the problems associated with pregnancy and delivery in lupus nephritis, 13 pregnancies in 7 patients with inactive lupus nephritis and 5 pregnancies in one patient with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) were compared with 36 pregnancies in 22 patients with primary nephrotic syndrome (NS). Furthermore, a follow-up survey during 0-8 years was made with 12 babies born to mothers with lupus nephritis. Some pregnancies during lupus nephritis were accompanied by disease exacerbation and worsening of renal function. There was a higher incidence of babies born with a low birth weight, and the incidences of fetal loss or premature birth and toxemia were higher in lupus nephritis than in NS. The number of babies with a low birth weight was significantly higher in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension or skin lesion due to lupus erythematosus. The presence of antibodies against SSA/RO in the mother was associated with the occurrence of congenital heart block. Birth weight of babies born to mothers with lupus nephritis was low, but there were no statistical differences in the growth of babies after 6 months of age compared with babies born to normal women.
