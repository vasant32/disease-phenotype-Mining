The primary antiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder which is characterized by: arterial and/or venous thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, recurrent fetal loss and high plasma levels of antiphospholipid antibodies. Valvular involvement is associated with arterial thrombosis and the most frequent manifestation is regurgitation. We report the case of a young male with primary antiphospholipid syndrome and previous cerebrovascular thrombosis hospitalized for subacute myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography revealed right and left anterior descendent coronary artery stenosis, the latter being successfully recanalized by direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated aortic valve involvement with predominant regurgitation and transesophageal echocardiography detected valve excrescences on the aortic leaflets. Laboratory study demonstrated thrombocytopenia, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and high titers of anticardiolipin antibodies. Oral anticoagulation therapy was started. Thrombotic events have not recurred after three months of follow-up.
