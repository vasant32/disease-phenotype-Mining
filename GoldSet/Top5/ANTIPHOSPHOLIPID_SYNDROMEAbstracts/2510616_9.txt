A group of seven young women with antiphospholipid antibodies, histories of recurrent fetal loss, and no live births is reported. Two patients had systemic lupus erythematosus, and the other five fulfilled criteria for the primary antiphospholipid syndrome. A false Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test was present in four of the patients, three had a previous episode of arterial or venous thrombosis, or both, and two had thrombocytopenia. Prednisone and acetylsalicylic acid were given, and monthly controls of lupus anticoagulant activity were carried out. The dose of acetylsalicylic acid was fixed while the dose of steroids was adjusted according to the degree of lupus anticoagulant activity. A fetal survival was obtained in 7/9 (78%) of the pregnancies. Three of the newborn infants had transitory lupus anticoagulant activity. A search for antiphospholipid antibodies should be carried out in patients with otherwise unexplained fetal losses, falsely positive VDRL tests, thrombosis, or thrombocytopenia as the treatment of such patients with prednisone and acetylsalicylic acid is highly effective.
