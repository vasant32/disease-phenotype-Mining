An analysis was made of clinical complications, determined with objective methods, in 68 patients at the University Clinic of Navarra with the clinical suspicion of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and presence of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA). Patients with IgG higher than 23 GPL were considered for the study. The most prevalent pathology was thrombosis: venous thrombosis (42.6%) and arterial thrombosis (22%). Other complications were abortions (23.8% of the 42 women) and thrombocytopenia (12.1%). With respect to the localisation of venous thrombosis, predominance corresponded to lower extremities (51.7%), followed by superficial thrombophlebitis (27.5%) and pulmonary thromboembolism (20.6%). Among the arterial complications, the most frequent were cerebrovascular disease (86.6 %) and coronary disease (13.4%). There was no correlation between the presence of high values of ACA and the prevalence or severity of clinical manifestations. In the series of patients with ACA IgG>23 GPL, we appreciated a high percentage of venous and arterial thrombosis detected with objective methods. The presence of ACA constitutes a prothrombotic risk factor
