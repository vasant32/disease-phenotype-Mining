A 23-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of painful ulcerations and retiform scarring of his lower extremities. Skin biopsy revealed evidence of thrombotic vasculopathy. Livedoid vasculopathy is an uncommon condition presenting as painful lower extremity ulceration and scarring in the form of irregular, ivory-white, stellate plaques. Its pathogenesis is unclear, but it is thought to result from coagulation and fibrinolytic disorders causing occlusion of dermal vessels.
