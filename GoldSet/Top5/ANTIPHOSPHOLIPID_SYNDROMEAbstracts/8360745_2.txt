Antiphospholipid antibodies have been reported to occur in ischemic stroke patients, but there have been no previous reports linking these antibodies to spinal cord infarction. A case of spinal cord infarction associated with primary antiphospholipid syndrome in a 6-year-old boy is reported. Magnetic resonance imaging clearly demonstrated marked swelling of the thoracolumbar spinal cord with gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid enhancement at an acute stage, followed later by cord atrophy. Serological study disclosed positive lupus anticoagulant and immunoglobulin G anticardiolipin antibody. It is suggested that the role of antiphospholipid antibodies as an etiological factor for spinal cord ischemia should be recognized among causes that might have been categorized as either spontaneous spinal cord infarction or myelitis.
