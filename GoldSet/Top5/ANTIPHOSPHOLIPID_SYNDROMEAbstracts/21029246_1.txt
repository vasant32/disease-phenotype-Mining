 PROBLEM: The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by vascular thrombosis and/or pregnancy complications (lower fecundity and lower litter size), as well as by an increase in anti-β(2) glycoprotein I (β(2) GPI)-specific autoantibody titer. We have investigated how the genetic background of the immune system [T helper (Th) prevalence] and the type of animal model of APS influence the induced pathology. METHOD OF STUDY: Antiphospholipid syndrome induced by tetanus toxoid (TTd) hyper-immunization and by intravenous application of monoclonal anti-β(2) GPI-specific antibody 26 was compared in C57BL/6 (Th1 prone) and BALB/c (Th2 prone) mice. RESULTS: Tetanus toxoid hyper-immunization of BALB/c mice led to reduction in fertility, but in C57BL/6 mice a decrease in fecundity occurred. In both cases, pathology was caused by anti-β(2) GPI antibodies, the production of which was adjuvant and strain dependent. CONCLUSION: We conclude that TTd immunization and i.v. application of monoclonal antibody 26 induced the same reproductive pathology and that the type of pathology is strain dependent.
