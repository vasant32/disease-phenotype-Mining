BACKGROUND: Graft thrombosis is one of the main reasons of graft loss following simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPK). Although antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) is known as a high risk for graft thrombosis in kidney transplants alone, little is known about APLS in SPK. METHODS: Between September 2000 and December 2001, 45 SPK were performed. The treatment and clinical course of 2 patients with APLS is presented. RESULTS: In one patient, APLS was known before transplantation. After SPK, she was treated by systemic heparin followed by coumarin. Both grafts are doing well 5 months posttransplant. The second patient underwent SPK without knowledge of APLS. The patient developed a deep vein thrombosis 5 weeks posttransplant. Hypercoagulability screening revealed APLS. Treatment consisted of systemic anticoagulation. Grafts were not affected. CONCLUSION: SPK can successfully be performed in APLS patients if anticoagulation is performed consistently. To reduce the risk of graft thrombosis, a pretransplant screening for APLS would probably be of benefit.
