A 15-year-old boy who was admitted to the neurology department had multiple cerebral infarcts on cranial magnetic resonance imaging. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed myocardial thickening and apical thrombus in the left ventricle suggesting Loeffler endocarditis. There was remarkable hypereosinophilia on the haemogram. An investigation for the aetiology of hypereosinophilia led to the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus and associated antiphospholipid syndrome. This case represents a very rare case of systemic lupus erythematosus in which the initial presentation was hypereosinophilia related Loeffler endocarditis.
