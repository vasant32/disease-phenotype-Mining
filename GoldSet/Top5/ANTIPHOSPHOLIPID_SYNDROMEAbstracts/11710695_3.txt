The prevalence and clinical significance of plasma oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and antibodies against oxLDL (anti-oxLDL) were evaluated in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). OxLDL and IgG anti-oxLDL were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in plasma samples from 80 patients with APS. Positive values (mean + 3 SD) for oxLDL and anti-oxLDL were found in 21 (26%) and 19 (24%) of 80 patients with APS, respectively These values were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects. Levels of oxLDL and anti-oxLDL antibodies in subgroupings of patients with APS who had experienced thrombotic events were compared. There were significant differences among the groups for the levels of both oxLDL and anti-oxLDL antibodies. Pairwise comparisons between the groups yielded similar but not identical results. There was a significant, positive correlation between levels of plasma oxLDL and anti-oxLDL. These results suggest that elevated levels of plasma oxLDL and anti-oxLDL may be risk factors and potential markers for thrombosis, especially for arterial thrombotic events, in patients with APS.
