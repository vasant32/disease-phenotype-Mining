A child presented with ischaemic episodes of his left leg from the age of 2 months. He was found to have raised anticardiolipin antibodies so was started on low dose aspirin. At a three year follow up he was asymptomatic with a normal anticardiolipin antibody level while taking aspirin daily, probably for life.
