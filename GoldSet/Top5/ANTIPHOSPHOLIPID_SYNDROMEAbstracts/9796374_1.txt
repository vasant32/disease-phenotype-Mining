In this paper we tried to define the capillaroscopic pattern of anti phospholipid syndrome able to differentiate between the primary (PAPS) and the systemic lupus erythematosus-associated form (SLE-APS) and to be a predictive marker of thrombotic manifestations. Eight PAPS and five SLE-APS patients were studied. In each patient the evaluation was based on anti cardiolipin antibody levels, nailfold capillaroscopy, retinal fluorangiography and transcranial doppler sonography. Statistical analysis has been performed using chi 2 analysis. Morphological alterations of capillary loops, venular visibility and sludging of blood were often observed in both groups. While we found in higher prevalence a variability of capillary loop length in PAPS patients, the SLE-APL group significantly differed for the presence of microhaemorrhages (p < 0.001). When we evaluated the clinical history, a marked microcirculatory damage was related with the occurrence of thrombotic manifestations in the PAPS patients. Anti cardiolipin antibody levels, retinal fluorangiography and transcranial doppler sonography did not correlate with clinical history in either group. In conclusion, nailfold capillaroscopy can be usefully employed in the differentiation between primary and SLE-associated anti phospholipid syndrome, and it can help to identify the patients at higher risk of thrombotic disease.
