Aspirin is the drug of choice in most patients with acute stroke, if thrombolysis is contraindicated. Heparin is only used in acute stroke due to cerebral venous thrombosis, extracranial carotid or vertebral artery dissection and cardiac emboli with high risk of recurrence. In the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with a noncardioembolic ischemic stroke antiplatelet agents are used. Aspirin is the first-line agent. Clopidogrel or a combination aspirin/dipyridamol are recommended for patients with several risk factors or recurrent cerebrovascular events. Warfarin has demonstrated a clear efficacy in stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, cerebral venous thrombosis and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Other, less well established possible indications for warfarin in the secondary prevention of stroke are symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis, large aortic atheroma, extracranial carotid or vertebral artery dissection and patent foramen ovale.
