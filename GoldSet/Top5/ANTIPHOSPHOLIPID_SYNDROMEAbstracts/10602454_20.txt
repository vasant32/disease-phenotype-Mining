We report the case of a patient with an acute cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection who developed Hughes syndrome, manifested by a common iliac vein thrombosis. IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) appeared with the onset of the infection, followed later by IgG aCL. Five months later, both IgM and IgG aCL levels disappeared from the serum. This is the second case of Hughes syndrome associated with CMV infection to be reported in the literature.
