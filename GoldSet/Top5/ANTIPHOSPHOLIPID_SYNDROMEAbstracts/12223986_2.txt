The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of IgG anticardiolipin antibody (ACL) and IgG anti-beta(2) glycoprotein I antibody (anti-beta2GPI) positivity in patients with primary or secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), to assess the association between IgG ACL and anti-beta2GPI, and the relationship between the presence of ACL and anti-beta2GPI with the clinical manifestations of APS. IgG ACL and IgG anti-beta2GPI levels were measured in 51 SLE patients, 20 patients with SLE and APS (secondary APS) and 11 primary APS patients using commercially available ELISA kits. Relationships between laboratory data and clinical manifestations of the patients were examined. The incidence of IgG ACL positivity was significantly higher in primary (36.4%) and secondary (40%) APS than in SLE (13.7%) patients (P = 0.02). The incidence of IgG anti-beta2GPI positivity was significantly higher in primary (54.5%) and secondary (35%) APS than in SLE (7.8%) patients (P = 0.0006). Mean levels of IgG ACL and anti-beta2GPI were significantly higher in the primary and secondary APS than in the SLE patients (P = 0.002 for both). A significant relationship was found between IgG ACL and IgG anti-beta2GPI (P = 0.01, R(2) = 0.56). There was a significant correlation between the presence of IgG ACL and a history of thrombosis in the combined primary and secondary APS group, but not in SLE patients. In conclusion, in this study IgG ACL and IgG anti-beta2GPI are closely related and mean levels of IgG ACL and IgG anti-beta2GPI are higher in patients with either primary or secondary APS than in SLE patients.
