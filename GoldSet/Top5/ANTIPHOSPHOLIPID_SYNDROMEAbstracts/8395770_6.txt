OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of low-molecular-weight heparin with regular heparin in the prevention of fetal resorption in mice with the antiphospholipid syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: Antiphospholipid syndrome was passively induced in ICR mice by injecting them with anticardiolipin antibodies on the first day of pregnancy. Subsequently, these mice were treated with low-molecular-weight heparin in two different doses, with regular heparin, and with a placebo. On gestational day 17 the mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the pregnancy outcome was evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed by means of a one-way analysis of variance using Bonferroni's t test. RESULTS: Treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin resulted in a resorption rate of 22.4% as opposed to 41.4% in mice with antiphospholipid syndrome that were given regular heparin and 51.7% in nontreated controls. CONCLUSION: We conclude that low-molecular-weight heparin can prevent fetal resorptions in mice with antiphospholipid syndrome.
