This report describes the case of a 39-year-old man, admitted for the occasional finding of left ventricular, irregular and pedicled mass. Because of the elevated risk of thromboembolism, cardiac surgery was performed with complete removal of the mass. Histologic examination showed it to be composed entirely of thrombotic material. Additional laboratory data revealed the simultaneous presence of two thrombophilic disorders: antiphospholipid syndrome and hyperhomocysteinemia. Screening laboratory evaluation for hypercoagulable states is recommended in similar cases.
