Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder that is characterised by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and a common cause of vascular thromboembolic phenomena. The management of patients with APS is currently directed to antithrombotic medications. The international therapeutic guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation with warfarin indefinitely after the first thrombotic episode. However, therapeutic guidelines lack for a minority group of patients - the patients appropriately anticoagulated with recurrent thromboembolic phenomena. The authors present a clinical report that reveals the therapeutic and diagnostic complexity of this specific group of patients. Regarding recent studies, APS has been revealed as a complex syndrome with multiple pathophysiological mechanisms previously unknown. In this context, new therapeutic approaches have been defended and empirically experienced, with potentially promising results.
