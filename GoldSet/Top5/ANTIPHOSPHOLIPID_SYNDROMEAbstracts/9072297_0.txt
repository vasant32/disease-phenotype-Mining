BACKGROUND: The authors dealt with the urgent problem under what conditions it is possible to achieve in a woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or another collagenosis, or secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) a favourable outcome of pregnancy and the delivery of a healthy infant. METHODS AND RESULTS: The investigation comprised 23 women incl. 20 with SLE, two with the mixed form of a diffuse connective tissue disease (MCTD) and one with Sj√∂gren's syndrome of the primary type. From the total number of 20 pregnancies six were consulted in advance with a doctor (group I-s-called planned pregnancies) and all terminated by a successful delivery. Of 11 pregnancies which were not consulted with a doctor in advance (group II-so-called unplanned pregnancies) 9 were terminated in term, however, only 5 with a successful delivery (55.5%), two women are still pregnant. Exacerbation of the basic disease during pregnancy was recorded only once and did not lead to discontinuation of the pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The authors provide evidence that desired pregnancy of informed women suffering from SLE or another collagenosis when assisted by a specialized medical team can lead to a successful delivery of an infant.
