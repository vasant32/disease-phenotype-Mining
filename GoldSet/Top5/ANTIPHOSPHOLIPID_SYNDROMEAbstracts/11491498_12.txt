OBJECTIVE: Reports have shown that anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies present in patients with autoimmune diseases are dependent on the cofactor,beta2 glycoprotein I (beta2 GPI), as opposed to aCL antibodies seen in infectious diseases such as syphilis, HIV hepatitis C, etc. The assay for anti-beta2GPI antibodies has been reported to be more specific for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). However, the prevalence of these antibodies in diseases such as leishmaniasis and leptospirosis remains unknown. The aim of the present study was determine the prevalence of antibodies to cardiolipin and to beta2GPI in patients with different infectious diseases, including leptospirosis, syphilis and leishmaniasis. METHODS: Samples from patients with Kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis), syphilis or leptospirosis were tested for IgG and IgM anticardiolipin and IgG anti-beta2GPI antibodies by ELISA. RESULTS: In patients with Kala-azar the prevalence of IgG aCL, IgM aCL and anti-beta2GPI was 6% (2/30), 3% (1/30) and 53% (16/30), respectively. In syphilis the prevalence was 18% (14/74), 13% (10/74) and 10% (8/70), respectively. In leptospirosis the frequency of these antibodies was 23% (9/39), 10% (4/39) and 17% (6/34), respectively. There was no statistical correlation between aCL and anti-beta2GPI antibodies in these diseases. DISCUSSION: This study clearly shows a significant prevalence of anti-beta2GPI antibodies in leptospirosis and leishmaniasis and syphilis. This indicates that the assay for antibeta2GPI antibodies should be thoroughly validated before it is introduced as a definitive tool for the diagnosis of APS, testing a larger number of sera from patients with a wider range of clinical conditions.
