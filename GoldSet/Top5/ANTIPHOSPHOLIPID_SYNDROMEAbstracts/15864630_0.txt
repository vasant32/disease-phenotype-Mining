 PURPOSE: To report a case of hypopyon uveitis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. METHODS: Interventional case report: a 49-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome presented with sudden onset of pain, redness, photophobia, and decreased vision in the left eye. Examination revealed hypopyon uveitis and vaso-occlusive retinopathy. RESULTS: Following treatment with intravenous steroids and cyclophosphamide, the patient's vision improved from CF to 20/80 with no inflammation 6 months following initial presentation. CONCLUSIONS: In this case, systemic lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome were associated with hypopyon uveitis. Prompt treatment with systemic immunosuppressive therapy resulted in improvement in the hypopyon uveitis and vaso-occlusive retinopathy.
