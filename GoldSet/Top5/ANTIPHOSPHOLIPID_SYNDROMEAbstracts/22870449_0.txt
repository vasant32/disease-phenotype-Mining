The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder presenting with tissue injury in various organs related to large- or small-vessel thrombosis associated with antiphospholipid and antiprotein/phospholipid complex antibodies. Although the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and clinical scenario may seem clear and straightforward, a more detailed examination reveals a more complex and uncertain picture related to the management of APS. This article reviews the current situation relating to APS therapy by evaluating the different clinical features of the syndrome ranging from thrombosis to pregnancy complications together with new strategies and pharmacological approaches.
