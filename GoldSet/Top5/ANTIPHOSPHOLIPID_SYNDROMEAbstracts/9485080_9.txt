OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of ciprofloxacin in mice with experimental antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). METHODS: Ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime (control antibiotic) was given to mice with experimentally induced APS. The titers of autoantibodies, levels of cytokines, and number of cytokine-producing cells were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Myeloid progenitor cells were determined by granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit, and interleukin-3 (IL-3) messenger RNA (mRNA) was tested by Northern analysis. RESULTS: A decrease in the incidence of pregnancy loss and an improvement in the clinical manifestations of APS were noted in the mice treated with ciprofloxacin, compared with the mice given ceftazidime. The effect of ciprofloxacin was found to be associated with increased serum levels of IL-3 and with increased IL-3 mRNA transcription in the splenocytes. Expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was documented by elevated titers in the sera and elevated numbers of colony-forming cells in the bone marrow. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin prevents the manifestations of experimental APS. This effect may be associated with increased IL-3 levels and GM-CSF expression.
