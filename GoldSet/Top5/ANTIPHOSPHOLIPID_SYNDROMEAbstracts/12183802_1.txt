HISTORY: A 56-year-old man was admitted for investigation of abdominal pain radiating to the back. The patient was known to suffer from APS and autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and was therefore treated with oral anticoagulants. The clinical examination was normal. INVESTIGATIONS: Ultrasound detected an area with low echogenicity in the region of the right adrenal gland. A CAT scan identified this mass as an adrenal hemorrhage. DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT: Anticoagulation treatment was discontinued because the bleeding and thrombocytopenia and the patient's pain subsided. A few days later, he experienced similar pain, this time radiating to the left side. A second hematoma was discovered in the left adrenal gland. The patient developed symptoms of acute adrenal insufficiency, which subsided after therapy. The bilateral adrenal hemorrhage was considered to be secondary bleeding following thromboses in the venous system of the adrenal gland. The thromboses were due to the underlying APS. Anticoagulation therapy was resumed, and the patient's condition stabilised without further complications. CONCLUSION: The cessation of anticoagulation therapy in this patient paradoxically led to hemorrhage, this time of the contralateral adrenal gland. Unilateral and, especially, bilateral adrenal bleeding should give rise to the suspicion of thrombophilic disorders such as APS or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT); for which careful anticoagulation is the treatment of choice.
