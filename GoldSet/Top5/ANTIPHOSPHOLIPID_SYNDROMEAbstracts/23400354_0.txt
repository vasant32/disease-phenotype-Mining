PURPOSE: Periodontal disease is considered to be a risk factor for threatened preterm labor (TPL) and preterm birth (PB), but pathogenic mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. We hypothesized that infection with periodontopathic bacteria may enhance thrombosis through molecular mimicry with TLRVYK peptides on beta-2 glycoprotein I, a target molecule in anti-phospholipid syndrome. This study aimed to examine the effects of periodontitis on TPL and PB. METHODS: Ninety-five pregnant women (47 TPL and 48 healthy subjects) participated. Periodontal clinical parameters and periodontopathic bacteria were examined. Molecular mimicry between TLRVYK peptides and homologous peptides on the periodontopathic bacteria was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for the respective peptides (SIRVYK on Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, TLRIYT on Porphyromonus gingivalis, and TLALYK on Treponema denticola). Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, anti-TLRVYK and anti-SIRVYK IgG antibodies were measured using ELISA. RESULTS: Among the rabbit antibodies specific for the bacterial homologous peptides, only anti-SIRVYK IgG antibody reacted with TLRVYK peptides. Multivariable analysis showed that anti-SIRVYK IgG antibody was significantly associated with diagnosis of TPL. Of 95 births, 14 (14.7 %) delivered preterm. The preterm birth rate was higher in the anti-SIRVYK IgG antibody >median group than in the ≤median group. Of the 47 TPL subjects 13 had PB, and ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed that past smoking, presence of P. gingivalis and anti-SIRVYK IgG antibody were significantly correlated with PB. CONCLUSIONS: Infection with P. gingivalis and the antibody response to SIRVYK might be associated with TPL and PB.
