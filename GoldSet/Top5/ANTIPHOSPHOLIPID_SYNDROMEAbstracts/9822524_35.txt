OBJECTIVE: This study's objective was to evaluate the association between venous thromboembolism during pregnancy and the postpartum period and the factor V Arg 506 Gln (factor V Leiden), the prothrombin G20210A, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphisms. STUDY DESIGN: In this case-control study 42 case patients and 213 control subjects (parous age-matched women without history of thrombosis) were genotyped for all the polymorphisms. Moreover, antiphospholipid antibodies and protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III deficiencies were investigated in each case. RESULTS: Ten case patients (23.8%) and 4 control subjects (1.9%; odds ratio 16.3, 95% confidence interval 4.8-54.9) carried the factor V Leiden mutation; 13 case patients (31.0%) and 9 control subjects (4.2%; odds ratio 10.2, 95% confidence interval 4.0-25.9) were carriers of the prothrombin G20210A allele. Finally, 12 case patients (28.6%) and 34 control subjects (16.0%; odds ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.0-4.5) were homozygotes for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T. Overall, mutations were found in 25 case patients (59.5%) and 47 control patients (22.2%; odds ratio 5.2, 95% confidence interval 4.9-19.6). One patient carried the antithrombin III deficiency and 1 the protein S deficiency, whereas 2 women had a primary antiphospholipid syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The significant risk estimates of having a pregnancy-related venous thromboembolism in the presence of the prothrombotic genetic risk factors analyzed suggest to screen for these mutations women with a personal history of thromboembolic events during pregnancy or the postpartum period.
