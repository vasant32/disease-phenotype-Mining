Although antiphospholipid antibodies have been detected in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, the clinical manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome are extremely rare. We describe a woman with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and elevated antiphospholipid antibodies who developed necrotic skin lesions and was subsequently shown to have antiphospholipid syndrome. This finding contradicts the general belief that such antibodies are not clinically significant in patients with HIV disease. We follow the report with a brief description of the antiphospholipid syndrome and its relation to AIDS.
