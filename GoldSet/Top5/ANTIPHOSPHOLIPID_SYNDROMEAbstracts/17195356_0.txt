Classification criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome were first proposed in 1987, revised in 1999 (Sapporo criteria) and up-dated in 2006. The aim of the study was to analyze associations between clinical and laboratory symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome in the group of patients with autoimmune diseases, based on recently up-dated classification criteria. 336 patients were enrolled into the study, with the majority (n=235) suffering from SLE. Laboratory determinations included: lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (abeta2GPI) (both of IgG and IgM class). Clinical and laboratory symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome were quite common among patients studied. There was a significant association between laboratory and clinical features of antiphospholipid syndrome, according to recently modified classification criteria.
