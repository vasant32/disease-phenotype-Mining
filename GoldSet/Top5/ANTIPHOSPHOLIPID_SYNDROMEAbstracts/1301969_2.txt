The frequency of two common idiotypes of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) was determined in sera from three groups of subjects, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) and with monoclonal gammopathies (MG), as compared to normal population. The idiotype 1.10, which was derived from a patient with active SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome, was found more frequently among patients with PAPS (10.5%, 10.5% and 22.2% in MG, SLE and PAPS, respectively) than the idiotype H3, which was derived from a human hybridoma monoclonal aCL generated from a healthy subject immunized with tetanus and diphtheria. The latter idiotype was detected in 8.7%, 6.5% and 11.7% of patients with MG, SLE and PAPS, respectively. Incidental findings in this study include a high prevalence of aCL among patients with MG (23%) and a high prevalence of anti-dsDNA antibodies, detected only by a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, among patients with PAPS. Our results indicate that idiotypic diversity exists among aCL derived from different sources. Some of these cross-reactive idiotypes may be more pathogenic than others.
