PURPOSE: The association of antiphosphatidylethanolamine antibodies (aPE) as the only antiphospholipid antibody with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is discussed. The aPE was described as the sole antibody in many cases suggesting APS. aPE was not included in the Sapporo criteria for the classification of APS. METHODS: We investigated the clinical features of 20 patients with aPE only; 17 patients had symptoms potentially related to APS (group 1) and three had other manifestations (group 2). RESULTS: There were 15 women and five men, mean age was 35 +/- 12 years at the beginning. In group 1 (n = 17), ten patients presented arterial thrombosis, nine venous thrombosis (five had both), and six microvascular thrombosis (livedo reticularis, lacunar pathology). The aPE positivity was persistent in 13 patients. A subgroup of four patients (three women) presented arteriosclerosis with peripheral arteriopathy which started before 45 years of age. They had another atherosclerosis risk factor associated with aPE persistence. In group 2 (n = 3), there was no thrombotic event, one demyelinating pathology, one microvascular pathology, and one arterial dysplasia. The aPE positivity was never confirmed. Finally, 13 patients presented an APS with aPE only, confirmed at least 8 weeks later. CONCLUSIONS: Our study points out that testing for aPE would be of interest for patients when symptoms were potentially related to APS, particularly when other antiphospholipid antibodies were negative. This description questions the enlargement of the APS biological criteria defined in Sapporo. The role of aPE in atherosclerosis is considered.
