Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with fetal distress and fetal death. Although different therapeutic regimens have been used, the incidence of fetal growth retardation varies between 30 and 60 per cent of reported cases. We report the evolution of fetal growth in patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome treated with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). Fourteen patients with a history of recurrent spontaneous abortion and immunological diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome were followed longitudinally. Intravenous immunoglobulin at a dose of 0.5 g/kg body weight for two consecutive days was started from the fifth week of pregnancy and repeated every 4 weeks until the 33rd week of gestation. Fetal biometry was evaluated longitudinally from the appearance of the gestational sac at 4 weekly intervals. In the period between 26 and 34 weeks, the frequency of evaluation was increased to every 14 days. Data obtained were compared with a control group of 70 fetuses with uneventful pregnancies matched for gestational age. Neonatal weight is shown in relation to the centiles for the normal population. One patient out of 14 (7.1 per cent) developed gestational hypertension and abruptio placentae. No other pregnancy complications were seen. No proteinuria was found. The mean maternal age was 31.2 +/- 3.8 years. Median birth weight was 3433 g +/- 287. The median centile of the birth weight was 65.3 +/- 18.6. Mean gestational age at delivery was 1.3 weeks. No fetal or neonatal growth retardation was seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
