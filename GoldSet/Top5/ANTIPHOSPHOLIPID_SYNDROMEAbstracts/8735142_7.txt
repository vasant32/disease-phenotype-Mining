We studied both inherited and acquired activated protein C (APC) resistance in a group of 22 patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The APC resistance genotype was assessed using a PCR-based analysis for the factor V R506Q (Leiden) mutation. One patient with primary APS was found to be heterozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation. He and other family members were affected by severe thrombophilia and had a familial form of primary APS. The APC resistance phenotype was assessed by measuring the prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin clotting time in response to APC. It was found in five out of six patients with APS, in one of them transiently. We have found that the APC resistance phenotype is more frequent than the genotype in primary APS. It would seem that patients with thrombophilia should be investigated for APC resistance even if found to have antiphospholipid antibodies and/or lupus anticoagulants.
