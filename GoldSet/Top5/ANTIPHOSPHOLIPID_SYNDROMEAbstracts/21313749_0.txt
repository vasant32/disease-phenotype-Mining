The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is antibody-induced thrombosis, whose diagnostic basis is the obligatory presence of serological markers along with clinical manifestations. Its laboratory markers are antiphospholipid antibodies (aPAs), the highest informative value has been proven for lupus anticoagulant (LA), cardiolipin antibodies, fl-glycoprotein 1. LA should be determined at a laboratory in accordance with the recommendations of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Obstetric abnormality in APS should be regarded as a thrombotic complication and its management in this case does not differ from that and prevention of thrombosis, aPAs may be detectable in various illnesses, but their blood presence is not an indication for immunosuppressive therapy. The paper describes a case of primary APS in a female patient.
