Beta2glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) is a 54-kDa plasma protein which is recognized as an autoantigen for antibodies from patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). SDS-PAGE (under reducing conditions) of beta2GPI from three sources indicates that the 54-kDa beta2GPI band is accompanied by a band corresponding to an 8-kDa protein. In the absence of detergent and reducing agents (native PAGE), beta2GPI demonstrated a large complex (molecular mass approximately 320 kDa) which is dissociable by boiling in 6-8 M urea, yielding several lower molecular mass bands, one of which corresponds to the 8-kDa protein observed in SDS-PAGE. Sera from five healthy adults demonstrated native beta2GPI migration equivalent to the commercially purified protein. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of native beta2GPI show aggregrates of particles each having a diameter of 30-35 nm. This is consistent with a globular unit the size of which would be substantially larger than that expected for a 54-kDa protein. These experiments suggest that the 54-kDa beta2GPI monomer subunits exist as a multimeric complex with the 8-kDa protein.
