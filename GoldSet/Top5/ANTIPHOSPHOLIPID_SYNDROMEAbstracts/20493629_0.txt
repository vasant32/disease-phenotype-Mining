Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) has been widely recognized to be associated with various neurological complications. In addition to the classical notion of APS as a thrombotic disorder, APS has been suggested to be an autoinflammatory disease as well. We present a previously healthy 46-year-old man who concurrently developed transverse myelitis and polymyositis whose laboratory studies were significant for the elevated antiphospholipid antibodies such as anti-cardiolipin (CL)/beta2-glycoprotein I (beta 2GPI) antibody. This report further enhances the recognized clinical phenotypes of the neurological complications of APS and the understanding of its pathomechanism.
