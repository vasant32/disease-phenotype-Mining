BACKGROUND: Usually, preeclampsia is a disease of the second half of pregnancy (i.e., beyond 20 weeks' gestation). Early-onset preeclampsia has been reported in association with the antiphospholipid syndrome, however, the cases reported have been at 25-30 weeks' gestation. CASES: Three pregnant women presented with clinical and laboratory features of severe preeclampsia and the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) before 20 weeks' gestation. On evaluation, they were found to have antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin and/or lupus anticoagulant). Two of the patients had abdominal computed tomography scans that showed a low-density area along the hepatic periphery, compatible with hepatic infarction. Spontaneous resolution of all clinical and laboratory manifestations of preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome was observed after fetal death and pregnancy termination. CONCLUSION: Preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome can present before 20 weeks' gestation in association with the antiphospholipid syndrome and may be associated with hepatic infarction.
