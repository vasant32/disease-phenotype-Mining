Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a rare but life-threatening condition, which needs emergent treatment in children. Though anticoagulation is the standard treatment for PE, recent studies revealed intrapulmonary thrombolytic therapy may produce more rapid clot lysis and less systemic complications in adult patients. We reported a 10-year-old girl who had diffused multiple pulmonary emboli due to primary antiphospholipid syndrome. The thrombi persisted in spite of intravenous heparin infusion for 3 days, which resolved quickly after intrapulmonary streptokinase infusion for 12 hours.
