Infections are considered one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and occasionally can trigger a catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). We describe a 22-year-old SLE patient with lupus nephritis under immunosuppressant therapy and asymptomatic carrier of antiphospholipid antibodies, who was admitted with tonsillitis and acute hepatitis, developing multiorgan failure in a few hours. Postmortem examination revealed hepatic necrosis, tonsillitis, pharyngitis and uterine cervicitis caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) together with microthrombosis in lungs and glomerular arterioles, suggesting the diagnosis of fulminant HSV disseminated infection and catastrophic APS.
