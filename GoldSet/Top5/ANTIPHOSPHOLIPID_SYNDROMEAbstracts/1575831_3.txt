Antiphospholipid antibodies, notably the lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies, are associated with recurrent fetal wastage, pregnancy complications, and thromboses. Aggressive medical treatment using aspirin and steroids has been recommended. Fifty-one patients with antiphospholipid antibodies, only four with underlying connective tissue disorders, were followed through 53 pregnancies. Aggressive therapy was used in 33 pregnancies, 90.9% of which resulted in successful obstetric outcomes, a highly statistically significant difference compared with previous pregnancies in the same patients. Most pregnancies among nine patients receiving single-agent therapy (aspirin or steroids alone) and eight patients not treated also had successful outcomes. A 48.6% complication rate was found in association with therapy, particularly gestational diabetes mellitus. There was no statistical correlation between dose or duration of therapy and development of treatment-related complications. Although a subgroup of patients with antiphospholipid antibodies will benefit from aggressive therapy, the high complication rate warrants close observation.
