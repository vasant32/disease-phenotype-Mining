Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) that promote thrombosis, pregnancy complications and cardiovascular diseases. Alterations in the function of vascular cells induced by aPL underlie these outcomes. This review will discuss recent findings that indicate a novel mechanism by which aPL antagonize endothelial cell production of nitric oxide and thereby promote thrombosis.
