A 57-year-old man with no evidence of infection, vasculitis or connective tissue disease died with multiple organ thromboses after an acute illness. He was found to have lupus anticoagulant, IgG anticardiolipin antibody, false positive rapid plasma reagin, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, and thrombocytopenia. Venous and arterial thrombi leading to necrosis were found in his scrotum, testicles, upper and lower extremities, adrenals, kidneys, lungs, and brain. No other explanation could be found for his fatal illness, thus suggesting the primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). This is a documented case of primary APS associated with multiorgan arterial and venous thromboses of large and small vessels, presenting as a fulminant and fatal acute illness.
