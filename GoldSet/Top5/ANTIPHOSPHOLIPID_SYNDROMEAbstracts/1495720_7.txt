Middle cerebral artery infarction explains some cases of congenital hemiparesis with or without neonatal stroke. The etiology of the stroke is often obscure. We describe two infants with imaging evidence of middle cerebral artery infarction whose mothers had elevated anticardiolipin antibody levels after delivery. We speculate that these antibodies may have been responsible for intrauterine thromboembolic stroke.
