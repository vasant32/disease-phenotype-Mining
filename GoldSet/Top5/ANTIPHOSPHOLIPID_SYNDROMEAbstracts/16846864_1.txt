This prospective, observational study was carried out in a teaching hospital in Calcutta, India. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) among women with recurrent miscarriages/late pregnancy loss when no other apparent causes were identified, in the study population. The women were put through a variety of investigations to determine the cause of miscarriage/pregnancy loss. Only those women who had a normal result for all the investigation went for the anti-phospholipid antibodies (APLA) test. The expelled products of conception/placenta were also sent for histopathological confirmation. A total of 445 women were studied over a 4-year period. A total of 155 women were offered a screening for APLA antibodies. Out of them, 43 women (27.7%) tested positive for APLA. Histopathological evidence was present in all the specimens. Interestingly, one woman had histopathological evidence of thrombosis, but her blood tests for the antibody were negative.
