A 22-year-old female with history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was referred for evaluation of decreased visual acuity in her right eye. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at the time of presentation was 20/160. Widespread cotton wool spots and macular edema were seen on biomicroscopy. Fluorescein angiography (FA) revealed retinal arterial and venous obstruction with capillary nonperfusion at the superotemporal retina. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) was diagnosed based on positive lupus anti-coagulant and ocular manifestations. Scattered laser photocoagulation was applied at the nonperfusion area but the visual acuity continued to deteriorate due to macular edema. Intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) was administered for macular edema. One day after IVB, the BCVA decreased to count fingers. FA revealed extended non-perfusion from the superotemporal area to the posterior pole. Use of intravitreal bevacizumab for macular edema secondary to SLE or APS should be considered carefully and patients monitored closely for vascular complications.
