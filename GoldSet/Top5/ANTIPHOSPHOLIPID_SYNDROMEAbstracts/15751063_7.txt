 OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence and clinical associations of abnormalities on electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and/or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who have neuropsychiatric symptoms. METHODS: The study group comprised 57 patients (age </=50 years) with manifestations of neuropsychiatric illness. Patients with stroke, epilepsy, or other encephalopathies were excluded. Fourteen patients had APS, 24 patients were positive for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), and 19 patients had SLE without aPL. All patients underwent EEG and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) while they were awake. RESULTS: Abnormal EEG findings (showing mainly bitemporal slow activity) were recorded in 37 of 57 patients (65%). Abnormal EEG findings were observed in all patients with APS and in 17 of 24 aPL-positive patients (71%), compared with 6 of 19 patients with SLE (32%) (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). There was an association between abnormal EEG findings and the frequency of aPL positivity (at least 2 positive results) (P = 0.002). Three EEG recordings showed potentially epileptiform activity. Results of brain MRI were abnormal in 18 (31.6%) of 57 patients: 8 in the APS group (57.1%), 7 in the aPL-positive group (29.2%), and 3 in the SLE group (15.8%). None of the patients with normal EEG findings had abnormal MRI results. Thus, brain MRI findings were normal in the majority of patients. Patients with abnormal EEG results were more likely to report memory problems (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that EEG abnormalities are common and correlate with the presence of aPL even in the absence of brain abnormalities on MRI. EEG should be considered in aPL-positive patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms, because use of antiaggregants or anticoagulation may need to be considered.
