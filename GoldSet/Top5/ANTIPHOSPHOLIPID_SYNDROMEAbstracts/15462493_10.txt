Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD) is a novel fibrosing disorder of the skin with characteristic histopathology. It affects patients with impaired renal function and appears to be independent from the type of kidney disease. Its aetiopathology is unknown and presently no standard therapy exists. We report a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and glomerulonephritis who developed diffuse indurated erythematous plaques covering nearly the entire legs and trunk. She had never received dialysis. The second patient suffered from SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome related thrombotic glomerulopathy. After 10 weeks of haemodialysis she developed the same skin condition. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first reports of NFD occurring in patients with SLE.
