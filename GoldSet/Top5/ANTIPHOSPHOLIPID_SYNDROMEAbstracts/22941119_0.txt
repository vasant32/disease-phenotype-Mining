The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of T-helper cell subtypes             Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and whether they are             related to anti-cardiolipin antibody (aPL) titers. Peripheral mononuclear cells             (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy donors, and incubated with aPLs. Subsequent             to a 48â€‘h incubation, PBMCs were collected and detected by flow cytometry. The             results revealed that aPLs at higher concentrations may induce a significant increase             in Th2 and Th17 frequencies, as opposed to a significant decrease in Th1 and Treg             frequencies and the Th1/Th2 ratio. These results indicate that there is a Th1/Th2             imbalance, a Th17 upregulation and a Treg downregulation present in APS, and that             these factors are positively correlated with aPL titers, suggesting a potential             role of Th cells in the pathogenesis of APS.
