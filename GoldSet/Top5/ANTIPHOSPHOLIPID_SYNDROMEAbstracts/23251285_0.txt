The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of traditional treatment (prednisone and aspirin) and comprehensive treatment [prednisone, aspirin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and IVIg] on the pregnancy outcome, obstetric complications and fetal outcome in women with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). In the present trial, we observed and evaluated 129 women with APS. Eighty-seven patients received traditional treatment and 42 patients received comprehensive treatment. In the traditional treatment group and comprehensive treatment group, the live birth rate was 83.91 and 97.62% (P<0.05), respectively, and the obstetric morbidity was 22.99 and 7.14% (P<0.05), respectively. The neonatal weight in the comprehensive treatment group was increased compared with the traditional treatment group (P<0.05), however, no differences were found in gestational age at delivery or preterm labor. Comprehensive treatment improved the result of gestation and reduced obstetric complications, and is a more effective treatment for APS than the traditional method using prednisone and aspirin.
