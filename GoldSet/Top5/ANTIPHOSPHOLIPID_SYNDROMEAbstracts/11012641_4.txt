A 24-year-old woman with an unremarkable medical history who developed bilateral deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli is presented. Associated findings were severe eosinophilia and moderate thrombocytopenia. Since the major acquired and hereditary thrombogenic disorders were ruled out in this case (including antiphospholipid syndrome and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), we believe that the severe eosinophilia per se could be the pro-coagulant factor leading to thrombosis and embolism in our patient. The role of eosinophilia in thrombosis is discussed.
