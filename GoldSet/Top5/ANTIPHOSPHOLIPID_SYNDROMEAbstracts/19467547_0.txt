Several apparently idiopathic cases of so called 'senile chorea' have been recently redefined by the availability of brain MRI scan and the clinical introduction of genetic testing for Huntington's disease. Cases currently still regarded as idiopathic might yet be attributed to other medical conditions. Chorea as a unique manifestation of a primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) has so far been described only in young and middle-aged subjects. Here, we report a typical case of 'senile chorea' associated with PAPS, thus expanding the potential underlying etiologies and further narrowing the window of primary 'senile chorea'.
