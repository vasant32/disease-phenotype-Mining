Results obtained in three patients with juvenile ischemic stroke and criteria of primary antiphospholipid syndrome is reported. These patients are selected out from a series of 12 patients with 18-mounts follow-up. Lupic anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were found in two of three patients and one patient show anticardiolipin antibodies with negative lupic anticoagulant. All others coagulation proteins examined (antithrombin III, plasminogen, protein C and protein S) were normal. We conclude that antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with increase risk of thrombosis. Therefore should be systematically investigated in juvenile ischemic stroke of unknown aetiology.
