Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are closely related, but each has it own characteristic vasculopathy: vasculitis in SLE and thrombosis in APS, and either may be a serious or life threatening complication. When a patient has SLE associated with APS, systemic and cerebral vasculitis may coexist with disseminated coagulopathy. We report this complication in a 60-year-old woman who died from stroke and myocardial infarction, an occurrence seldom documented in the literature.
