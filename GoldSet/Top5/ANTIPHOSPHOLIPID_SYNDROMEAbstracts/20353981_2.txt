Only few studies have addressed the pathogenesis and treatment of the non-criteria manifestations of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) such as thrombocytopenia, nephropathy, cardiac valve disease, cognitive dysfunction, skin ulcers, or diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage. There is no consensus on the management of these manifestations; they may occur despite full-dose anticoagulation or may not improve if anticoagulation is initiated after their discovery. This brief review may help physicians in the management of the non-criteria manifestations of aPL.
