Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) often presents as a multisystem disorder characterized by recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis and pregnancy loss. We present a 46-year-old female who was admitted with oliguric acute renal failure. APS was suspected due to prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time and history of miscarriages. Investigations for secondary causes were normal. Renal biopsy findings revealed thrombotic microangiopathy. A complete recovery of renal function was attained with a combination of plasma exchange and pulse methylprednisolone followed by oral steroids and warfarin. The case is presented for its rarity and therapeutic implications.
