PURPOSE: To report a case of bilateral choroidal infarction occurring as a complication of primary antiphospholipid syndrome. METHODS: The case notes of the patient were reviewed. RESULTS: A 25-year-old man with primary antiphospholipid syndrome and a previous history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, developed episcleritis and bilateral choroidal infarction, with deterioration of vision to 6/12 OD and counting fingers at 5 feet OS. Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin was administered and the patient's vision gradually improved to 6/6 OD and 6/9 OS. CONCLUSION: Primary antiphospholipid syndrome is associated with thrombotic phenomena, which may affect the ocular arterial and venous vasculature. Therefore, a detailed ophthalmological examination is warranted in those patients who present with ocular symptoms and deteriorating vision. Retinal fluorescein angiography is valuable in confirming the diagnosis when in doubt, and in determining the extent of vessel occlusion.
