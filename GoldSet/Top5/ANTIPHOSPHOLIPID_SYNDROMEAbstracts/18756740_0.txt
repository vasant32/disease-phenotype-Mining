The antiphospholipid syndrome (APhS) is autoimmune non-inflammatory trombotic vasculopathy, associated with damage of vessels of any caliber and localization that determines the diversity of clinical manifestations of this syndrome. One of possible localizations of thrombosis in AphS is pseudoinfective endocarditis (PsIE). We have performed analysis of clinical and laboratory features of APhS, associated with PsIE. 28 APhS patients with PsIE, average age--44+/-13 years, were included in the study. Among them 21 patients had primary form of APhS, 7 cases had secondary form of APhS. For statistical treatment of the results the logistic regression (SPSS for Windows. Release 11.5.0.) was used, the confidence level of differences between groups was determined with the use of Student's test. Heart valve abnormalities occurred in 100% of patients and included valvular thickening, induration and sclerosis, the presence of valve vegetations, focip of calcinosis and different grade of valve dysfunction. Mitral and aortal valve vegetations occurred with the same incidence (64%), both valves were been involved in 29% of cases. Positive associations with presence/development of PsIE in APhS from multivariant model data included mitral valve lesion (OR: 0.029), focal cardiofibrosis (OR: 0.084), prior valve lesion (OR: 0.087), negative associations--hemicrania (OR: 8.627) and secondary form of APhS (OR: 6.425). Moderately high titer of lupous anticoagulant (multivariant model) (OR: 3.753) seemed to be prognostic marker of PsIE. In half of patients with APhS and PsIE systemic embolisms appeared, embolic cerebrovascular complications were the most frequent (32%). The possibility of development of hemodynamically significant valve dysfunction that needs valve replacement and nececcity of making of differential diagnosis with infective endocarditis are related to other aspects, important for clinical practice.
