We reported a 26-year-old female who had experienced 2 miscarriages associated with a possible cause of antiphospholipid antibody. She consulted to Kainan Municipal Hospital with major complaints of miscarriages and positive antiphospholipid antibody. No evidence of obstetric disorder was apparent and routine haematological parameters were normal. Serological studies and clinical evidence did not show SLE. While biologically false positive (reaction of serological test for syphilis) and lupus anticoagulant was negative, IgG anticardiolipin antibody was positive. She was diagnosed as possible antiphospholipid antibody syndrome based on positive anticardiolipin antibody and the history of miscarriages. In 1993, she was started on prednisolone and aspirin therapy; antiphospholipid antibody returned to negative. Treatment with prednisolone (7.5 mg/day) and aspirin (40 mg/day) was continued. She was able to be pregnant. She gave birth successfully at our hospital in August 1995. She and her newborn showed no abnormalities.
