Mesenteric venous thrombosis is extremely rare surgical pathology during pregnancy and frequently is associated with hemoglobinopathies beta-thalassemia, congenital defects of the coagulation and antiphospholipide syndrome. It has nontypical clinical appearance, which hardens the timely diagnosis and the adequate surgical treatment. We present a case of a 22 year-old girl with hemozygote form of beta thalassemia, pregnant in ml II, with mesenteric venose thrombosis. The diagnosis was made on the 24th hour from the beginning of the disease. The patient was operated successfully by a resection of the necrotic changed part of the intestine. She noticed vaginal bleeding due to a missed abortion on the 22nd day after the operation.
