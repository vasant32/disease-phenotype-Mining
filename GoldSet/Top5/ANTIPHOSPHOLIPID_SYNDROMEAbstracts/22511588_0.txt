 OBJECTIVE: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is highly prevalent in rheumatic diseases and is recognized as a new independent cardiovascular risk factor. This study was undertaken to determine the clinical significance of MetS in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). METHODS: Seventy-one primary APS patients and 73 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included. Serum samples were tested for lipid profile, Lp(a), glucose, insulin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free T4, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and uric acid. MetS was defined by the International Diabetes Federation criteria, and insulin resistance was established using the homeostasis model assessment index. RESULTS: The prevalence of MetS was 33.8%, and further comparison between primary APS patients with and without MetS revealed that the former had a higher frequency of arterial events (79.2% versus 42.6%; P = 0.003), angina (29.2% versus 2.1%; P = 0.002), and positive lupus anticoagulant antibody (95.8% versus 76.6%; P = 0.049). In addition, primary APS patients with MetS, as expected, had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. On multivariate analysis, only MetS was independently associated with arterial events in primary APS. CONCLUSION: Coexistence of primary APS and MetS seems to identify a subgroup of patients with higher risk of arterial events, suggesting that MetS may aggravate existing endothelial abnormalities of primary APS.
