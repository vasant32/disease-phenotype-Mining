Dynamic scintigraphy (DS) provides qualitative and quantitative assessment of renal circulation in patients with different diseases. Few data are still available on application of DS of the kidneys in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Renal hemodynamics studies with DS are not described in SLE patients with disturbances of renal metabolism and/or antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). We examined renal hemodynamics in SLE patients with renal disease, arterial hypertension, impaired lipid metabolism, APS. We examined 65 patients with confirmed diagnosis of SLE with 99mTc DS and estimated effective renal blood flow. The latter was damaged more in SLE patients with symptoms of renal disorders. Arterial hypertension deteriorated renal hemodynamics. In hypertensive patients with affected kidneys angionephroscintigraphic parameters changed most significantly. Renal hemodynamics in disturbed lipid metabolism was worse than in normal one but the difference was not significant. Angionephroscintigraphy findings were worse in patients with APS than in those with renal lesion and arterial hypertension but free of APS.
