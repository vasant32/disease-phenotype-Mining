We report the case of a 44-year-old male with a 10-year history of manifestations of the rare form of bullous systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with coexisting antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) that remained undiagnosed until thrombotic-embolic episodes appeared and high titres of anticardiolipin (ACL) antibodies were detected. The patient fulfilled the criteria for SLE and the atypical cutaneous manifestations together with histopathological changes and a favourable response to sulphones were the grounds for the diagnosis of the bullous variety of SLE. Treatment with prednisolone, acenocoumarol and dapsone resulted in marked clinical improvement, reduction in antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and normalization of ACL antibody titres.
