 BACKGROUND: Hypercoagulability leading to arterial or venous thrombosis and embolism in patients with cancer is a known phenomenon. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We describe a 62 year old woman with a clinical course compatible with catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome but seronegative findings and mucinous lung cancer. The case is discussed with reference to literature from a non-systematic PubMed search. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: Diagnoses of cerebral and cardiac infarcts, deep venous thrombosis and lung embolism led to a diagnosis of lung cancer by biopsy and positron emission tomography (PET). Early recurrence of venous and arterial thromboses or poor response to anticoagulation and antiplatelets should initiate cancer search in the assessment of such stroke patients. Especially the combination of venous and arterial thromboses should raise suspicion of cancer. PET and surgical cancer treatment should be evaluated at an early stage.
