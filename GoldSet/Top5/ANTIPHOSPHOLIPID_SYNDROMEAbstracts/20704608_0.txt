A case of a 37-year-old pregnant patient with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), who has a medical history of both thrombosis and recurrent fetal loss, is presented. She was treated with predonisolone and fixed-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH) infusion, followed by plasmaphereses and fixed-dose low-molecular-weight heparin infusion during her fourth pregnancy. Unfortunately, this treatment did not have beneficial effects, resulting in intrauterine growth restriction and finally neonatal death. Continuous intravenous UFH infusion and low-dose aspirin were administrated under the monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time to achieve a target level of 120 s during her fifth pregnancy. A healthy baby weighing 1818 g at birth was delivered by Cesarean section at the 34th week of pregnancy. High-dose UFH infusion may be considered to be one of the preferable options to manage pregnant patients with refractory APS.
