A 36-year old woman with recurrent thrombosis manifested in the form of venous thrombosis of the leg, thrombus in the right atrium and ventricle of the heart, pulmonary embolism and recurrent foetal loss, is described. Laboratory results showed prolonged APTT and normal coagulation factors. All this suggested to lupus anticoagulant (LA), which was confirmed by prolonged KCT, DRVVT, false positive VDRL test, and high level of anticardiolipin antibodies (ELISA). The diagnosis of primary antiphospholipid syndrome was established by clinical findings of recurrent thrombosis, foetal loss, presence of LA and anticardiolipin antibodies.
