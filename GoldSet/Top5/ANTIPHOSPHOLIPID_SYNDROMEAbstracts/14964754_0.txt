Thalidomide is increasingly being used for the treatment of a variety of dermatologic conditions. Some of the risks associated with thalidomide use, however, are still being uncovered. Increased incidence of venous thrombosis following thalidomide use has recently been reported in the treatment of diseases with disease-related thrombotic risks, such as malignancy and lupus with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. We report a case of venous thrombosis resulting from thalidomide use in a patient with cicatricial pemphigoid, illustrating the potential concern for increased thrombosis following thalidomide use in the dermatology setting.
