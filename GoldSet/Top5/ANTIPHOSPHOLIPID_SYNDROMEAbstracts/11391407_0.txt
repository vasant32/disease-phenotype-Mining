Degeneration and atrophy of the epidermis, disorganization of the connective tissue, focal atrophy of skeletal myocytes, and diffuse vasculopathy are the main pathomorphological signs found in musculocutaneous bioptates during the antiphospholipid syndrome associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. The major morphogenetic disorder is alteration of microvascular endotheliocytes accompanied by the formation of concentric perivascular mononuclear infiltrates.
