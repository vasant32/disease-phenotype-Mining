Movement disorders (MDs), particularly chorea, may be the presenting neurological complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), but the association is not often initially recognized. Current evidence suggests an autoimmune mechanism related to antiphospholipid antibodies in these two conditions, although the antigenic target within the central nervous system has not yet been identified. Based on a comprehensive review of the literature, this article summarizes the current knowledge on MDs in SLE and APS. A high index of suspicion is required to make an early diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment to provide symptomatic relief and to prevent other systemic complications related to the autoimmune process.
