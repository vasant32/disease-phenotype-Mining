OBJECTIVE: To evaluate familial history for evidence of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and autoimmune disease in rheumatology department patients with primary or secondary APS. METHODS: We retrospectively studied patients with APS and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) managed at the Rheumatology Department of the Bichat University Hospital, Paris, between 1987 and 1996. Data were collected by chart review and by a 1997 standardized telephone interview. RESULTS: We identified 108 patients with APS managed during the ten-year study period. According to classical classification criteria, 39 patients had primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) and 69 secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (SAPS). Family history data were obtained for 29 (74%) and 55 (80%) PAPS and SAPS patients. respectively (78% of the 108 patients). Twelve PAPS (41% and 19 SAPS (35%) patients had one or more relatives with evidence of at least one clinical feature of APS such as thrombosis or recurrent fetal loss; of these patients, seven in the PAPS (24%) and 11 in the SAPS (20%) group had two or more relatives with evidence of a clinical feature of APS. Three PAPS (10%) and 14 SAPS (25%) patients had one or more family members with an autoimmune disease. CONCLUSION: A positive family history for autoimmune disease and/or antiphospholipid syndrome is common in patients with PAPS or SAPS. This finding supports a genetic contribution to APS. The percentage of a positive family history for autoimmune disease tend to be higher in patients with SAPS than in those with PAPS.
