Normal prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) are recommended for administration of recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in stroke, but waiting for results can delay use. We examined the charts of 365 stroke patients to assess predetermined risk factors associated with elevated PT/PTT. Elevated PT/PTT can be predicted in patients taking warfarin or heparin/heparinoid or on hemodialysis, according to emergency department triage, with 100% sensitivity and 94.7% specificity. These results could be applied to rt-PA candidates and reduce potential delays.
