 OBJECTIVE: Clinical outcome of pregnancy in patients with recurrent pregnancy losses treated with IVIG during their current pregnancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 10 pregnant women with 3-5 spontaneous abortions. Any genetic, anatomical or infectious abnormalities were excluded as well as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and negative lymphocytotoxic test. The treatment consisted of passive immunotherapy by means of intravenous administration of immunoglobulin (IVIG) at a dose of 0.4 g/kg b.w. Therapy was commenced at week 5-6 of gestation, infusions were repeated every 3-4 weeks until 28th week of gestation in 5-, 3- and 1-day protocols. In 2 patients that therapy followed active immunotherapy with paternal lymphocytes. RESULTS: Eight (80%) patients bore healthy babies (3 preterm); in 2 cases embryos died at 6-7 week of gestation. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the efficacy of IVIG in pregnant patients with recurrent spontaneous abortions in whom likelihood of immunological pattern of pregnancy failures is high.
