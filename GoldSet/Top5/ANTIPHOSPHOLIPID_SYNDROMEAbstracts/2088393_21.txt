Both normal and autoimmune mice have IgM natural autoantibodies to bromelain-treated erythrocytes in which phosphatidylcholine (PTC) becomes exposed. At one stage this antibody may participate in the genesis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia in the NZB mouse. We have recently studied a patient with hemolytic anemia who had persistently high serum titers of IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) that were also demonstrated in a hemolysate of his erythrocytes obtained at the time of the anemia. We affinity-purified the antibody and sought its binding to normal human bromelain-treated erythrocytes (BrE) because of the IgM isotype of the antibody, since cardiolipin is not a constituent of the erythrocyte wall, and because the anionic phospholipids, with which aCL are known to cross-react, are not located at the outer leaflet of the erythrocyte membrane. We found binding of the antibody to HBrE in their hemolysates and by flow cytometry. We also demonstrated that the aCL cross-reacted extensively with PTC, as well as with other anionic or zwitterionic phospholipids. The purified IgM antibody lysed BrE in the presence of complement and also bound to in vitro-aged erythrocytes. Because this patient had no other evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus or any other autoimmune condition, his disease may represent a variant of the recently described primary antiphospholipid syndrome.
