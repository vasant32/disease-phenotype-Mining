In antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), there is a high prevalence of valvular heart disease which leads to increased risk of thrombo-embolic events, in particular, cerebrovascular events. We present a patient with cerebral infarction, previous deep-vein thrombosis, and miscarriages with positive lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies. Echocardiographic examination revealed mitral valve leaflet thickening and verrucous vegetations consistent with Libman-Sacks endocarditis, which is commonly associated with APS. In patients with combined Libman-Sacks endocarditis and antiphospholipid antibodies, anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is indicated due to high risk of valvular thrombus formation and subsequent embolization.
