The antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune hypercoagulability syndrome in which a wide variety of thromboembolic diseases may occur. Gastrointestinal manifestations associated with vascular occlusion include Budd-Chiari syndrome, hepatic and splenic infarction, pancreatitis, omental and intestinal infarction, and esophageal variceal bleeding due to portal vein thrombosis, but chronic mesenteric ischemia associated with mesenteric arterial thrombosis is very rare in this syndrome. We experienced a female patient with primary antiphospholipid syndrome with abdominal angina and splenic infarction associated with celiac trunk and mesenteric arterial thromboses. This is the first report describing chronic mesenteric ischemia and splenic infarction in a patient with primary antiphospholipid syndrome.
