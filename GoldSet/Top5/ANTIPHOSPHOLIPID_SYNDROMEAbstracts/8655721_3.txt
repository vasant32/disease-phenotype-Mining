Herpes gestationis shares many features with other bullous diseases, especially bullous pemphigoid. Treatments of benefit in bullous pemphigoid may also be effective for herpes gestationis. Cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and other immunosuppressive agents have been used successfully in refractory cases of bullous pemphigoid. We describe a patient with severe and persistent herpes gestationis in the postpartum period and the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, both of which were refractory to high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Treatment with pulsed-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide produced an excellent clinical response.
