The paper describes a clinical case of gluten-sensitivity celiac disease (GSCD) and recurrent lower extremity vein thrombosis in a female patient. According to the data available in the literature, GSCD is associated with increased risk for thrombosis. Hyperhomocysteinemia and protein S, folates, and vitamin B, 2 deficiencies may be responsible for thrombophilia in GSCD. Moreover, GSCD may be associated with antiphospholipid syndrome.
