Guidelines and diagnostic algorithms for the introduction of diagnostic procedures for connective tissue diseases have not yet been established and standardized. Diagnosis is often based on the patients's typical history, clinical symptoms and specific laboratory profiles. The use of diagnostic imaging procedures is relevant for differential diagnosis, for the assessment of disease activity and organ involvement, for defining the prognosis and monitoring responses to therapy and side effects. Experience with these techniques and diagnostic procedures, their application, indications and analysis represent the platform for rational and optimal diagnosis as well of defined therapy stratification.
