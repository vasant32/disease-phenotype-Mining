Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and HLA-DR antigens were determined in 314 central European patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Both HLA-DR4 and DR7 were increased in aCL-positive patients, and aCL were significantly associated with DRw53. The association between DRw53 and aCL was also apparent in those 17 patients with SLE and the anticardiolipin syndrome. There was no association between aCL and HLA-DQ or C4 alleles in SLE.
