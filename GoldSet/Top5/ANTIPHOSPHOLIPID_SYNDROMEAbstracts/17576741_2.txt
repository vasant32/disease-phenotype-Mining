The objective of this study was to analyse the prevalence and characteristics of the main clinical and immunological manifestations at the onset and during the evolution of the disease in a cohort of patients from Latin America (mainly of mestizo origin) and to compare the Latin American with the European patients. Clinical and serological characteristics of 100 APS patients from Mexico and Ecuador were collected in a protocol form that was identical to that used to study the ;Euro-Phospholipid' cohort. The cohort consisted of 93 female patients (93.0%) and seven (7.0%) male patients. There were 91 mestizos (91.0%), seven whites (7.0%) and two Amerindians (2.0%). The most common manifestations were livedo reticularis (40.0%), migraine (35.0%), inferior extremity deep vein thrombosis (32.0%), thrombocytopenia (28.0%) and hemolytic anemia (20.0%). Several clinical manifestations were more prevalent in Latin American than in European patients and they included mainly neurological (migraine, transient global amnesia, acute ischemic encephalopathy, amaurosis fugax) and cutaneous (livedo reticularis, skin ulcerations, superficial cutaneous necrosis, multiple subungual splinter hemorrhages) manifestations as well as hemolytic anemia. The APS has a wide variety of clinical and immunological manifestations at the onset and during the evolution of the disease and the ethnic origin in addition to environmental and socioeconomic factors can modify the disease expression.
