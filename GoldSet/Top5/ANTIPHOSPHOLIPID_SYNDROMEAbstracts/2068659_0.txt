The authors provide disease histories of 4 patients afflicted with genuine systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). There were 2 men and 2 women who developed acute transverse myelitis (ATM) at an age of 24 to 31 years. Before ATM developed, SLE standing was from 3 to 10 years. Based on the authors' and reported data, the problems of the pathogenesis, clinical picture, diagnosis and prognosis in that grave complication of SLE are discussed. As for the mechanisms of ATM development, the role of antiphospholipid antibodies is reviewed. The data on familial aggravation of the patients are presented in terms of the development of the antiphospholipid syndrome in their relatives. Emphasis is laid on the necessity of early intensive care with glucocorticoid hormones and cyclophosphamide of patients with associated SLE and ATM in order to improve their prognosis.
