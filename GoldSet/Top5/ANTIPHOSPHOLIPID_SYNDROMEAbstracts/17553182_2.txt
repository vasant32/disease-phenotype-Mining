We present the case of a 19-year-old woman who developed a nasal septal perforation and atrophic rhinitis following septal surgery. During the subsequent five years, she also experienced intermittent episodes of swelling and ischaemia of the left foot, as well as livedo reticularis. Ultimately, haematological investigations revealed the presence of lupus anticoagulant and elevated antiphospholipid immunoglobulin M levels. A diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (Hughes syndrome) was made.A search of the literature revealed that nasal septal perforation has been described in up to 0.8 per cent of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. However, it is undescribed in the otorhinolaryngological literature. The impact of this syndrome on otorhinolaryngology practice is examined.
