Sera from 20 patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), primary or secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or with SLE, were assayed by immunoblot analysis for anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies (abeta2-GPI), and by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) technique for reactivity with astrocyte and neuron cell lines and with histological sections of human brain biopsies and monkey cerebellum. Six sera from healthy donors were studied as a control. Eleven out of the 20 patient sera contained abeta2-GPI and were immunoreactive with astrocytes and neurons, both in culture and in the histological sections, and with the endotheliocytes of the microvessels present in the histological sections. Cell localization and the pattern of immune reaction were similar to those obtained with a monoclonal antibody abeta2-GPI. Eight of the remaining patient sera, found abeta2-GPI-, did not react with the nervous substrates (and the control sera), while one exhibited immunoreactivity analogous to the abeta2-GPI+ sera. The interference of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in the immunoreactivity with the nervous substrates was excluded since aCL were present in all patient sera and no immune reaction was observed in the histological sections incubated with a monoclonal aCL. Therefore, the binding of abeta2-GPI from patients to cells of the central nervous system (CNS) occurs independently from aCL. This issue may be relevant to further evaluate the potential pathogenetic role of abeta2-GPI in the CNS damage of APS-like conditions.
