There are few case reports on the association between autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and anticardiolipin antibodies (anti-CLAbs) and/or antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS). We studied the anti-CLAbs prevalence in AIH and other hepatic diseases. We also investigated whether anti-CLAbs are co-factor dependent and which is their avidity since co-factor dependency or increased resistance is associated with APLS. Fifty-nine AIH patients, 228 HCV, 50 HBV, 123 with other non-viral and non-autoimmune liver disorders (nV-nALD) and 267 healthy people were investigated for anti-CLAbs and antibodies against beta-2-glycoprotein I (anti-beta2-GPI). Resistance of IgG anti-CLAbs was evaluated using 2 M urea. IgG anti-CLAbs detected in 39% of AIH, 19.7% of HCV (p=0.006), 14% of HBV (p=0.01), 8.1% of nV-nALD (p=0.000) and 1.1% of healthy (p=0.000). IgG anti-CLAbs were associated with the presence of cirrhosis and active AIH while their resistance to urea was high. Anti-beta2-GPI was detected in two AIH patients. We demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of anti-CLAbs in patients with AIH compared to other diseases and healthy people. Anti-CLAbs were associated with AIH stage but no association was found with APLS clinical manifestations (thrombosis, pregnancy morbidity, thrombocytopenia). However, their avidity was comparable with that of APLS indicating the need for prospective studies in order to address whether anti-CLAbs in AIH may contribute to the progression of liver disease or APLS development.
