The antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterised by the clinical features of recurrent thrombosis in the venous or arterial circulation and foetal losses in combination with circulating anti-phospholipid antibodies in the blood of the afflicted patients. Over the last 25 years numerous studies have established the correlation between the presence of antibodies against anionic phospholipids and thrombo-embolic manifestations but how these antibodies cause thrombosis is still unclear. Most scientists now accept the fact that only a subset of the antiphospholipid antibodies has clinical relevance. Not antibodies to anionic phospholipids but rather antibodies to β2-glycoprotein I are thought to be the major cause for the pathological manifestations. β2-Glycoprotein I is a plasma protein without a known function and persons lacking β2-Glycoprotein I are completely healthy. Our challenge is to understand why auto-antibodies against such a dispensable protein are so common and how antibodies directed against a protein without obvious function can induce the severe clinical manifestations observed in this syndrome.
