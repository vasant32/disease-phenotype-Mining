OBJECTIVE: We have demonstrated a point prevalence of 26% renal artery stenosis in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and uncontrolled hypertension. We describe the effect of anticoagulation on blood pressure control and renal function. METHODS: We studied 23 patients retrospectively with renal artery stenosis (RAS). Fourteen received oral anticoagulation for more than 1 yr (target International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 3.0-4.5). Five patients had primary APS. Patients were divided into two groups based on their INR (< 3.0 and > or = 3.0). Nine patients had repeat magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or an angiogram of the renal arteries after 2 yr. RESULTS: Only 8/14 patients managed to maintain their INR > or = 3.0 (median INR 3.1, range 2.8-3.7) while six had a INR < 3.0 (median INR 1.9, range 1.2-2.4). Patients with a median INR < 3.0 had poorly controlled blood pressure and there was significant deterioration in mean serum creatinine values (Wilcoxon's test, P < 0.03). Nine patients underwent follow-up renal artery imaging. Three of nine patients with an INR < 3.0 (median INR 1.9) had re-stenosis and a fourth developed bilateral renal artery stenosis. Five patients with INR > or = 3.0 (median INR 3.1) did not show re-stenosis of the renal arteries; their renal function was stable and blood pressure was well controlled. One other patient with secondary APS (mixed connective tissue disorder) with INR > 3.0 showed recanalization of the stenosed renal artery. CONCLUSION: Anticoagulation with INR maintained > or = 3.0 helped to control the blood pressure and prevent the progression of renal disease.
