Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is characterized by the presence of repeated arterial and venous thrombosis, recurrent fetal loss and thrombocytopenia. Recently, renal involvement associated with APS is being increasingly recognized and discussed. In most cases, there has been a vascular nephropathy characterized by small vessel vaso-occulusive lesions associated with fibrous intimal hyperplasia of the interlobular arteries, thrombosis and focal cortical atrophy. We report a case of a 38-year-old patient with primary APS. Renal biopsies were performed three times in 26 years. Various glomerular and vascular lesions associated with APS were observed and discussed.
