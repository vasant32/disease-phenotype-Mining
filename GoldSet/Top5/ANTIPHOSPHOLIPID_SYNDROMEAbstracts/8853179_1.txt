We report a case of biopsy-proven polyarteritis nodosa (classic type in association with the antiphospholipid syndrome. Medium-sized arteriopathy was confirmed on visceral angiography. Elevated anticardiolipin antibodies were detected before initiating therapy with methylprednisolone and IV pulse cyclophosphamide. Rapid subsidence of symptoms correlated with a gradual normalisation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. After 6 months of therapy anticardiolipin antibodies were within normal limits. Only one similar case has been reported so far.
