We present a case of intestinal amoebiasis with subsequent development of antiphospholipid syndrome, manifested by deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) of IgM type at medium titer and aCL IgG antibody at low titer were determined during the days after the onset of infection. To our knowledge this is the first case of antiphospholipid syndrome associated with amoebiasis to be presented in the literature.
