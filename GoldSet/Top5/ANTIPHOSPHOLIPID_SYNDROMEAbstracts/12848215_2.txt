The presence of lupus anticoagulant has been implicated in venous as well as arterial thrombosis. We report here a 10-year-old boy who presented to us with hematemesis, malaena and splenomegaly. An ultrasound showed a recanalized portal vein with collaterals suggestive of portal vein thrombosis. He had grade IV esophageal varices. The liver function tests were normal. Investigations for prothrombotic factors showed that tests for PNH and for APC resistance were negative. Levels of anti-thrombin II and protein C were normal. There was a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time with a normal prothrombin time. Presence of lupus anticoagulant was confirmed with dilute Russell viper venom time and platelet neutralization test. Repeat tests after 10 weeks showed persistence of the lupus anticoagulant. ELISA test for anti-phospholipid antibody was negative. The association of lupus anticoagulant with portal vein thrombosis in the pediatric age group is very rare.
