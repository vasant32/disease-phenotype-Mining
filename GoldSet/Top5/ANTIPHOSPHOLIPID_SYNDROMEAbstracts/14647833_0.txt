OBJECTIVE: To describe an unusual case with clinical features of the antiphospholipid syndrome. DESCRIPTION: White child, two years and six months old, with renal failure, renal arterial thrombosis, and diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome was hospitalized with a history of abdominal pain, pallor, lethargy, and anuria for 36 hours. On physical examination, the patient showed malnutrition, high blood pressure, moderate edema, and hypochondrial pain. Laboratory findings included: urea=112mg/dl, serum creatinine= 4.5 mg/dl, blood pH= 7.47, blood bicarbonate= 12.8 mmol/L, K=7.2 mEq/L. Peritoneal dialysis was started and maintained for 11 days. After 7 weeks, the patient still needed anti-hypertensive drugs and the renal function was still abnormal. Renal biopsy was performed and revealed renal infarction. The result of Doppler ultrasonography revealed absent renal blood flow on the right side. Renal arteriography showed total occlusion of the right renal artery. Results for collagen diseases were negative. A right nephrectomy was performed and the blood pressure was controlled. The child was hospitalized again at 5 years and 8 months old with episodes of absence seizures and abdominal and precordial pain. Anticardiolipin antibody test was positive. The child is now 7 years old, asymptomatic, with negative anticardiolipin antibody, and has been under regular follow-up. COMMENTS: Children with arterial thrombosis should be investigated for a possible association with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome even in the absence of collagen disease.
