Antiphospholipid antibodies are commonly found in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or the antiphospholipid syndrome, and a subset of such antibodies is associated with prothrombotic events such as stroke and with adverse pregnancy outcomes and fetal loss. We examined sera from 411 patients who were clinically characterized as to their periodontal disease status for serum levels of beta2-glycoprotein I-dependent anti-cardiolipin autoantibodies (anti-CL). The prevalence of patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) and generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) positive for anti-CL (16.2% and 19.3%, respectively) was greater than that in healthy controls (NP) and localized aggressive periodontitis (LAgP) patients (6.8% and 3.2%). Patients with these autoantibodies demonstrated increased pocket depth and attachment loss compared with patients lacking the antibodies. Analysis of the data indicates that patients with generalized periodontitis have elevated levels of autoantibodies reactive with phospholipids. These antibodies could be involved in elevated risk for stroke, atherosclerosis, or pre-term birth in periodontitis patients.
