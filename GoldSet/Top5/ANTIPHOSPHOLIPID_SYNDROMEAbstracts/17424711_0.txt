 AIM: Analyze the clinical and evolutive particularities of Henoch Schonlein purpura in children METHODS: We studied retrospectively 122 cases enrolled in the pediatrics department of Sousse during 10 years period (1992-2001). RESULTS: It is about 66 boys and 56 girls (sex - ratio= 1.18) aged 3 to 13 years (mean age: 7 years and half). The diagnosis has been established clinically on the presence of cutaneous syndrome with symmetrical declivitous region purpura in all patients with articular syndrome (91cases) and/or digestive syndrome (65cases). Complications were variable: digestive hemorrhage (19 cases), occlusive syndrome (2cases), renal involvement at variable severity (56 cases), scrotal and testicular complications (11 cases), cardiac complications (tamponade in a case). Henoch Schonlein purpura was associated with a primary antiphospholipid syndrome in a case, renal tuberculosis in a case and cholestatic hepatitis A in another case. All patient receeved symptomatic treatment (rest in bed + / - antalgic treatment). Digestive rest was prescribed for 20 patients presenting severe abdominal pains with corticosteroid during 2 at 4 weeks (1-2mg/kg/d) in eight cases. Corticosteroid-cyclophosphamid association was prescribed for 2 patients with severe renal involvement; one of them benefitted of extra-renal purification. One or several relapses of Henoch Schonlein purpura were noted in 13 patients. All sick evolved favorably same those presenting renal or cardiac involvement (middle receding of 5 years).
