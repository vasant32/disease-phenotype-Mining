The impact of hypertension in the pregnancies from autoimmune patients is not unequivocally defined. We have prospectively followed 168 pregnancies from 135 patients from four Italian centres to verify the potential impact of hypertension in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The rate of preeclampsia, mean neonatal weight and gestational age at delivery were significantly lower in patients with both APS and hypertension than in patients with hypertension or APS alone. This information may be relevant for counselling and care of these patients.
