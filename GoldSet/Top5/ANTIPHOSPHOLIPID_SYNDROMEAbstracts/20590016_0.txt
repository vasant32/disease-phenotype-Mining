Antiphospholipid antibodies are correlated to antiphospholipid syndrome, that is characterized by one or more thrombotic episodes and obstetric complications. Some recent studies have evidenced as antiphospholipid antibodies can be correlated to an transitory hemorrhagic syndrome with prolonged aPTT. This syndrome compares 7-10 days after a bacterial or viral infection and it is characterized by a spontaneous regression into a period of three months. The aim of this paper is to evidence the pathogenesis and the clinical aspects of this syndrome.
