 OBJECTIVE: Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNt Abs) against HIV-1 are rarely produced during natural infection, and efforts to induce such Abs by vaccination have been unsuccessful. Thus, elucidating the nature and cellular origins of bNt Abs is a high priority for vaccine research. As the bNt monoclonal Abs (MAbs) 2F5, 4E10 and 2G12 have been reported to bind select autoantigens, we investigated whether these MAbs display a broader range of autoreactivity and how their autoreactivity compares with that of pathogenic autoAbs. METHODS: An autoantigen microarray comprising 106 connective tissue disease-related autoantigens and control antigens was developed and used, in combination with ELISAs, to compare the reactivity profiles of MAbs 4E10, 2F5 and 2G12 to those of four pathogenic autoAbs derived from patients with antiphospholipid-syndrome (APS), and to serum from a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RESULTS: The APS MAbs and SLE serum reacted strongly with multiple autoantigens on the microarray, whereas anti-HIV-1 MAb reactivity was limited mainly to HIV-1-related antigens. The APS autoAbs reacted strongly with CL, yet only 4E10 bound CL at high concentrations; both 2F5 and 4E10 bound their HIV-1 epitopes with a 2-3-log higher apparent affinity than CL. Moreover, the polyreactivity of 4E10, but not CL15, could be blocked with dried milk. CONCLUSION: The reactivity profiles of bNt anti-HIV-1 MAbs are fundamentally distinct from those of pathogenic autoAbs that arise from dysregulated tolerance mechanisms. This suggests that the limited polyreactivity observed for the bNt MAbs, and for HIV-1-Nt Abs in general, may arise through alternative mechanisms, such as extensive somatic mutation due to persistent antigen selection during chronic infection.
