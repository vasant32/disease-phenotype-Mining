Hepatic infarction is rare in hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome. We described a case of a 24-year-old woman who was admitted at week 17 of pregnancy with an antiphospholipid syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging was the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing hepatic infarction, guiding treatment, ensuring the early detection of bleeding, and monitoring liver recovery.
