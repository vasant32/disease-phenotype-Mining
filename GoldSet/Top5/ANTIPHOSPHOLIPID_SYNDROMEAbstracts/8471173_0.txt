There are some patients with a clinical picture that suggests to be a rheumatological problem. However, it does not have all the criteria to be accepted such as specific problems like systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, etc. Now we know that a relation between high levels of antiphospholipid antibodies exist in these special patients and the name of the disease is antiphospholipid syndrome. This problem can be primary or secondary. This disease has been studied mainly in adults with SLE an there is not a description of this syndrome in national pediatric literature. For this reason we present three clinical cases that permit us to review both forms of the syndrome. In this way we alert want to the pediatric community about this topic, and if the number of cases increases, it will improve the knowledge and prognosis of the patients at this age.
