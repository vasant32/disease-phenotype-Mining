Five patients presented with Sneddon's syndrome characterised by cerebral infarction, livedo reticularis, hypertension, epilepsy and a progressive dementia. Two patients had raised anticardiolipin antibody titres. The clinical symptoms and immunological disturbance in Sneddon's syndrome and the antiphospholipid syndrome are similar, and may indicate the importance of immune mediated thrombosis in Sneddon's syndrome.
