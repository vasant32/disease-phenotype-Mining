The aim of this study was to investigate two patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) who suffered from multiple repeated pregnancy losses of probably genetically impaired embryos. Sera from these patients contained high levels of IgG antibodies against cardiolipin, IgG and IgM phosphatidyl inositol, IgG phosphatidyl L-serine, and IgG against anti-annexin V. The conventional treatment of APS was ineffective. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) showed chromosomally impaired embryos. The course of pregnancies and deliveries were monitored due to the close collaboration of in vitro fertilization and PGD in early embryos. After the selection of normal embryos using PGD, and the treatment of APS, both patients became pregnant and delivered healthy babies. Without such selection, both women would probably have miscarried their embryos again.
