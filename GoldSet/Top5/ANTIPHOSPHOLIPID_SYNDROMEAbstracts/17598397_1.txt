The aim of the research was to show our diagnostic and therapeutic experience with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in pregnant women. 36 pregnant women suspect on APS were included in the study: 32 with primary antiphospholipd syndrome (PAPS) and 4 with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (SAPS). All pregnant women received low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH) and low dose aspirin (LDA) therapy. Control group represented 26 women with SAPS and previous bad reproductive anamnesis. Average pregnancy lasted 37.06 +/- 0.707 weeks. LMWH and LDA therapy was successful in 97.22%. Lupus anticoagulant (LA) was found to be more frequent in PAPS group (71.87%). Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) were found to be more frequent in SAPS (26.66%). For three patients (3.37%), PAPS was diagnosed due to a fact that they had positive antibeta2-glycoproteinl (antibeta-GP1). To make APS diagnosis, it is of great importance to search for all antiphospholipid antibodies. LMWH and low dose of acetylsalicylic acid should be the first choice therapy.
