Clinical and laboratory studies were carried out in 38 pregnant women with antiphospholipid syndrome. Increased functional activity of platelets and decreased protein-producing function of the placenta were observed starting from the early terms of gestation. These disorders were followed by the development of hypercoagulation in the plasma component of hemostasis, appearance of intravascular blood clotting markers, and inhibition of AT III and protein C. This led to the progress of disorders in the microcirculatory bed, fetoplacental insufficiency, decrease in trophoblastic beta1-glycoprotein level, chronic hypoxia, and fetal death. Infection accelerated this process. Measurements of trophoblastic beta1-glycoprotein every 2 weeks help to diagnose fetoplacental disorders, predict the course of pregnancy, and evaluate the efficiency of drug therapy.
