Many laboratories have established ELISAs for the the routine detection of anti-cardiolipin antibodies (ACA). Earlier studies had indicated that assay incubation at 37 degrees C may interfere with the antigen binding capacity of these antibodies. We have reexamined this phenomenon by comparing ACA titers obtained when incubations are performed at either 37 degrees C or at room temperature (RT). In addition, the effect of coating antigen in aqueous or organic solution was compared. The sera tested included a set of recognized ACA standards and samples from 19 patients with SLE, two with primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, 71 patients with a variety of autoimmune and non-autoimmune disorders and 210 blood bank controls. The results show that while some sera do perform better under either incubation temperature there was no correlation between ACA titers and incubation temperature on a population basis either for IgG or IgM isotypes. This was seen both for positive standards and patient sera. For IgG ACA a similar phenomenon was seen if the microplates were coated with cardiolipin either in sodium carbonate or ethanol. For IgM ACA there was a significant increase in ACA titers at RT when cardiolipin was coated in ethanol. The data suggest that for most sera neither the antigen coating medium nor the assay incubation temperature are important variables in the determination of IgG ACA. Factors contributing to the influence of either variable in individual sera could not be identified.
