A pregnant woman with lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid syndrome developed atypical hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome requiring preterm delivery. Her postpartum course was marked by persistent fevers eventually found to be secondary to myocarditis. The diagnosis of myocarditis was confirmed by cardiac magnetic resonance but was not apparent on echocardiography. The myocarditis resolved with steroid therapy.
