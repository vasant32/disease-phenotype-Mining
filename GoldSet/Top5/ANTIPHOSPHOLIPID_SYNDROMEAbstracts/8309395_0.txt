OBJECTIVE: To present a case of severe pre-eclampsia in which diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome was made after delivery, and to discuss pointers to the diagnosis. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 32-year-old woman in her second pregnancy presented at 32 weeks' gestation with severe pre-eclampsia. Her persisting severe postpartum illness was investigated. The presence of anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant led to the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: Induction of labour was successful, with delivery of a healthy baby girl. The patient made a full recovery after treatment with corticosteroids and warfarin. CONCLUSION: The antiphospholipid syndrome should be considered in cases of severe early pre-eclampsia.
