OBJECTIVES: The INNO-LIA ANA Update is a qualitative multiparameter line immunoassay for detection of autoantibodies to several different antigens associated with connective tissue disorders. We sought to optimize and validate the cut-off values for its antigen-specific components: SmB, SmD, RNP-70k, RNP-A, RNP-C, SSA/Ro52, SSA/Ro60, SSB/La, Cenp-B, Topo-I, Jo-1, ribosomal P, and histones. Our aim was to achieve 98% specificity for each of the markers, with respect to differential disease controls, while maintaining sensitivity. METHODS: For optimization, the cut-off value of the different antigen lines was fixed to achieve this specificity using an in-house set of 955 patient samples. Specificity was validated at multiple sites using a different set of 330 samples obtained from 158 apparently healthy blood donors, 100 patients with a variety of infections, 20 each with Wegener's granulomatosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and primary antiphospholipid syndrome, and 12 with psoriatic arthritis. Sensitivity was evaluated, using this optimized cut-off control, in 147 patients with scleroderma, 93 with Sj√∂gren's disease, 40 with systemic lupus erythematosus, 40 with rheumatoid arthritis, 39 with mixed connective tissue disease, and 19 with polymyositis. Sensitivity and specificity of the INNO-LIA ANA Update were determined using the clinical diagnosis as reference. RESULTS: The optimized cut-off values resulted in a specificity 98% or more for all LIA markers except one (histones 97.8%) in the validation set of 330 samples. The sensitivity for each marker tested in 378 samples from the target patient groups was comparable to that reported in the literature. CONCLUSION: The INNO-LIA ANA Update shows uniformly high specificities combined with sensitivities very similar to those of reference assays, in a single test format.
