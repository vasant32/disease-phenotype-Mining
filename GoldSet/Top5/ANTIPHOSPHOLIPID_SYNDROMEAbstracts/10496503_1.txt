Arterial reactivity leading to acute thrombosis at the site of a needle stick injury has never been described during antiphospholipid syndrome. The authors report a case characterized by a succession of thrombotic events occurring during or immediately after arterial angiographies or arterial surgery, in which catastrophic arterial reactivity can be strongly suspected. In this particular patient, it can be postulated that damage to the endothelial cells of the vessels injured during manipulation may have precipitated or aggravated the preexisting susceptibility to thrombosis.
