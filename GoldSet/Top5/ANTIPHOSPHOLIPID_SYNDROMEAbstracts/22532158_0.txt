Conventional therapy with aspirin and/or heparin is at times incapable of preventing complications in high risk pregnancies of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). In those cases, a so-called second-line treatment protocol is used in addition to conventional therapy strategies. This manuscript is a report on three APS pregnant patients who were successfully treated with plasma exchange (PE) (two cases) or with immunoadsorption (IA) (one case) as a second-line treatment strategy. The efficacy of these procedures in removing anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-β(2)glycoprotein I (aβ(2)GPI) antibodies from blood was evaluated. Serum samples were collected before and after 87 apheretic treatment sessions. Serum IgG/M aCL and IgG/M aβ(2)GPI antibodies were determined using an "in-house" enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and showed that all three patients had medium/high IgG aCL and aβ(2)GPI titers. All three women had a successful pregnancy. A significant decrease in IgG aCL (P = 0.0001) and aβ(2)GPI (P = 0.0001) antibody titers was observed after PE and IA sessions. There was moreover a significant, steady fall in serum IgG aCL pretreatment levels during the course of all three pregnancies (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0001, P = 0.001). The fall in IgG aβ(2)GPI was significant in two of the patients (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0001) both with high antibody titers, but not in one with medium antibody titers, who was treated with PE (P = 0.17).
