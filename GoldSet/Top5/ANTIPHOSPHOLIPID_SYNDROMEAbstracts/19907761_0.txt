Structural reorganization of endotheliocytes was studied on models of various pathological processes: placental dysfunction, glomerular pathology, vibration syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, and diffuse angiokeratoma, all of these characterized by endothelial insufficiency. Universal modification of endothelial associations was revealed. It included a chain of stereotypical reactions: from degeneration alternating with compensatory hypertrophy to subsequent atrophy and death of endotheliocytes. The time course of the process was confirmed by the results of light microscopy in combination with ultrastructural examination and by evaluation of the biosynthetic reactions by in vitro radioautography.
