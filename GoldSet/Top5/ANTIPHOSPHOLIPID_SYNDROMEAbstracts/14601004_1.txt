 BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular diseases are one of the most important complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The diagnostic imaging of neuropsychiatric SLE complications presents many problems. This study was undertaken to investigate cerebral blood flow char s and its reactivity to hypercapnia by means of acetazolamide test in SLE patients. METHODS: Brain SPELT studies using 99mTc-HMPAO were performed in 50 patients with SLE. Acetazolamide test was performed in 35 patients 3 days after the baseline study by means of repetitive scanning 20 min after i.v. injection of 1.0 g of acetazolamide. RESULTS: Significant interhemispheric hypoperfusion areas were shown in 76.3% of all patients, 83.8% symptomatic and 63.1 % asymptomatic. Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome showed multifocal perfusion deficits. The reaction of cerebral perfusion to acetazolamide was heterogenous and showed increase, decrease, no change or mixed reaction of baseline-study-found focal hypoperfusion. Acetazolamide test revealed hypoperfusion in two patients with normal baseline study. MRI scanning revealed cerebral lesions in 41 % of patients. CONCLUSIONS: CBF asymmetries in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with SLE are frequent. Regional CBF alterations seem to be different in patients with and without antiphospholipid syndrome. The part of the patients with SLE shows no or paradoxically inversed reaction to acetazolamide.
