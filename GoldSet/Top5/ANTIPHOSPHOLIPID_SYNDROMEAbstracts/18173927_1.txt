An asymptomatic thirty-eight-year-old female developed recurrent DVT at the latter end of her first pregnancy and in the puerperium. Blood tests revealed a moderately elevated ANF (1:640) with a speckled pattern, hyperglobulinemia, and antibodies to thyroid tissues. Two months postpartum, following neurological disturbances she was found to have a patent foramen ovale and had developed paradoxical emboli to the brain causing multiple arterial occlusions. However, she also had cerebral venous occlusions as well as deep venous thromboses and pulmonary emboli, indicating a generalised prothrombotic state. Abdominal ultrasound examination revealed the presence of tumour which, on surgical removal, proved to be an ovarian carcinoma. The only antiphospholipid antibodies detectable were antibodies to mitochondria Type M5 in moderately elevated titres.
