Many clinicians providing care and advice to patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), where the principal clinical manifestation is stroke, do so in the setting of an evidence base of mixed quality. Indeed, systematic studies have not particularly helped the practising clinician as they have been characterised by variable criteria used to select subjects, making it impossible to extrapolate to typical clinic patients. This has left us with a number of key questions, each of which attracts controversy in terms of patient management. In this review, these are posed as a series of questions with the answer, or lack of one, considered after each question. The review draws attention to the important questions that require answers for current primary and secondary prevention, as well as treatment of APS and stroke, and suggests a series of studies that are needed to clarify these issues.
