The paper provides the data available in the literature and their own findings of immunopathological impairments in the central nervous system, and spinal cord and polyneuropathies. The most detailed comparison of immunological and clinicotomographic changes is made in system lupus erythematosus. With this, a correlation is shown between peripheral vascular diseases (butterfly, capillarites, reticular livedo, Raynaud's syndrome), the levels of circulating immune complexes and local neurological abnormality. Particular attention is paid to the antiphospholipid syndrome. A relationship is found in patients with neurolupus and Sneddon's syndrome between cardiolipin antibodies and various (mainly vascular and ischemic) neurological syndromes as recurrent cerebral circulatory disturbances, episyndromes, etc.
