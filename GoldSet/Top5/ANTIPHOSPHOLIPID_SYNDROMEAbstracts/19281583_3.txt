We have described a modification of the B-Lynch uterine compression suture which is simple and effective. This technique apposes the anterior and posterior uterine walls, obliterating the cavity and thereby provides effective control of post-partum haemorrhage as a result of uterine atony. It comprises of vertical compression sutures and is distinct from B-Lynch and Haymen's suture by having an additional firm puncture just below the uterine fundus. This means that the suture is transfixed at the uterine fundus, thus eliminating the risk of the sutures sliding off at the uterine fundus.
