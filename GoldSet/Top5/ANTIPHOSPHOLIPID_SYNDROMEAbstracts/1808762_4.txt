We present two females with antiphospholipid antibody (APA) syndrome who came with adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), recurrent abortions and extensive deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Both cases were positive for lupus anticoagulant (LA), global antiphospholipid test (APA), and IgG, IgA, IgM APA antibodies. Seventeen other cases with documented lupus anticoagulant and various clinical associations were tested for APA IgG, IgA, IgM. Only two were positive for IgA as well as IgG and IgM APA. Thirty volunteer blood donors (24 males and 6 females, aged 19-35 years) were taken as a control group. One person was moderately positive for LA and showed low positivity for IgG APA. These data suggest that the presence of IgA APA may signify a severe disease. Further studies are needed to confirm this observation.
