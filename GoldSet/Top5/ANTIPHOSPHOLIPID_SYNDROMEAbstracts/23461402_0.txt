The following is a case report of a young man with antiphospholipid syndrome, present with a recurrent iliofemoral venous thrombosis and premature peripheral arterial disease. This case report highlights the high risk of recurrent thrombosis upon discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy, particularly in the presence of persistent spontaneously increased aPTT and a high antiphospholipid antibody titer. The case report also reviews the potential of endovascular treatment of iliac vein thrombosis and points out the good 24-month patency rates of stents implanted into the pelvic vein region.Key words: antiphospholipid syndrome - iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis - recurrent thrombosis - accelerated atherosclerosis - peripheral arterial disease.
