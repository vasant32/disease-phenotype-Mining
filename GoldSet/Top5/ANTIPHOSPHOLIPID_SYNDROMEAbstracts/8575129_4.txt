A 27-year-old Caucasian female, with a past history of recurrent spontaneous abortions, was admitted with pre-eclampsia at 26 weeks' gestation during her sixth pregnancy. She was previously known to have antiphospholipid antibodies since her fifth abortion, but had no clinical or serological evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus. A small-for-dates infant was delivered by emergency Caesarean section at 27 weeks for poor placental blood flow and fetal distress. She was transferred to the renal unit on the sixth post partum day with pulmonary edema, hypertension, disseminated intravascular coagulation and acute renal failure. Renal biopsy showed lesions compatible with thrombotic microangiopathy with diffuse glomerular necrosis. She was plasma exchanged and remained dialysis dependent for 7 months. Antiphospholipid antibodies were present in high titres and were the presumed cause of her acute renal failure. The patient now has stable renal function with a creatinine clearance of 30 ml/min for over two years. The late recovery of renal function is unique in the above circumstances.
