The purpose of the paper is to estimate clinical problems of the primary antiphospholipid syndrome in a woman presenting recurrent fetal losses, thrombocytopenia, thrombo-embolic disorders, presence of lupus anticoagulant factor and high titer of antiphospholipid antibodies in serum. Clinical anamnesis, physical examination and laboratory findings including kidney biopsy excluded the possibility of SLE as a cause of this syndrome. In the perspective of the next pregnancy prophylaxis against pregnancy complication is discussed.
