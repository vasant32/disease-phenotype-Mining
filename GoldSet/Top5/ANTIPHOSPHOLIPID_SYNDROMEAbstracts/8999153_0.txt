Antibodies to cardiolipin (ACL) were detected in 12 (35%) of 34 patients with tumors of the ovaries. 8 of 12 patients exhibited clinical signs of antiphospholipid syndrome, 9 (75%), 2 and 1 patients demonstrated isolated hyperproduction of IgG ACL, combined rise of IgG ACL and IgM ACL, IgM ACL, respectively. Most frequently ACL occurred in endometriosis of the ovaries and serous cystadenomas (50 and 60%, respectively). In 5 (42%) of 12 patients CA-125 antigen concentration was above the upper norm (35 U/ml), in 3 (25%) cases the level of CA 19-9 antigen was elevated. There were parallel changes of ACL concentration and tumor marker CA-125 before and after operation. Autoimmune origin of ovarian endometriosis is suggested.
