The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is characterized by arterial and venous thrombosis including hepatic veins. Although transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or liver transplantation have been considered for Budd-Chiari syndrome, treatment options for patients with complete obstruction of three hepatic veins including the junction with the inferior vena cava are limited. We describe a 27-year-old female, who suffered thrombotic obliteration of hepatic veins including the portion confluent with the inferior vena cava (Budd-Chiari syndrome) associated with marked ascites and liver dysfunction. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt using a Wall-stent (10 mm in diameter) between inferior vena cava and intrahepatic portal vein was performed. Intrastent coagulation and recurrence of thrombosis were prevented by combination therapy with warfarin potassium and ticlopidine hydrochloride. These treatments induced loss of ascites and improvement of liver function, and she has been able to resume daily life. The portosystemic shunt described above in addition to combination therapy with warfarin potassium and ticlopidine hydrochloride appeared to be one of the options for treating Budd-Chiari syndrome associated with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
