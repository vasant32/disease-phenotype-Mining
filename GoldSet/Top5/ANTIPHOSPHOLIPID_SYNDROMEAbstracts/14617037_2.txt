Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a severe complication in pregnancy that can lead to fetal death in the second or third trimester. As soluble HLA-DR (sHLA-DR) molecules are reported to be implicated in the etiology of pregnancy disorders and of autoimmune diseases, we studied sHLA-DR plasma levels in pregnant women with APS (n = 14) and in women with normal pregnancy (n = 15), in women with high-risk pregnancies such as preeclampsia (PE; n = 20) and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR; n = 10) and in fertile non-pregnant women (n = 29). The sHLA-DR levels of pregnant women were assessed during the third trimester, at labor, in the first week, and in the third month of puerperium. The results obtained were compared with soluble CD95 ligand (sCD95L), an important signal molecule in the apoptosis pathway. The sHLA-DR levels in pregnant women with APS were approximately three times higher (mean 1.48 +/- 0.15 microg/ml) during the whole observation period than in fertile non-pregnant women (0.54 +/-.06 microg/ml) and nearly double in women with high risk (PE, 0.91 +/- 14 microg/ml; IUGR, 0.94 +/-.21 microg/ml) and in normal pregnancies (0.74 +/- 0.13 microg/ml). Furthermore, sHLA-DR levels of pregnant women with APS were positively correlated with the serum concentration of anti-anticardiolipin immunoglobulin G antibodies. For sCD95L plasma levels, no substantial variations were found among the different groups above. In pregnant women with APS, however, sHLA-DR levels were positively correlated with sCD95L levels. Further studies should clarify the functional involvement of sHLA-DR molecules in the induction of CD95/CD95L-mediated apoptosis pathway that may play a crucial role in the pathology of pregnancies complicated by APS.
