Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and at least 1 clinical manifestation, most commonly vascular thrombosis or fetal loss. Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with multiple cardiac manifestations, including valve problems, thrombosis within cardiac chambers, and coronary artery thrombosis. We describe the case of a 46-year-old woman with recurrent coronary stent thrombosis who was found to have antiphospholipid antibodies. After successful coronary artery bypass graft surgery, the patient was kept on twice-daily injections of the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin and started on warfarin. Six days after surgery, she was discharged from the hospital in stable condition.
