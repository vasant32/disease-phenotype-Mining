The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by obstetric and thrombotic complications in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. It can happen in an isolated way or in association with diffuse connective tissue diseases, mainly systemic lupus erythematosus. The association of APS with Takayasu arteritis (TA) is rarely described in the literature. We described a case of primary APS in a female patient who developed obstruction in large-size arteries, in spite of the use of oral anticoagulant, and increase of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, suggesting TA. The favorable response to prednisone treatment and later to infliximab reinforced the diagnosis of TA. The present report illustrates the existence of APS associated to TA, whose recognition is very important once the therapeutic strategy is radically different.
