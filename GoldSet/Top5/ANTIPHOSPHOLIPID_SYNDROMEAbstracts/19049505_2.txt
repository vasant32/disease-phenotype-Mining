 BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown the association between antiphospholipid antibodies with epilepsy but there are no studies addressing the effect of seizure frequency, duration of epilepsy, epilepsy type and aetiology on the prevalence of these antibodies in well-evaluated refractory epilepsy. METHODS: Anticardiolipin, anti-beta2-glycoprotein I and antinuclear antibody levels were measured in 105 well-evaluated patients with refractory focal epilepsy. Clinical determinants included the patient history, electroclinical classification and high resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Patients with seizures during the month prior to sampling (recent seizures) had increased prevalence of immunoglobulin (Ig) G class anticardiolipin antibodies (29%) compared with healthy controls [13%; age-adjusted odds ratio (OR): 3.09, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.30-7.34] and patients with no recent seizures (11%; age-adjusted OR: 4.00, CI: 0.84-19.02). The patients with recent seizures had increased prevalence of moderate positive IgG class anticardiolipin antibodies (12%) compared with the controls (4%) and the patients with no recent seizures (0%; age-adjusted OR: 4.45, CI: 1.14-17.36). The prevalence of IgG class anticardiolipin antibodies was not associated with epilepsy type, duration or aetiology. CONCLUSION: The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies is associated with recurrent seizures in patients with refractory focal epilepsy. The measurement of these antibodies may be useful in evaluating the outcome of epilepsy.
