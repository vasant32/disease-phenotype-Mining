A 37-year-old patient with known systemic lupus erythematous, antiphospholipid syndrome and previous pulmonary embolism presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction while on adequate anticoagulation therapy. The patient was further evaluated with cardiac computed tomography. A small diagonal branch occlusion was the only coronary lesion present. A partially calcified right ventricular thrombus was incidentally found. Because of the small vessel size, cardiac catheterization was deemed unnecessary, and the patient was discharged with adjustment of immunosuppressive therapy and anticoagulation.
