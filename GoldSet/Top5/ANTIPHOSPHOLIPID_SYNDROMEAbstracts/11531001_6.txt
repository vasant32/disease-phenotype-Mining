The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is characterized by arterial or venous thromboses and recurrent foetal loss. It occurs as primary disease, but also in the context of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Whereas primary APS induces a thrombotic microangiopathy without significant inflammatory reaction, secondary APS in SLE is usually associated with vasculitis. Here we report a patient with APS who presented with acute diarrhoea and then developed a HELLP-like syndrome characterized by a spontaneous abortion, multifocal hepatic necroses and thrombocytopenia. Thereafter an acute flare of SLE with arthralgias, pleuritis, skin rash and glomerulitis occurred. Clinical amelioration was only achieved by combining curettage, anticoagulation and immunosuppression, a treatment taking into account the pathogenesis of HELLP-like disease, APS and SLE. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of APS associated with combined acute manifestations of these three syndromes triggered by a presumable intestinal infection.
