Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is defined as a combination of antiphospholipid antibodies, arterial and/or venous thrombosis, and, in women, recurrent fetal loss. The mechanisms underlying this prothrombotic tendency are unclear. Here we determined plasma levels of the angiogenic growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor (PlGF) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in 34 patients with APS (median age 40 years) compared with 180 healthy controls and with 80 age-matched deep-venous thrombosis patients in whom the diagnosis of APS had been excluded. All of the patients met updated APS criteria and two-thirds of them were triply positive for antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anti-beta2-glycoprotein I and anti-cardiolipin antibodies). Angiogenic cytokines were quantified at least 6 months after an acute thrombotic event. VEGF levels were similar in the patients and controls, but were significantly higher in the patients with arterial thrombosis than in the patients with venous thrombosis. Plasma levels of SDF-1 and PlGF were significantly elevated in the patients, regardless of the arterial/venous nature of the thrombosis. Together, these results suggest that APS is associated with an angiogenic process, but that the angiogenic signal differs between patients with arterial and venous thrombosis.
