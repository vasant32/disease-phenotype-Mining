The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic non-inflammatory and autoimmune connective tissue disease. ASP is characterized by formation of autoantibodies against cell membrane phospholipids which act as procaogulation factors. Association with recurrent pregnancy loss, intrauterine growth retardation, preeclampsia and placenta ablation makes ASP a serious perinatologic problem. The primary form can evaluate into lupus-like disease or full-symptomatic lupus erythematosus, both usually preceded by acute form of APS. In pregnant women this situation may present considerable diagnostic problems. The aim of this work was to present a patient with acute primary antiphospholipid syndrome during pregnancy and puerperium, which subsequently was diagnosed as systemic lupus erythematosus flare. Such progression is rare and, despite several previous reports, requires extensive explanations and research.
