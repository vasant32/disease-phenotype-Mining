INTRODUCTION: Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) cause thrombotic disease and recurrent pregnancy loss. Despite their name it is now clear that the antigen for most antiphospholipid antibodies is the phospholipid-binding protein beta(2) glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI). However, beta(2) glycoprotein I is only antigenic for antiphospholipid antibodies when the protein is immobilised on a suitable surface such as phosphatidyl serine. It has been suggested that antiphospholipid antibodies bind to beta(2) glycoprotein I on the surface of resting endothelial cells and this in turn leads to endothelial activation and the initiation of thrombosis. However, as phosphatidyl serine is absent from resting endothelial cell membranes, we questioned this hypothesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ability of human antiphospholipid antibody-containing sera and monoclonal antiphospholipid antibodies to interact with endothelial cells was examined using cell-based ELISAs employing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as the antigen. The expression of adhesion molecules in response to treatment with antiphospholipid antibodies was also measured by a cell-based ELISA. Activation of NF kappa beta was examined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). RESULTS: Neither monoclonal antiphospholipid antibodies nor human sera containing antiphospholipid antibodies bound to resting endothelial cells. In contrast, one monoclonal antiphospholipid antibody did bind to both activated and apoptotic endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Antiphospholipid antibodies do not bind to resting endothelial cells nor do antiphospholipid antibodies activate resting endothelial cells. Rather, an independent triggering event is required to activate endothelial cells and subsequently some antiphospholipid antibodies may then bind to the activated endothelial cells and initiate a thrombogenic process.
