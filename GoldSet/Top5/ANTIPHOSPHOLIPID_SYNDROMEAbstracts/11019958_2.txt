Beta 2-glycoprotein I plays a pivotal role in the binding of antiphospholipid antibodies to phospholipid in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. In this study the nature of the epitopes on beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta2-GPI) recognised by sera from antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) patients (n = 15) was investigated and compared to rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal anti-beta2-GPI antibodies. beta2-GPI was only recognised when bound to a high affinity binding support. The antigenic epitope on beta2-GPI recognised by all APS patients was also dependent on disulphide bond integrity. Digestion of beta2-GPI with elastase rapidly destroyed the epitope(s) on beta2-GPI recognised by antibodies in 91% of APS patients. The main cleavage occurred at tryptophan316-lysine317 in the fifth domain. Digestion with staphylococcal V8 protease resulted in a 50% reduction in antibody binding in 81% of patients and the cleavage sites mainly involved the first domain of the molecule. There was considerable variability in the recognition of six different species of beta2-GPI by serum from APS patients. The epitopes on beta2-GPI bound by APS sera appear conformationally determined in all patients but are quite heterogeneous in the regions of beta2-GPI that are recognised.
