It has already been shown that tetanus toxoid (TTd) hyper-immunization is a suitable experimental method for creating the animal model of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in BALB/c mice. The severity of APS pathology in BALB/c mice mainly correlates to the affinity of anti-β(2) glycoprotein I (β(2)GPI) antibodies. In this study we have investigated reproductive pathology induced in C57BL/6 mice by TTd hyper-immunization using a combination of different pretreatments (complete Freund's adjuvant or glycerol) and adjuvants (alhydrogel or glycerol). A decrease in fecundity was recorded in only C57BL/6 mice immunized with alhydrogel adjuvant, irrespective of the kind of applied pretreatment; it was associated with an increase in abundance of low affinity anti-β(2)GPI IgG antibodies and Th1 prevalence.
