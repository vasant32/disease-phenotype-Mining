The significance of antibodies to cardiolipin (anti-CL) remains uncertain in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CH-C). The main purpose of this study was to elucidate the clinical characteristics of patients with CH-C seropositive for anti-CL. The prevalence of anti-CL and clinical parameters associated with anti-CL in those patients were examined. Six of the 45 (13%) patients with CH-C had anti-CL. However, none of these six CH-C patients fulfilled the criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome. Serum triglyceride and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) levels in CH-C patients with anti-CL were significantly higher than those in CH-C patients without anti-CL. Serum triglyceride levels positively correlated with serum ApoB levels. CH-C patients with anti-CL had significantly more progressive hepatic fibrosis than those without anti-CL. The degree of 8-hydroxy 2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) expression in the liver tissue was more severe in CH-C patients with anti-CL than in those without it. However, the emergence of anti-CL in CH-C patients was independent of insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and iron overload. These findings suggest that the emergence of anti-CL is associated with oxidative stress and that CH-C patients seropositive for anti-CL have clinical characteristics of hypertriglyceridemia, which derives from the facilitation of ApoB synthesis, and progressive hepatic fibrosis.
