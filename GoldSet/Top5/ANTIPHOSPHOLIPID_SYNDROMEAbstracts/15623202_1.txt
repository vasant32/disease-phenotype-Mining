We describe an 18-year-old girl who presented with severe systemic lupus erythematosus with multiple organ involvement. The disease was further complicated by recurrent seizures and intracerebral left parieto-occipital bleeding that required neurosurgical treatment. Postoperative rebleeding occurred due to disseminated intravascular coagulation and platelet dysfunction. Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome was suspected, but could not be confirmed during follow-up. Additional treatment with plasmapheresis and intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide in combination with corticosteroids was started. Liquor drainage via a ventriculo-peritoneal (vp)-shunt was necessary because of a hydrocephalus malresorptivus. The patient's recovery was slow and incomplete (cachexia and amaurosis persisted). Follow-up was further complicated by an intraperitoneal vp-shunt cyst, which was initially treated conservatively, but finally had to be revised operatively.
