We report a case of 52-year-old woman with primary antiphospholipid syndrome who developed mitral insufficiency and chronic renal failure. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis was started preoperatively due to thrombocytopenia that was aggravated by hemodialysis. Mitral annuloplasty was performed since the mitral valve was not severely damaged. Her postoperative hemodynamics were stable, and anticoagulant therapy was controlled easily. She recovered from severe thrombocytopenia while on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Valvular heart disease is a well known feature of primary antiphospholipid syndrome, and there have been several reports about valve replacement in patients who had antiphospholipid syndrome with or without systemic lupus erythematosus. However, valve repair has been reported in only a few such patients. We believe that valve repair is better than valve replacement in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome because of its hypercoagulable tendency. In addition, it seems that continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is a suitable method for the perioperative management of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who suffer from chronic renal failure as well as thrombocytopenia, and require cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass.
