The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune thrombophilia, characterized by the presence of plasma antibodies against phospholipids, associated with recurrent episodes of venous and/or arterial thrombosis and gestational morbidity (especially recurrent miscarriage). We report the case of a young female patient diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) associated with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies for a long time, presenting with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) due to proximal thrombosis of the anterior descending artery as the first clinical complication of APS.
