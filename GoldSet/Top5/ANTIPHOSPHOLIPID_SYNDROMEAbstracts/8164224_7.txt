Scleroderma has not been described in association with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Only a single manifestation, that of large vessel arterial thrombosis, has been noted in patients with scleroderma and antiphospholipid antibodies. We describe the first case report of a patient with scleroderma and a "full house" for the APS. Clinical suspicion, appropriate investigation and early treatment may help limit the progression of the vasculopathy seen with this syndrome.
