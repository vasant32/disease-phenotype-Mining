In a prospective comparative study we screened 112 women with a past history either of pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, recurrent abortion, IUGR, IUFD or abruptio placentae, with no apparent aetiology and a demographically matched cohort of 106 women having a past history of uncomplicated pregnancy outcome for the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and their significance. In the former group, the prevalence of aPL ranged from 10-46.87% compared with 8.49% in the later group. In women with the presence of aPL, the incidence of pre-eclampsia, early onset pre-eclampsia and abruptio placentae were 25%, 14.58% and 18.75%, respectively. In the same group, the abortion rate was 25% and live-birth rate was 64.58% with IUFD rate of 10.42%. Fetal morbidity rates were also higher in the mothers with aPL positivity, the incidence of IUGR was 27.08% and oligohydramnios was 33.33% in them. All these complications were statistically significant when compared with those of aPL negative mothers.
