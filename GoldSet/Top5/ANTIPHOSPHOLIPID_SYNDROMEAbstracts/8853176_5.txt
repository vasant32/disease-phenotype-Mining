Widespread cutaneous necrosis as the catastrophic manifestation in antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) is rather uncommon. Even in the few documented cases, the extensive skin necrosis lesions have been stabilized and regressed with eventual healing utilizing pulse steroid therapy alone or in conjunction with further treatment with plasmapheresis. We describe one case of APLS associated with lupus-like disease. The young female suffered from widespread cutaneous necrosis of the lower legs and gangrene change in the digital end of hands and feet. This condition necessitated amputation of major lower extremities and digital amputation of both hands.
