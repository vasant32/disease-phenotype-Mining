This study concerns 20 patients with cerebrovascular disease in the course of oral contraception with estrogens/progestins. The assumption of oral contraceptives appears to be related to the cerebrovascular manifestations, which could be caused by alterations of the blood vessel walls or of the coagulative process induced by estrogens/progestins. The thrombogenic action of these substances could be enhanced by preexisting conditions such as protein C or protein S deficiency.
