Systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients typically experience Raynaud phenomena that is often complicated by digital ischemic lesions, gangrene, and digital loss. Other causes of peripheral ischemia, such as atherosclerosis, cryoglobulinemia, antiphospholipid syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, paraneoplastic syndromes, and hyperadrenergic endocrine conditions, may be masked in SSc patients. We present a woman with limited SSc who developed toe necrosis and acute coronary events as a complication of a previously undiagnosed pheochromocytoma.
