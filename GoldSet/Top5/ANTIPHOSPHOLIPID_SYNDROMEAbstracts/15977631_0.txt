In a 29-year old patient with a triad of symptoms arising from an abortion in conjunction with a thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, the suspicion of an anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) was confirmed through the detection of increased levels of antiphospholipid antibody. Because of the continued wish to have children, the patient received oral methyl prednisolone and therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin.
