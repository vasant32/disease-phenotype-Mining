The present study sought to determine whether the level of anticardiolipin antibodies in women with recurrent abortion differed from that in the general population. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for detection of anticardiolipin antibodies in a group of 26 patients defined as habitual aborters (at least three consecutive spontaneous abortions), and in a control group of 26 patients each of whom had had at least one live birth without pregnancy wastage. A high level of anticardiolipin antibody activity was detected among 19.23% of the habitual aborters but in none of the controls, indicating an association between anticardiolipin antibody level and habitual abortion.
