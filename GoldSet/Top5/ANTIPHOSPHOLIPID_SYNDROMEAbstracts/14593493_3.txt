Transverse myelitis is an uncommon but well-known neurologic complication of systemic lupus erythematosus, and antiphospholipid antibodies have been implicated as having a pathogenic role of myelopathy in primary and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. Transverse myelitis usually is monophasic, but recurrent transverse myelitis was reported in association with systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and spinal arteriovenous malformations. It has been reported extremely rarely in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Herein we describe a patient with both conditions and propose that recurrent transverse myelitis should be included as a very rare feature of primary antiphospholipid syndrome.
