Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) were affinity purified or isolated in the IgG fraction of serum from 6 patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Anticardiolipin antibodies from one patient consistently compromised murine pregnancy. However in 92% (45 of 49) of cases injection of human anticardiolipin antibodies had no adverse effect on murine pregnancy, regardless of whether affinity purified aCL or IgG fractions were used. It is concluded that in most cases human anticardiolipin antibodies alone do not induce murine fetal loss.
