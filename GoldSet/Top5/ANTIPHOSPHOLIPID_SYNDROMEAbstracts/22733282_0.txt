Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) from immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Here we present successful management of ITP with anti-phospholipid antibodies, complicated by acute coronary syndrome (ACS), using CT coronary angiography (CTCA). The therapy for ITP may be changed for APS if ACS was thromboembolic event. As coronary angiography is thought to be very dangerous for patients with severe thrombocytopenia, noninvasive CTCA was desirable for our patient. Since no occlusion or narrowing was observed in CTCA, she has been safely treated as ITP with immunosuppressive agents throughout the course without antiplatelet or antithrombin therapy.
