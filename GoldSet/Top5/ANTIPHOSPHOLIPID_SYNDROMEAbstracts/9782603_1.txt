A 22 year old male patient with antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome (APL) developed severe bilateral avascular necrosis of both femoral condyles. Extensive synovectomy and arthrolysis in combination with an arthroplastic remodeling of both knee joints resulted in reduction of pain and joint effusion. Therefore, synovectomy and arthroplastic remodeling might be a promising therapy to extend the period of time to prosthetic joint replacement in young patients with APL.
