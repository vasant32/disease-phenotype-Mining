We describe a 43-year-old Caucasian man who, after a 10 year history of recurrent deep vein thromboses and pulmonary emboli, was found to have a "lupus anticoagulant" and marked elevation of antibodies to cardiolipin. He subsequently developed skin and buccal pigmentation and biochemical investigations revealed the presence of Addison's disease. The relationship of the Addison's disease to the recurrent thrombotic events in the presence of antibodies to phospholipids is discussed.
