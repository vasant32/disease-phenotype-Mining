Fewer than 80 cases of intracardiac thrombosis and intraoperative pulmonary thromboembolism during liver transplantation have been described. We present a patient who suffered an intraoperative fulminant intracardiac and aortic thrombosis and posthumously was found to have had high anticardiolipin immunoglobulin M concentration and markers of hyperfibrinolysis in preoperatively collected plasma. Hemostatic therapy in the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies and the pathogenesis of a catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome are discussed.
