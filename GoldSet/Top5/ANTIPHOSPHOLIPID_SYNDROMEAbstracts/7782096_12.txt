The (NZW x BXSB)F1 (W/BF1) mouse is known to be an animal model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). These mice produce not only anti-DNA antibodies but also anti-platelet antibodies, resulting in decreased platelet counts. They show a high level of proteinuria, increased white blood cell (WBC) counts, hypertension, and myocardial infarction due to the high levels of anti-cardiolipin antibodies. When W/BF1 mice (4-5 months) were lethally irradiated and then reconstituted with T cell-depleted bone marrow cells of normal BALB/c mice (8 weeks), 60% of the mice survived more than one year. The WBC and platelet counts in the mice were normalized, and the levels of anti-DNA and anti-platelet antibodies decreased. The renal dysfunction was also ameliorated as indicated by a lower level of proteinuria, lower levels of serum creatinine (S-CRTN) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and by improved histology. The blood pressure (BP) of the treated W/BF1 mice decreased due to the improved renal functions. In contrast to the non-treated W/BF1 mice which died of myocardial infarction or renal failure by the age of 7 months, the treated W/BF1 mice showed no evidence of myocardial infarction even one year after BMT. This was due to the lower cardiolipin levels.
