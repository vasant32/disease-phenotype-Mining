A 41-year-old male patient presented with veiled vision which had appeared only a few hours previously. Funduscopy revealed a retinal edema due to venous stasis retinopathy. A previous history was unknown except for an uncorrected arterial hypertension. A retinal vein thrombosis and macula edema developed in the affected eye. An antiphospholipid antibody syndrome was diagnosed which was treated with anticoagulants.
