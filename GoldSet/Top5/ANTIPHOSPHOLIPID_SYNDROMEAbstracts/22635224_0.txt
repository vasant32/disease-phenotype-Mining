Our objective was to study acquired Activated Protein C (APC) resistance in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) using a thrombin generation based assay. We compared patients with and without lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE). A parameter summarizing APC inhibition of thrombin generation with increasing APC concentrations (IC(50)-APC) was increased in all patient groups compared to controls: median values were 15.3 (interquartile range, IQR, 9.7 to 34.0) in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), 27.3 (IQR 23.5 to 43.5) in patients with SLE without APS, 64.1 (IQR 25.9 to 65.0) in patients with SLE/APS compared to 10.4 [IQR 8.5 to 15.8] in controls, respectively p = 0.003, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0001. In conclusion, patients with SLE and primary APS displayed a hypercoagulable state characterized by APC resistance.
