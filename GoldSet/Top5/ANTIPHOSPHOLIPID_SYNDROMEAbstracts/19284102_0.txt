The paper describes the first experience in using multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). In the latter, thrombogenesis is mosaic in most cases so the techniques providing a spatial imaging of the pathological process is of interest in the examination of patients with this disease. These techniques include mfERG. The quadrant mfERG analysis that reveals pathological changes in relation to the vascular involvement area is of the greatest informative value in patients with APS-associated retinal vascular occlusions.
