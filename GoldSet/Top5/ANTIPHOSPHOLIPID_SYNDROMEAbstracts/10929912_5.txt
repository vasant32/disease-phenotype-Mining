Portal venous decompression with transjugular intra-hepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a new approach in the treatment of Budd-Chiari syndrome. We report on a 31-year-old female with Budd-Chiari syndrome due to anti-phospholipid antibodies with compression of the inferior vena cava treated with TIPS and stenting of the inferior vena cava. TIPS was complicated by massive intra-hepatic haematoma which was managed conservatively. Treatment options and pathogenic mechanisms of Budd-Chiari syndrome under the rare coincidence of aplastic anaemia and anti-phospholipid syndrome are discussed. TIPS may be considered for venous decompression in Budd-Chiari syndrome, but physicians should be aware of potential TIPS' complications in these patients.
