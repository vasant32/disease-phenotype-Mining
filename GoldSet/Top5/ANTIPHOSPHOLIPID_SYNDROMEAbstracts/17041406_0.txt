Thrombotic events account for significant morbidity and mortality among patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. The cornerstone of management includes long-term anticoagulation. However, the benefit of long-term anticoagulation must be weighed against the risk of bleeding complications. This article presents the case of a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome who experienced severe intramuscular hemorrhage as a complication of warfarin anticoagulation. This case emphasizes the importance of careful monitoring of anticoagulation treatment, and of recognizing a new differential diagnosis when dealing with a painful, swollen calf in the setting of lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome.
