 INTRODUCTION: Thrombotic events, particularly pulmonary embolism, are well known presentations of the antiphospholipid syndrome. Other pulmonary manifestations of the disease like alveolar haemorrhage are rare but can represent a catastrophic aspect of this disease. Alveolar haemorrhage in this context is important to recognize since it can be either a complication of anticoagulation therapy or a manifestation of the disease. The therapeutic implications are then very different. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a woman with massive pulmonary embolism treated with thrombolytic therapy. This was complicated by alveolar hemorrhage initially attributed to thrombolytics and recurrent bleeding considered to be a manifestation of the antiphospholipid syndrome. The complicated course necessitated a protracted stay in the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and treatment with intravenous corticosteroids and plasmapheresis. CONCLUSION: Alveolar haemorrhage associated with the antiphospholipid syndrome can be catastrophic and require prompt and aggressive therapy. Plasmapheresis, usually reserved for the catastrophic aspects of this condition, was felt to be useful in this case.
