Antibodies to factor XII (FXIIabs) have been demonstrated in some patients with the anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS). The presence of these antibodies were shown to lead to statistically significantly reduced levels of FXII (p = 0.02). In an extension to this study forty female patients with either primary APS (n = 26) or systemic lupus erythematosus (APS positive) (n = 14) were investigated for levels of factor XII, the presence of lupus anticoagulant and antibodies to cardiolipin, beta 2-glycoprotein I and factor XII. Twenty one of the forty patients had a history of foetal loss (> 2, mean = 2.6). Lupus anticoagulant positivity showed a weak association with foetal loss (odds ratio = 1.1). While there was no association between the presence of antibodies to cardiolipin or beta 2-glycoprotein I with foetal loss, antibodies to factor XII showed a strong and statistically significant association (odds ratio = 5.4, p = 0.025).
