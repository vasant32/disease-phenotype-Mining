The aim of the study was to try thrombo ASS in combined therapy of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), to evaluate its efficacy in prevention of recurrent vascular defects. Thrombo ASS tablets (50-100 mg) were included in combined treatment of 45 patients with APS (6 males and 39 females, mean age 36.1 +/- 11.7 years, mean APS duration 10.2 +/- 9.0 years) and 8 patients with SLE (1 male and 7 females) matched for age. Antiphospholipin antibodies and clinical status were assessed before treatment and after the treatment within 9 months. It was found that addition of thrombo ASS to combined treatment of APS improves coagulation and microcirculation due to effective muscular blood flow, increases number of platelets in peripheral blood. Tablets covered with coating resistant to gastric juice reduce frequency of gastric side effects.
