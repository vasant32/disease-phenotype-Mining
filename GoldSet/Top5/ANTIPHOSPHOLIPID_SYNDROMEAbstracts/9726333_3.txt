OBJECTIVE: Ischemic stroke is the most common neurological manifestation in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Pregnancy in APS patients markedly increases the risk of thrombosis. There is no data on pregnancy outcome in patients with APS with a history of an ischemic stroke. We report our experience with three APS patients with a history of stroke who had successful pregnancies and deliveries. PATIENTS: Three patients with APS and previous stroke were treated with small doses of aspirin and anticoagulants during pregnancy. RESULTS: The patients remained free of attacks of cerebral ischemia during their pregnancies and at follow-up periods of 1 to 4 years. CONCLUSIONS: Successful pregnancy and delivery is possible in APS patients with a history of stroke, treated with low-dose aspirin and anticoagulants. A previous episode of cerebral ischemia should not be considered an absolute contraindication for an APS patient to become pregnant.
