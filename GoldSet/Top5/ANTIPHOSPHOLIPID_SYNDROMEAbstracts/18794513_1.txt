BACKGROUND: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a prothrombotic condition characterized by recurrent vascular thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity in the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is a prominent feature of APS, and many neurological manifestations have been described in published reports. There are limited data on psychiatric syndromes occurring in association with APS, and there have been no previous reports of mania associated with APS. METHOD: The authors present the case of a 31-year-old man who experienced an acute manic episode in association with APS. They review the literature on psychiatric manifestations of APS, discuss potential mechanisms of CNS pathogenesis, and consider diagnostic and treatment implications of the co-occurrence of APS and psychiatric symptoms.
