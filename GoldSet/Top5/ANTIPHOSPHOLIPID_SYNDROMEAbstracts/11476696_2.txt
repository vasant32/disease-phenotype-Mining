PURPOSE: To present a dramatic case of simultaneous bilateral central retinal vein occlusion associated with leukemia and anticardiolipin autoantibodies. METHODS: Interventional case report. Clinical examination, fluorescein angiography, B-mode ultrasonography, and laboratory serologies were performed on a 65-year-old man with chronic myelogenous leukemia who presented with sudden onset of decreased vision in his right eye. RESULTS: Fundus examination disclosed a nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion. Over the next 3 weeks, a nonperfused central retinal vein occlusion developed in both eyes and subsequent neovascular glaucoma developed in his left eye. Throughout this time, his white blood cell and platelet counts remained normal and his serum viscosity remained low, but anticardiolipin antibodies were increased. CONCLUSION: This case reveals the occurrence of simultaneous bilateral central retinal vein occlusion associated with anticardiolipin antibodies in leukemia and suggests an additional mechanism other than hyperviscosity for bilateral central retinal vein occlusions in leukemic patients.
