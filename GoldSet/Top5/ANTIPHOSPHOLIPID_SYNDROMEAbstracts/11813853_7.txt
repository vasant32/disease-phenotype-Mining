We report a 48-year-old man with thrombosis of the portal and superior mesenteric vein and inferior vena cava associated with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Primary APS was diagnosed by a positive reaction with anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) and the absence of any evidence suggesting the presence of other disease states known to be associated with aCL. A coeliac angiography showed obstruction of the portal and superior mesenteric vein with prominent collaterals and cavernous transformation. Femoral vein angiography showed total obstruction of the external iliac vein and inferior vena cava, and dilation of the pelvic veins, with contrast medium in the lumbar vein. This case is noteworthy as a report of primary APS accompanied by extensive abdominal and pelvic venous thrombosis.
