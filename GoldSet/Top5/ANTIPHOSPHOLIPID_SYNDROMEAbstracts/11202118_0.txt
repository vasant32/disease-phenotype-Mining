The authors detected lupus anticoagulant and/or anticardiolipin antibodies in 1519 patients' blood samples between 1986-1999 in 3rd Department of Internal Medicine of Medical School of Debrecen. Examining only the proved thrombotic events and fetal losses as symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome 218 patients had suffered from this syndrome. Secunder antiphospholipid syndrome was the diagnosis in case of 420 patients, the most common in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (288 patients). In 704 antiphospholipid antibody positivity cases the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome was not fulfilled. Analysing the antibodies profile of primary and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome in SLE, IgG type anticardiolipin antibody positivity was significantly higher in blood samples of SLE patients (82 patients, p < 0.01). Among thrombotic manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome cerebrovascular thrombosis were significantly higher in patients suffering from SLE (128 patients, p < 0.04), while the occurrence of venous thrombosis, thrombosis of coronary, carotic, aorta and peripheral arteries and recurrent abortions was not significantly different in case of primary and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. Lupus anticoagulant positivity means higher risk for venous thrombosis (94 patients, p < 0.0001), but anticardiolipin antibody positivity associated with a higher risk for thrombosis of coronary, carotic, aorta and peripheral arteries (59 patients, p < 0.00006). Comparing IgG- and IgM-type anticardiolipin antibody positivity the authors found significantly higher cerebrovascular thrombosis events in IgG-anticardiolipin group (p < 0.004). Sneddon syndrome were detected in 17 patients in the primary antiphospholipid syndrome group and in 16 cases in secundary, SLE-associated antiphospholipid syndrome group. One of the patients had died because of the Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome.
