Cerebrovascular accidents are rare but well documented in patients with Crohn's disease. Up to 10% of hypercoagulable state manifestations reported in association with inflammatory bowel disease are ischemic strokes. However, no clear mediating factor has thus far been suggested. A 44-year-old woman with Crohn's disease for 25 years developed a left temporal stroke associated with anticardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant suggesting antiphospholipid syndrome. A thorough evaluation did not reveal any other risk factor for ischemic stroke. No possible sources of emboli were found in the carotids and heart, and no deficiencies of protein C and activated protein C, protein S, and anti-thrombin III leading to hypercoagulable state were present. There may be a possible association between antiphospholipid syndrome and hypercoagulable state in Crohn's disease.
