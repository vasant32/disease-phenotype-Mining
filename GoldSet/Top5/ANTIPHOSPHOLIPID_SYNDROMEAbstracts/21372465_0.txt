A 26-year-old woman with a history of mild mental retardation, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura developed severe thrombocytopenia with Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a fresh cerebral infarction in the left precentral gyrus. ADAMTS-13 deficiency caused by an inhibitor and anti-cardiolipin antibodies were detected in the blood. After treatment with prednisolone and fresh frozen plasma, ADAMTS-13 activity was normalized, the ADAMTS-13 inhibitor had disappeared and the thrombocytopenia with a bleeding tendency was improved. To our knowledge, this is the first case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura caused by ADAMTS-13 deficiency associated with antiphospholipid antibodies and CMT.
