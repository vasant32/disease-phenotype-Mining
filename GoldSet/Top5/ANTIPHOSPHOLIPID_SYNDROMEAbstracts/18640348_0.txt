The antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by arterial and venous thrombosis and is associated with the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. Arterial thrombosis can result in myocardial infarction, which may potentially lead to end-stage heart failure. Here we report our anticoagulation protocol for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome that undergo axial-flow left ventricle assist devices (HeartMate II; Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) implantation.
