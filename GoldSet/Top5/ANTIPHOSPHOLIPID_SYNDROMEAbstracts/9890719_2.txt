We report a 22-year-old man who successfully underwent coronary stent implantation after an acute myocardial infarction. Lupus anticoagulant and antibodies against cardiolipin and prothrombin were detected despite the absence of any underlying disease. Therefore, long-term oral anticoagulation was instituted and appeared to be effective. To our knowledge this is the first report on coronary stenting in primary antiphospholipid syndrome.
