 BACKGROUND: To determine and characterize the prevalence of cerebral changes on MRI in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) within systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Seventy-one patients with SLE were prospectively studied with brain MRI: 32 with definite APLS and 39 without. Atrophy, ventricular enlargement, leukoaraiosis, interuncal distance, Evans' index, infarcts, and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) were analyzed. Demographic data, treatment, and SLE activity were analyzed. RESULTS: Groups were similar in age (32.4 vs. 32.8 years old; P= non-significant [NS]), and gender. Duration of disease was longer in patients with APLS (87.3 vs. 55.4 months; P= .064). Cortical atrophy was common in both groups (68.7% vs. 89.7%; P= NS). Leukoaraiosis was present in only 3 patients (9.4%; P= .08), all in the APLS group. WMH were found in more than 40% of the patients from both groups. Infarcts (21.9% vs. 2.6%; P= .019) and infarcts plus WHM (12.5% vs. 0; P= .037) were more common in patients with APLS. CONCLUSIONS: Although a higher prevalence of neurological involvement in SLE has been reported in APLS patients, we found gross brain changes to be similar between groups. Strokes and leukoaraiosis were more common in the APLS group, consistent with the idea of an APLS-induced prothrombotic state.
