A 22-year-old woman with known SLE and chronic hepatitis B developed anginal pain. During this period there was serologic but no other clinical evidence of active SLE. Myocardial perfusion SPECT showed a severe reversible perfusion defect in the posterior wall, and coronary angiography revealed multiple coronary aneurysms in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex artery and total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery. This case suggests that coronary aneurysms and total occlusion may represent a sequela of arteritis, or of a combination of underlying vasculitis and a recent thrombotic obstruction due to antiphospholipid syndrome.
