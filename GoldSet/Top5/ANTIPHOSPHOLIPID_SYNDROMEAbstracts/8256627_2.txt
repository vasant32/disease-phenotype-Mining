Anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) are concerned with many central nervous system diseases in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, no report has described the relationship between aseptic meningitis and aPL in SLE. We report a case of SLE with aPL, presenting cerebral infarction and aseptic meningitis. A 14 year old female with SLE with aPL experienced cerebral infarction and recurrent aseptic meningitis. Combination therapy with steroids and aspirin improved the condition and prevented relapses. The aPL are associated with cerebral infarction, even in young patients with SLE. In addition, aPL may induce aseptic meningitis in SLE.
