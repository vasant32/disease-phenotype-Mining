Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is characterized by recurrent thrombosis with the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. A diagnosis of APS requires the presence of at least one clinical and one laboratory criteria (detection of aCL IgG or IgM antibodies or the presence of lupus anticoagulant on two or more consecutive occasions 6 weeks apart). A severe, rapidly progressive form characterized by clinical involvement of at least three different organ systems with histopathological evidence of small and large vessel occlusion is termed catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. Early recognition of APS is crucial since aggressive management can result in a favorable outcome. We present the case of a 12-year-old boy who presented with a devastating illness with multiple thrombotic episodes and rapidly progressive renal failure.
