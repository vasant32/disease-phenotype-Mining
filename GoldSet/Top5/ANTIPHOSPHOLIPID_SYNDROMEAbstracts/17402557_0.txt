Antiphospholipid antibodies consist of a group of heterogeneous autoantibodies against anionic phospholipids. We describe the case of a 19-year-old patient who was consulted in the obstetrics service after her second miscarriage. She was a smoker and six months after this consultation she developed diabetes mellitus. At 21 years of age she suffered from myocardial infarction, when high anticardiolipin antibody levels were evidenced. Some months later the patient again became pregnant and prophylaxis against miscarriages was performed using low doses (5000 IU) heparin administered subcutaneously at 12-hour intervals. She evolved with preeclampsia, however, the baby was born in good health. One year after she again became pregnant and prophylaxis against miscarriage was again performed using low doses of heparin. The pregnancy successfully resulted with the birth of her second child.
