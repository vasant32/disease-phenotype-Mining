 AIM: We audited indications and outcomes of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) screening in the pregnant population at our centre. METHOD: Prospective and observational. All APS test results returned were audited for validity of indication and subsequent outcome. RESULT: 24 of a total of 146 (16%) of requests for the antiphospholipid antibodies and lupus anticoagulant were not indicated. Two positive results returned for a total of 116 "indicated" requests (1.7%). CONCLUSION: There needs to be increased awareness among obstetricians on the indications for screening for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The prevalence of antiphospholipid syndrome with obstetric manefestations in the study population is lower than rates published in the literature.
