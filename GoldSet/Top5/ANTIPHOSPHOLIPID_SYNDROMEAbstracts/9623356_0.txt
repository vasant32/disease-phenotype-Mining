Clinical manifestation and immunoserological features of secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (SAPS) were analyzed in this paper in 107 patients with systemic connective tissue diseases. In the group of patients with confirmed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) were positive in 43/93 (46.23%), while in 50/93 (53.76%) they were negative. Among aPL positive patients, 33/43 (76.74%) had clinical manifestations of SAPS, while 10 patients (23.26%) were without any clinical manifestations. The most frequent manifestations of SAPS associated with SLE were: arteriovenous thrombosis in 20/43 (46.51%), thrombocitopenia in 15/43 (34.88%) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia in 7/43 (16.27%). In our patients, rare manifestations of SAPS associated with SLE were recurrent fetal loss (1 case), livedo reticularis (1 case), transversal myelitis (2 cases), neuropathy (2 cases) and aseptic endocarditis (Libman-Sacks) (5 cases). Among 7 patients, with Sjögren's syndrome, clinically manifested SAPS was observed in 2, while in other 5 only increased aPL levels were found, as well as in patients with systemic vasculitis-3, MCTD-2 and Sy. Sjögren with vasculitis-1. One RA patient had thrombosis of v. cava inferior. In majority of patients with clinically present SAPS the levels of both examined immunoglobulin isotypes (IgG + IgM) were decreased-21/40 or 52.5%, while isolated increase of IgG was found in 14 (35%) and isolated increase of IgM in 5 (19.22%) patients. In three out of five patients with Libman-Sacks only LA test was positive. This investigation have shown that arterial and venous thromboses are the most common manifestations of SAPS in SLE. Every blood vessel may be involved (from arteriolae to the aorta and from postcapilar venules to the v. cava).
