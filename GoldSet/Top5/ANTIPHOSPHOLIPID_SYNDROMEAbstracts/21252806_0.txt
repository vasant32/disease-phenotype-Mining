 BACKGROUND: Shrinking lung syndrome is characterized by pulmonary compromise secondary to unilateral or bilateral paralysis of the diaphragm. CASE: Shrinking lung syndrome was diagnosed in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome after a cesarean delivery at 28 4/7 weeks of gestation. Signs and symptoms included unexplained right-side chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, and absent breath sounds at the right base of the lungs. After initiation of corticosteroids, her symptoms resolved. CONCLUSION: Although seen in association with systemic lupus erythematosus, shrinking lung syndrome has not been described with antiphospholipid syndrome or during pregnancy. Diagnosis and awareness are important because treatment with moderate- to high-dose corticosteroids appears to improve the clinical outcome.
