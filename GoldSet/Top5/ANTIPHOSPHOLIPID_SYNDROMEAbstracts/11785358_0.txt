Object of the study are women with a history of unexplained recurrent embryo, fetal and early neonatal death, severe preeclampsia, fetal growth retardation, abruptio placentae, puerperal thromboses. Quite often placental insufficiency is linked to abnormal vascular system and hemostatic disturbancies. In about 65% of the women with a complicated and in 18% of the women with a normal pregnancy are observed different genetic anomalies that lead to a hypercoagulative state. A major place is taken by the Leiden mutation of hemostasis factor V, by protein C and protein S deficiency, etc. Another disease that leads to arterial and venous thromboses and is most often linked to recurrent miscarriage is the antiphospholipid syndrome. Many authors confirm the findings of large placental infarctions and thromboses in women who are positive for antophospholipid antibodies.
