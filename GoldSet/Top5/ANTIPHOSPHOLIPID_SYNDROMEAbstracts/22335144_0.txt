A case report of young woman diagnosed as having microscopic polyangiitis (MPO) presenting with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). DAH is a rare, but life-threatening disorder. The patients presented with dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis (not constant). The radiographic features are very characteristic and reveal the signs of diffuse, bilateral alveolar filling in chest HRCT especially in middle and lower zones. Anaemia with iron deficiency and hypoxic respiratory failure. Elevation of diffuse capacity (above 30% of predicted) is often recognized as a result of presence of blood in the alveoli. Broncho-alveolar lavage reveal haemosiderin laden macrophages. It may occurs most frequently as a secondary condition due to microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), Goodpasture syndrome. Among the many conditions it can accompany connective tissue disorders, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, some medicines or toxic exposures.
