 OBJECTIVE: To analyze the risk factors in the development of thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)  patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of thrombosis in 61 APS patients. Clinical and laboratory  parameters such as sex, age, thrombocytopenia, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and anti-phospholipid  antibodies were investigated to find out the risk factors of thrombosis. RESULTS: Thrombosis was found in 70.49% APS  patients, of whom, the prevalence of arterial and venous thrombosis were 36.67% and 39.34%, respectively. Deep vein thrombosis of  lower extremity (37.7%) and cerebral infarction (24.59%) were the most common thrombosis events, and then pulmonary embolism,  thrombotic microangiopathy and renal artery thrombosis were also common in APS patients. The positive anti-cardiolipin antibody  and hypertension were the independent risk factors for venous and arterial thrombosis, respectively. CONCLUSION: Anti-cardiolipin antibody is associated with a higher risk of venous thrombosis, and hypertension is associated with arterial thrombosis.
