BACKGROUND: Annexin A5 is thought to have a role in the pathophysiology of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)-a syndrome characterised by recurrent thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether anti-annexin A5 immunoglobulin (Ig)M or IgG antibodies, or the -1C-->T polymorphism of annexin A5, is a risk factor for thrombosis or miscarriage, and whether the -1C-->T polymorphism is correlated with APS. METHODS: A cohort study was carried out with a population of 198 patients with primary APS, systemic lupus erythematosus or lupus-like disease. For the detection of anti-annexin A5 antibodies and the measurement of annexin A5 plasma levels, ELISA-type methods were used. The annexin A5 -1C-->T mutation was detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: 71 patients were positive for annexin A5 IgM or IgG antibodies, of whom 53 patients were positive for anti-annexin A5 IgG antibodies and 27 of 198 patients were positive for anti-annexin A5 IgM antibodies. The prevalence of IgM or IgG anti-annexin A5 antibodies was not significantly associated with thrombosis or miscarriage on multivariate analysis. The prevalence of the -1C-->T mutation in the annexin A5 gene (46/198 patients) was significantly associated with miscarriage (odds ratio 2.7, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 6.7, independent risk factor). CONCLUSION: The detection of anti-annexin A5 antibodies does not seem relevant for estimating the risk for thrombosis or miscarriage in APS. The -1C-->T mutation was an independent risk factor for miscarriage, which is independent of APS.
