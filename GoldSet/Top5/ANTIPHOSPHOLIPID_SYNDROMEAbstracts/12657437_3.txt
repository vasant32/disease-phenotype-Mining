PURPOSE: Pregnancy complicated by the HELLP syndrome and antiphospholipid syndrome have rarely been reported. We report a study on anticardiolipin antibodies in HELLP syndrome. METHODS: Between March 1996 and September 1999, anticardiolipin antibodies were checked in all women with HELLP syndrome hospitalised in a maternity of the North of France. The women with positive anticardiolipin antibodies were seen month later in a internal medicine department. RESULTS: In the period 68 women with HELLP syndrome were checked for anticardiolipin antibodies. Apl were present in 9 patients (Incidence 42.8/1000 HELLP Year). They persisted after the accident only in 3 patients. Antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed in 2 patients, prevalence between the HELLP syndrome for the 42 month period was 0.03. CONCLUSIONS: HELLP syndrome may be a manifestation linked to the antiphospholipid syndrome and may revealed it.
