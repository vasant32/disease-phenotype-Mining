Corticosteroids have transformed the prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but no further advance has been achieved during the last few years. Treatment of SLE rests on the use, as rational as possible, of those therapeutic tools that are available. However, diagnosing SLE does not necessary, they must be given promptly in effective doses whilst preventing their side-effects, notably by the simultaneous management of atheroma factors. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and synthetic antimalarial drugs may be used to replace corticosteroids or reduce their dosage. Severe forms of SLE which are function- or life-threatening require immunosuppressants, the best one being cyclophosphamide administered monthly as intravenous bolus injections, as this drug has been shown to be effective and to have low morbidity. Plasmapheresis is exceptionally needed. The risk of thrombogenesis due to the frequently associated "antiphospholipid syndrome" can be avoided by anticoagulants or antiplatelets the respective indications of which have not yet been clearly determined. SLE being a chronic disease, patient's compliance with treatment is very important and justifies the efforts made to train and inform these young male or female patients.
