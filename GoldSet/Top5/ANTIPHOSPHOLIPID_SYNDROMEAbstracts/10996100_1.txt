Difficulties to establish general characteristics of patients with Raynaud's phenomenon, especially frequency, rates and predisposing factors of the evolution of primary to secondary cases probably originate from substantial variation of evaluated cohorts. We conducted a prospective study using standardised diagnostic procedures in order to look for the specificity of patients referred to the vascular centre; moreover, we assayed anticardiolipin antibodies in these patients using double ELISA and compared its frequency to sex and age matched a control group of 50 healthy individuals. 124 patients (20 men), mean age at onset 35.5 yr, range 9-69 yr, had confirmed diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon. Ninety nine patients were found to have secondary phenomenon, 72% of them had trophic changes of fingers and/or toes. Anticardiolipin antibodies assay was positive in seven patients and four healthy donors. Vascular diseases constituted about 20%, and connective tissue diseases 50% of secondary cases, but SLE (17 cases) not a scleroderma (11 cases) was the most frequent clinical entity in the latter group. There were only two patients with Buerger's disease and one with atherosclerosis as an underlying disease for vasospastic disorder. We concluded in the vascular medicine centre that there were a lot of patients with ischemic necrosis or other type of trophic changes, and very little primary, benign Raynaud's disease cases; surprisingly, peripheral arterial occlusive disease was very seldom responsible for vasospastic episodes. Primary or secondary antiphospholipid syndrome is not associated with Raynaud's phenomenon.
