During one year from July 1992 to July 1993, we performed usual hemostasis tests in a population or 3,700 patients. We found 12 patients with a lupus like anticoagulant (incidence: 1/1,000). Among these 12, four had unexplained polyneuropathy or my√©lopathy. Lupus like anticoagulant was either isolated (two cases), either associated with thrombosis (two cases). We report these four cases and we discuss the causal or uncasual nature of this association.
