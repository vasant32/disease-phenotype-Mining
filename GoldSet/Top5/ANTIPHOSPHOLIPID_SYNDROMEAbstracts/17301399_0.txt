We present the first reported case of antiphospholipid syndrome with stroke in an Iranian boy (7-month-old) who had two ischemic strokes within a period of 2 months. Serum anticardiolipid antibody was positive and the patient had low levels of protein S and C. This case emphasizes the importance of antiphospholipid antibody in children with unexplained ischemic stroke.
