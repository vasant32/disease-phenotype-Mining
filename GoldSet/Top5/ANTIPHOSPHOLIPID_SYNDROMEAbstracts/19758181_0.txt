Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a multisystem disorder characterized by arterial and venous thrombosis, pregnancy morbidity, and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Antiphospholipid IgG injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) cause behavioral hyperactivity in mice. In the present study we investigated the effects of APS whole-serum i.c.v. administration in female Balb/C mice. Control mice were injected with serum derived from healthy subjects or saline solution. Behavior was assessed by the staircase apparatus which combines locomotor (stair-climbing) exploratory activities and rearing as a measure of anxiety. Mice injected with serum from APS patients or serum from normal subjects showed a trend to an increase in the number of stairs climbed in the APS group. The results suggest a differential effect of specific IgG and other serum components in the CNS manifestations of APS.
