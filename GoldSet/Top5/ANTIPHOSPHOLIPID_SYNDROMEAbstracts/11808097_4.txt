A 48-year-old woman admitted with progressive dyspnea had previously been diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, and chronic renal failure, and had undergone mitral valve replacement with a Carpentier-Edwards pericardial bioprosthesis for mitral insufficiency 9 years before. She suffered a cerebral infarction 5 years earlier, despite appropriate anticoagulant therapy. On admission, echocardiography showed severe bioprosthetic stenosis. Repeat mitral valve replacement was conducted using a Mosaic bioprosthesis. On postoperative day 2, when heparinization was commenced, she suddenly had an epileptic fit. She also developed ischemic necrosis of the fingers and toes, considered secondary to microthrombosis. Aspirin was administered and heparin replaced by warfarin sodium. Necrosis gradually disappeared, and she was discharged 3 months after surgery. The original bioprosthesis showed degenerative changes with significant thrombus formation on cusps, thought to be mainly due to her hypercoagulable state. Considering the thrombophilic tendency in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, strict management of anticoagulant therapy is required.
