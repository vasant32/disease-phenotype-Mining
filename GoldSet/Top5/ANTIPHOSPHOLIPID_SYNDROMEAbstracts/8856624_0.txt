OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in children with acute cerebral infarction. METHODS: The study was carried out in 10 consecutive patients during the first days of neurological symptoms. aPL detected as lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and natural anticoagulant proteins C, S, and antithrombin III were determined in all patients. RESULTS: Seven patients had acute cerebral infarctions associated with aCL; 4 of these patients had high serum aCL concentrations in 2 different determinations (antiphospholipid syndrome). Two patients had temporary protein C deficiency. In one patient with negative aCL, protein C, S, and antithrombin III determinations were not carried out. No patient had evidence of connective tissue disease or family history of hypercoagulable state. After followup of 15.7 months, no patient had recurrent infarction while taking aspirin. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates high prevalence of aCL in children who suffer acute cerebral infarction and our results suggest aspirin may be effective therapy to prevent recurrences.
