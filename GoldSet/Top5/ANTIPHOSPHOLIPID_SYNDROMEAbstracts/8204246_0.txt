Primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAS) is characterized by the isolated presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the absence of other immunological changes. Its association with ischemic cerebrovascular disease is rarely reported. This study analyzes this association in 10 patients (8 women) first presenting with ischemic cerebrovascular accident (ICVA) that met the criteria for PAS. The average age of the patients was 50.4 years. Two patients had Sneddon's syndrome. Prolonged thromboplastin partial activation time was found in only three patients. Eight started aspirin therapy. The average time of follow-up was 17.2 months, during which there was one relapse. PAS should be included as a possible cause when examining individuals with ICVA, particularly when patients are young, when abortion has occurred or when no other cause is evident. Acetylsalicylic acid is effective for preventing relapse when other vascular risk factors are carefully controlled.
