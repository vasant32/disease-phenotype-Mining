We present a 12-year-old girl with systemic lupus erythematosus and associated antiphospholipid syndrome who developed an unusual manifestation of purpura fulminans in an accelerated fashion. The patient improved after prompt treatment with anticoagulants, aggressive immunosuppressive drugs and plasmapheresis. This is the first pediatric case of purpura fulminans due to secondary antiphospholipid syndrome of systemic lupus erythematosus. We suggest that SLE patients with lupus anticoagulant should be followed closely for similar complications.
