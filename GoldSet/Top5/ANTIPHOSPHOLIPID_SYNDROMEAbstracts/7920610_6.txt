Poly(ADP-ribose) metabolism is altered in patients with SLE. In order to localize the defect, the levels of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-specific mRNA were measured from dot blots of total RNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes. In this preliminary study, eleven patients with SLE and two with antiphospholipid syndrome were compared to three controls. It was found that the mean levels of specific mRNA were ten fold lower in the PBL from SLE patients compared to controls and no overlap of values was seen between the two groups. No such decrease was seen in the PBL from the patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. It is concluded that the defect in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase metabolism that is seen in SLE patients occurs at the level of transcription or mRNA turnover.
