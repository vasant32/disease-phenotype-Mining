The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship of ocular adnexal benign or reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, including orbital pseudotumor, with immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related diseases. Medical charts of 9 consecutive patients with ocular adnexal benign lymphoid lesions, seen in the Department of Ophthalmology, Okayama University Hospital, were reviewed, and pathological sections were restained immunohistochemically for IgG4-, IgG-, and CD138-positive plasma cells. The diagnosis of IgG4-positive lesions was based on 10 or more IgG4-positive plasma cells in a high-power field and greater than 40% ratios of IgG4-positive plasma cells/CD138-positive plasma cells and IgG4-positive plasma cells/IgG-positive plasma cells. IgG4-positive lesions were determined as absent in 5 patients (4 with bilateral lacrimal/orbital lesions and one with a unilateral conjunctival lesion), none of whom showed systemic manifestations. In contrast, IgG4-positive lesions were present in 4 patients (3 with bilateral lacrimal/orbital lesions and one with a unilateral lacrimal/orbital lesion), who showed systemic manifestations : one with Hashimoto thyroiditis, one with IgG4-positive bilateral interstitial lung disease and hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor, one with bilateral interstitial lung disease, and one with systemic lymphadenopathy and antiphospholipid syndrome. In conclusion, IgG4-positive ocular adnexal benign lymphoid lesions might be used as a benchmark for the probable presence of other systemic lymphoid lesions.
