We present the case of a 42-year-old female patient with the diagnoses of autoimmune hepatitis type I and autoimmune thyroiditis. Furthermore this patient had an unusual combination of coagulation disorders with homozygous Factor V Leiden mutation (APC resistance) and presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, leading to deep vein thromboses and miscarriages. Only few cases with the combination of autoimmune hepatitis and antiphospholipid antibodies have been described and almost all of them had become symptomatic with the antiphospholipid syndrome. As both autoimmune phenomenons furthermore share similar HLA-patterns, their coincidence is probably not as uncommon as the limited number of case reports suggests. Therefore attention in patients with autoimmune hepatitis should be focused on thrombophilia.
