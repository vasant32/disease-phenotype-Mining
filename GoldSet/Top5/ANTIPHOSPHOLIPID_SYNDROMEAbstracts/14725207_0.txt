Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome have a high frequency of mid-pregnancy intrauterine growth retardation or fetal death. The authors report the case of a 28 year old pregnant woman with antiphospholipid syndrome with severe obstetrical complications (spontaneous abortion, missed abortion) in the past history. By means of the administration of combined immunomudulant (intravenous immunoglobulin, steroid), anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy we could prevent a subsequent pregnancy loss of the patient. Apropos of this case the authors give an overview on the monitoring of the disease and the therapeutical recommendations of the literature.
