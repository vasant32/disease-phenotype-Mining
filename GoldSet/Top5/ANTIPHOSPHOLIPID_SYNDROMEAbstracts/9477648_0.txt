Antiphospholipid Antibodies has been associated with severe maternal and fetal sequels, like recurrent miscarriage, death, intrauterine growth retardation, pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease, thromboembolic phenomena and thrombocytopenia. Pathogenesis has been explained reporting that IgG from women with antiphospholipid antibodies increases placenta thromboxane production without affecting prostacyclin production, which conducts to thrombosis of placenta uterus junction. In 1982, it was suggested for the first time low doses of aspirin and prednisone for treatment of recurrent fetal death associated to this syndrome, heparin therapy was reported in 1984, recommended a doses of 15,000 U/day during first pregnancy trimester and 20,000 U/day posteriorly. The objective of this report, is the description a clinic case of a patient with recurrent fetal death and antiphospholipid antibodies syndrome, discussing a prenatal and obstetric treatment model, including diagnosis and final therapeutic, which includes the participation of some other specialists, the national experience in diagnosis and treatment is initial, and also because it has been reported a rate of fetal death in those patient with no treatment, almost of 90%. The importance of identify this syndrome is not based on its prevalence but on its maternal complications and that it is a cause of fetal death potentially treatable.
