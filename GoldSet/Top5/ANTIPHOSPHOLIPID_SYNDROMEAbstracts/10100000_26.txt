The present study was designed to investigate the effects of immunoglobulin G obtained from patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) on in-vitro models of trophoblast invasiveness and differentiation. We tested the binding of affinity-purified immunoglobulin G to human primary trophoblast cells. These antibodies affected the invasiveness and differentiation of cytotrophoblast cells after binding to the cell surface. In addition, we determined whether the drugs used to treat APS might be able to restore the trophoblast functions. Low-molecular weight heparin, in a dose-dependent manner, significantly reduced the immunoglobulin G binding to trophoblast cells and restored in-vitro placental invasiveness and differentiation. No effect was observed in the presence of acetylsalicylic acid. These observations may help in understanding the role of these treatments in women with APS.
