OBJECTIVE: In order to investigate the potential role of hyperhomocysteinemia as an additional risk factor for thrombotic events, we studied its prevalence in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and evaluated its association with different clinical features. METHODS: We enrolled 29 patients without any current evidence of underlying connective tissue disorder and fulfilling the Sapporo preliminary classification criteria for APS. RESULTS: Ten (34,4%) patients showed mild hyperhomocysteinemia (18,34 micromol/L +/- 2,04 DS). Nine had history of cerebrovascular disease, isolated (3 cases) or more often (6 cases) in association with other APS features. All patients, but one, showed multiple ischemic cerebral lesions. Seven of the 10 patients with hyperhomocysteinemia had multiple antiphospholipid antibody positivity and presented more frequently (6 cases) multi-site vascular involvement. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with primary APS is not negligible and appears to be associated with cerebral microangiopathic disease, multiple antiphospholipid antibody positivity and the simultaneous involvement of different vascular districts. For this reason and because hyperhomocysteinemia can be easily corrected with safe and relatively inexpensive therapeutic interventions, we advocate the measurement of homocysteinemia in every patient affected by APS and possibly in subjects with positive antiphospholipid antibody without a history of thrombosis.
