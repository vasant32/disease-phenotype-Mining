To explore the mechanisms of central nervous system involvement in children with Henoch-Schönlein purpura, levels of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2 glycoprotein I antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid were determined in 46 cases of Henoch-Schönlein purpura with central nervous system involvement. Results indicated that Henoch-Schönlein purpura with central nervous system involvement produced a higher total percentage of antiphospholipid antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, compared with viral encephalitis control subjects (76.1% vs 10.0% and 71.7% vs 0.0%, respectively; P < 0.05). Henoch-Schönlein purpura may be associated with antiphospholipid syndrome or antiphospholipid antibodies, which may account for the neurologic damage in Henoch-Schönlein purpura.
