 OBJECTIVE: To describe the pattern of pregnancy loss in women with a history of recurrent miscarriage (RM). DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study. SETTING: A tertiary referral center for RM. PATIENT(S): Five hundred thirty-eight subjects with RM. INTERVENTION(S): Women with antiphospholipid syndrome were treated with clexane and aspirin; some patients with uterine anomalies underwent corrective surgery, and some cases of retarded endometrium were treated with hMG. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Pregnancy outcome, including the stage of pregnancy at which pregnancy loss occurred. RESULT(S): In women with a prothrombotic state, the miscarriage rate before the detection of fetal heart activity (early loss) in the untreated group (50%) was significantly higher than in the treatment group (17.5%). In women with a uterine anomaly, the early loss rate and the later loss rate (after detection of fetal heart activity) were both increased. Women with retarded endometrium, women with >/=6 losses, and older women (>/=41 years) are more likely to have a further early loss but not a later loss. CONCLUSION(S): An understanding of the patterns of pregnancy loss provides further insight into the mechanism of the reproductive failure, which has implications for treatment.
