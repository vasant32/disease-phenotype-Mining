A 47-year-old man was diagnosed with primary antiphospholipid syndrome and Budd-Chiari syndrome (membranous complete obstruction of the intrahepatic inferior vena cava), with edema and ascites refractory to medical treatment. The inferior vena cava membrane was punctured with a Brockenbrough needle under multidirectional fluoroscopic guidance via a transfemoral approach. The occlusion was dilated with balloons of increasing size and was subsequently stented successfully. At 1-year follow-up venography showed patency of the stent, and the patient remains asymptomatic 2 years after the procedure.
