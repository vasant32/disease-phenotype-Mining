PURPOSE: Antiphospholipid syndrome is defined by the association of at least one clinical event (arterial and/or venous thrombosis, fetal loss) and antiphospholipid antibodies. It can be isolated or associated with systemic lupus disease. The purpose of this case report is to demonstrate that an ocular vascular event can reveal the disease and that its diagnosis is important because this disease generally affects young people and may endanger ocular and vital prognosis. OBSERVATION: We report the case of a 20-year-old female treated for systemic lupus erythematosus for 2 years, who stopped her medical treatment and presented a sudden bilateral loss of vision. Fundus examination and fluorescein angiography revealed severe bilateral retinal vascular occlusion. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome was confirmed with the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies. With medical treatment, there was initially a small functional improvement and then a general degradation in 3 months, followed by the death of the patient secondary to severe pulmonary emboli. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Central retinal artery or vein occlusion in a young patient must suggest the diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. The bilateralism of vascular occlusion is considered a severe factor because of its consequence on functional ocular and vital prognosis, where it can sound the alarm to the extension of thrombotic events to other vessels in the body. Antiphospholipid syndrome must be studied in cases of severe retinal vascular occlusion in young patients. Its diagnosis is important because the risk of recurrent thrombotic events may endanger functional and vital prognosis.
