Nephropathy of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (NAPS) is an increasingly well-recognized aspect of antiphospholipid syndrome. The most characteristic histopathology is that of thrombotic microangiopathy, and thrombosis occurring in the renal vasculature is thought to be the initiating event. Other less common pathologies have been reported, and the mechanisms of these are unclear. Therapy has been largely empiric. We report a case of NAPS in a patient with atypical pathology, who has declined therapy with immunosuppressive agents and anticoagulants and who has maintained normal renal function in 20 years of follow-up.
