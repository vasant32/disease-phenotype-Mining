We describe a young woman who displayed the "malignant" variant of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), also known as the "catastrophic APS." Renal insufficiency, retinopathy, cerebral infarcts, bone marrow necrosis, skin ulcers, and nasal septum perforation were the result of widespread thrombotic microangiopathy. She recovered during high intensity anticoagulation.
