 BACKGROUND: Infection-associated glomerulonephritis is rare in adults and its long-term prognosis is undefined. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical course of 50 adults (30 men, 20 women) with infection-associated glomerulonephritis diagnosed in our department from 1979 to 1999. The mean follow-up was 90+/-78 months. Patients were subdivided into two groups: group 1 included those without underlying disease and group 2 included those with severe underlying disease. RESULTS: At presentation, the median age was 54 years, and 33 patients were hypertensive, 31 had nephritic syndrome, eight had nephrotic syndrome and 11 had non-nephrotic proteinuria. Patients in group 2 were significantly older and had a significantly higher proteinuria than patients of group 1. Of the 21 patients in group 2, nine had liver cirrhosis, four cancer, five diabetes, three bronchiectasis, one thalassaemia intermedia, one polymyositis and one had anti-phospholipid antibodies syndrome. At the last follow-up, five patients had died, 21 patients were in complete remission, ten had partial remission, ten had renal insufficiency and three were on chronic dialysis. Multivariate analysis showed that an underlying disease (P=0.04) and interstitial infiltration at biopsy (P=0.036) were predictors of incomplete recovery. A correlation analysis between the year of diagnosis and the clinical/ histological characteristics at presentation showed that age (P=0.05), atypical infections (P=0.01), underlying disease (P=0.01) and interstitial infiltration at biopsy (P=0.02) increased over time, while the number of patients with complete remission significantly decreased (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Infection-associated glomerulonephritis may progress to chronic renal failure in a consistent number of adult hospitalized patients, particularly in those with an underlying disease and when associated with interstitial infiltration at biopsy.
