The treatment of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) was developed through a wide range of methods and technique. The excellent surgical treatment of CSDH is still controversial. The authors report a case of chronic subdural hematoma in a patient with antibodies antiphospholipidis syndrome (S. of Hughes). Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by arterial or venous thrombosis, and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (APL). APL are considered to be a cause of an acquired hypercoagulable state leading to stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA).
