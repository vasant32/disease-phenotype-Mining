 INTRODUCTION: Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease marked by neuromuscular transmission failure at the neuromuscular junction. Castleman disease is a rare lymphoproliferative disease characterized by non-cancerous angiofolicular hyperplasia of lymphatic tissue. METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe a young man with rapid, successive manifestations of myasthenia gravis, a solitary form of Castleman disease, pemphigus vulgaris, and anti-phospholipid syndrome, which resulted in 2 ischemic cerebrovascular events that caused a severe central neurological deficit. DISCUSSION: We were unable to find a similar case in the literature, but we hypothesize that the temporal concidence of these clinical entities may be related to a common immunological pathway, such as B-cell activation. Therefore, we treated the patient with an immunosuppressant and anticoagulant treatment, as well as rituximab, a monoclonal antibody therapy against CD20+.
