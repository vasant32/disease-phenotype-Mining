We encountered 16 cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in women during pregnancy and/or puerperium over the past 15 years at our perinatal center, representing 0.14% of all patients who delivered babies. The present study was undertaken to analyze the risk factors, clinical course and outcomes in these 16 cases. The ages of the patients varied from 29 to 39 years. Four women had pulmonary embolism (PE), 3 of which after caesarean section (C/S) at 35 to 40 weeks, and one case after ovarian cystectomy at 13 weeks of gestation. Twelve cases had deep venous thrombosis (DVT), 4 of which during pregnancy, and the remaining 8 cases after C/S. Four patients who had DVT during a normal course of pregnancy had severe thrombophilia: antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, a history of thrombosis and antithrombin (AT) deficiency. They were treated with heparin with or without AT and had healthy babies via successful vaginal deliveries. The common risk factors in 3 cases of PE with C/S was prolonged bed rest due to threatened premature delivery with total placenta previa, uterine myoma and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Other risk factors were massive bleeding, and positive lupus anticoagulant. However, the case of the ovarian cystectomy had only one risk factor, which was obesity. This patient died but the remaining patients recovered with treatment. Because of the low incidence of thrombosis in the Japanese population, prophylactic anticoagulant therapy has not routinely been given to patients undergoing obstetrical operations. However, proper management including prophylactic anticoagulant therapy might be considered for risk patients, depending on the risk factors.
