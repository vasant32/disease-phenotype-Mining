The relationship between arterial or venous thrombosis and the levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and/or existence of lupus anticoagulant (LA) was studied. The 141 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were divided into four groups: aCL single positive (25 cases), LA single positive (11 cases), aCL and LA double positive (25 cases), aCL and LA double negative (80 cases). The prevalence of thrombosis was higher in aCL and LA double positive patients (21/25 cases, 84.0%, P <0.01) than that in aCL single positive patients (4/25 cases, 16.0%), LA single positive patients (1/11 cases, 9.1%) and double negative patients (3/80 cases, 3.8%). Furthermore, in these double positive patients, all patients (10/10 cases) with a high positive level of aCL (> 10 units/ml) had arterial thrombosis, whereas only 2/15 patients (13.3%) with a low positive level of aCL (3-10 units/ml) were affected. Venous thrombosis was frequently found in the low positive group (9/15 cases, 60.0%). On the contrary, none of 105 LA negative patients had arterial thrombosis and only seven (6.7%) had venous thrombosis. These findings indicate that a high aCL activity combined with a LA positive result might be a risk factor for arterial thrombosis.
