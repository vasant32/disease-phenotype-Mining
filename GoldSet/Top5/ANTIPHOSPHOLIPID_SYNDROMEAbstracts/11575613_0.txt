Neurologic symptoms associated with antiphospholipid antibodies in children include thrombotic events, unilateral movement disorders, or migraine. We present a 7-year-old girl with bilateral optic neuropathy, cerebral white-matter lesions, and antiphospholipid IgM that responded to prednisone and tended to relapse when it was stopped. Remission was obtained under maintenance corticosteroid therapy, and the antiphospholipid antibodies disappeared. This case suggests a role for antiphospholipid antibodies in the pathogenesis of optic neuropathy in childhood.
