The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL) antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a relationship between these two autoantibody populations. To determine whether ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1 mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with nucleosomes. Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different lupus mouse strains. These results indicate that anti-CL mAb can have overlapping cross-reactivities with nucleosomes, thereby defining a new category of SLE-related autoantibodies characterized by their capacities to recognize distinct supramolecular complexes, formed by the association of an anionic structure and a protein, that exert a strong selective pressure on autoreactive B cell clones.
