We report the case o a 40-year-old male patient with "primary antiphospholipid syndrome" who developed ischemic cerebral infarctions and renal microangiopathy with infarction. A review of the literature on renal involvement in the primary antiphospholipid syndrome disclosed the differences from the antiphospholipid syndrome in the systemic lupus erythematosus. We describe the evolution of the patient at eight years, and we emphasize the importance of the treatment with warfarin. Also, we review the pathophysiology of severe secondary arterial hypertension.
