Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD), also known as sinus histocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, is a clinically benign, frequently chronic, painless lymphadenopathy. It can also involve extranodal sites. We describe a 37-year-old man with a recent diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome who had lacrimal gland and orbital involvement and nodal and extranodal sites with RDD.
