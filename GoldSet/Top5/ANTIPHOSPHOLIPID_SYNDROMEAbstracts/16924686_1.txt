Lupus anticoagulant hypoprothrombinemia syndrome (LAHPS) is a rare disorder characterized by a bleeding tendency due to factor II deficiency associated with the presence of lupus anticoagulant (LAC) autoantibodies. We describe a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and LAHPS in whom successful treatment of central nervous system bleeding due to severe factor II deficiency was followed by a major thromboembolic complication. Literature review revealed 2 other patients with LAHPS who developed thrombosis resulting from the treatment of factor II deficiency. We suggest that factor II deficiency counterbalances the prothrombotic effect of LAC in LAHPS, and correcting this deficiency may promote thromboembolism.
