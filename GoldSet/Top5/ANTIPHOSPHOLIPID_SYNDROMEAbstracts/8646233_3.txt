We describe a patient with Primary Antiphospholipid Syndrome (PAPS) and severe thrombocytopenia with bleeding, in whom treatment with high dose steroids failed to maintain a sustained level of platelets following an initial short lived response.  After several unsuccessful attempts with Danazol and aspirin combined with low dose steroids, the platelets count rose following the administration of chloroquine and low dose steroids and remained in the normal range even when steroids were tapered.
