 OBJECTIVE: To test the inflammation and oxidative stress hypothesis in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) patients and to identify possible associations with clinical and laboratory features of the disease. METHODS: Serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), 8-isoprostane and prostaglandin E2 (PGE) were assayed in the sera of 45 APS patients and then compared to control groups made up of 15 antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) negative patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 15 aPL negative subjects with pregnancy-related morbidity, 15 aPL negative patients with thrombosis, 15 subjects with persistently positive aPL with no signs or symptoms of APS, and 15 healthy volunteers from among the hospital staff. RESULTS: APS patients showed significantly higher CRP (p = 0.01), SAA (p < 0.01), 8-isoprostane (p = 0.05) and PGE2 (p = 0.001) plasma levels as compared to controls. Among APS subjects, significantly higher 8-isoprostane and PGE2 levels were observed in patients with triple positivity for aPL (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin and anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies) compared to APS patients with single or double aPL positivity. CONCLUSION: Both inflammation and oxidative stress, as measured by SAA, CRP, 8-isoprostane and PGE2, occur in APS and seem to be related to triple positivity for aPL.
