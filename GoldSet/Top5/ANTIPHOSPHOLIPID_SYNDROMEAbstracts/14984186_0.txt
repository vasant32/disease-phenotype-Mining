Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, hypercoagulability, and prolonged phospholipid-dependent coagulation indices such as activated clotting time (ACT). Perioperative thrombotic complications are frequent among patients with antiphospholipid syndrome submitted to cardiac surgery, therefore, in these patients, heparin-protamine titration for anticoagulation monitoring is particularly recommended. We demonstrate a case of 42-year-old hemodialyzed patient with antiphospholipid syndrome, submitted to the replacement of stenotic aortic valve. In our patient celite ACT and heparin concentration during cardiopulmonary bypass did not correspond to each other. Anticoagulation based on heparin concentration assessment resulted in safe perioperative hemostatic management.
