A 41-year-old woman with complete protein S (PS) deficiency who developed diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis is reported. She was referred to our hospital with nephrotic syndrome and thrombocytopenia. Her medical history included colorectostomy and amputation of the extremities because of repeated thrombotic episodes during her teens without any evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus. The diagnosis of PS deficiency was made from the patient's clinical course, undetectable serum PS in either the active or inactive form, normal protein C activity, and no evidence of the antiphospholipid syndrome. However, there was no definitive family history. A depressed level of complements and a positive antinuclear acid antibody suggested a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. The patient had a rapidly progressive course and died of disseminated intravascular coagulation. An autopsy showed generalized thrombotic lesions and diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis on both ordinal light and immunoperoxidase microscopy. Our observations suggest that PS-deficient patients may have a hyperinflammatory response.
