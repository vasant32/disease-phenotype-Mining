PURPOSE: To investigate a case of a young woman with both primary antiphospholipid syndrome and factor V Leiden mutation who developed multiple retinal arteriolar occlusions. METHOD: Case report of a 25-year-old woman with history and laboratory tests confirming the diagnosis of both primary antiphospholipid syndrome and factor V Leiden mutation who presented with blurred vision in both eyes. RESULTS: Multiple retinal arteriolar occlusions were observed in both of her eyes. The patient was treated first with heparin and then with warfarin. CONCLUSIONS: Primary antiphospholipid syndrome and factor V Leiden mutation, as well as other forms of thrombophilia, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained retinal vascular occlusions. The coexistence of several thrombophilic disorders may carry a particularly high risk for thrombotic manifestations.
