Comprehensive clinical laboratory studies were performed in 38 children with systemic lupus erythematosus. Screening tests (kaolin time, thromboplastin time with diluted thromboplastin, lebetox time) used which allowed secondary antiphospholipid syndrome to be diagnosed in 7 patients. IgG phosphatidylserine and cardiolipin antibodies were most frequently detected in the patients. Analysis of the findings has established the high sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic value of the lebetox-echitox index, which permits this method to be recommended for the diagnosis of secondary antiphospholipid syndrome in children.
