Primary Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (PAPS) and Autoimmune haemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a very rare combination. Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APS) with underlying SLE, however, has a well documented association with Coomb's positive Auoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia. We describe a young girl with PAPS presenting with deep venous thrombosis, livedo reticularis and features of AIHA. The patient was refractory to treatment for 5 years however, her condition improved dramatically with anticoagulants, corticosteroid therapy and the addition of hydroxychloroquine and azathioprin. We have also discussed hydroxychloroquine therapy in PAPS which is not yet fully established and the probability of this patient developing other autoimmune disorders in future.
