Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder, where the essence of the matter is the existence of antiphospholipid antibodies. The typical symptoms of APS are: venous thrombo-embolic disease and artery thrombosis in a brain. The authors present 5 patients (2 females and 3 males) at the age of 36-54 with ischemic stroke and one 26-year-old women with thrombosis of central retinal vein caused by APS. In 4 cases in secondary prevention anticoagulant (acenocumarol) was used and in 2--antiplatelet drug (aspirin). In 2 cases congenital disturbances of coagulation were also discovered. We suggest that in ischemic stroke and visual disturbances of not-well-known origin it is useful to make examinations concerning APS, as well as congenital thrombophilias.
