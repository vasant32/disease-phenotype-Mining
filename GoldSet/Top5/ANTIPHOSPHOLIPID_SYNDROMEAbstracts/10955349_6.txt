We describe a 60-year-old man with nephrotic syndrome due to a glomerular thrombotic microangiopathy caused by the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) associated with a lung adenocarcinoma. Although no significant aggravation of APS was noted following renal biopsy, catastrophic exacerbation of APS occurred 3 days after a lung adenocarcinoma biopsy while warfarin and prednisolone were being administered. The patient died of multiple organ failure 37 days after the lung adenocarcinoma biopsy. This case emphasizes the need for great caution for catastrophic exacerbation of malignancy associated APS following biopsy of the underlying malignancy.
