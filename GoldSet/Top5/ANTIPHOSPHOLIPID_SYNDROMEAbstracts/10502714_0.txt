Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APS) is defined by arterial and venous thrombosis, recurrent spontaneous abortions and thrombocytopenia associated with persistence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Thrombosis may involve virtually all arterial or venous sites, but deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs are the most common; however, unusual thrombi that involve the portal vein have been described. We report females with documented portal vein thrombosis and primary APS. The treatment of these patients is difficult because of the risk of bleeding and the recurrent thrombosis if they don't receive appropriate long-term anticoagulant therapy.
