OBJECTIVE: To study the outcome of pregnancies in women with primary and secondary recurrent pregnancy loss associated with antiphospholipid syndrome treated with the standard treatment regimes including intravenous immunoglobulin (IV Ig). METHODS: Forty three patients with recurrent pregnancy loss associated with antiphospholipid syndrome diagnosed before pregnancy and subdivided into primary (18) and secondary (25) subgroups were closely monitored all through pregnancy with serial blood tests and ultrasonography until the pregnancy ended in miscarriage or delivery. The patients were treated with low-dose aspirin and heparin and or steroids and IV Ig given to some selected patients. The maternal and fetal outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients in the primary subgroup (24.60 +/- 4.30) years was significantly lower than the mean age of the secondary recurrent pregnancy loss group (31.50 +/- 4.50) years, (p < 0.0001). 85.00% of all the previous miscarriages were in the first trimester. There was no significant difference in the incidence of live births in the primary (77.80%) and secondary (84.00%) groups, (p > 0.05); the babies were of normal birth weight. The incidence of caesarean section in the primary and secondary groups, 22.23% and 12.00% respectively, were not significantly different (p > 0.05). Intravenous immunoglobulin added to the standard therapy resulted in 100% live births. Maternal complications were negligible. CONCLUSIONS: The fetal and maternal outcome of pregnancies in patients with primary and secondary recurrent pregnancy loss associated with antiphospholipid syndrome were virtually identical and quite satisfactory. Intravenous immunoglobulin added to the standard therapy resulted in excellent fetal and maternal outcome, although its definitive role will have to wait for the outcome of randomised trials.
