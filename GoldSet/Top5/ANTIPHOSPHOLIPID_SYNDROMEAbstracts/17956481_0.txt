A 66-year-old woman presented with a reticulate pattern of purpuric, keloidal scarring affecting her lower legs and necrosis of her left thumb and little finger as sequelae of an episode of staphylococcal septicaemia. Her premorbid past history includes three miscarriages, three episodes of pulmonary embolism and an internal iliac vein thrombosis. Skin biopsy specimens showed keloidal scar tissue in the dermis but no evidence of thrombosis or vasculitis. Blood tests demonstrated moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia. Elevated levels of anticardiolipin antibodies were found on one occasion but this was not detected on initial or repeat testing.
