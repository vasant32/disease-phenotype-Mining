The aim of the study is to present our own perioperative bridging therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for surgical patients with thrombophilia on long-term acenokumarol therapy [oral anticoagulant (OAC)]. In some European countries, the drug used in secondary antithrombotic prophylaxis is acenokumarol. Forty-two patients with inherited thrombophilia and 21 with antiphospholipid syndrome underwent surgery. All patients were on long-term OAC. This OAC was interrupted 2 days before elective surgery and since that day half of the individual therapeutic dose of LMWH was administered. On day of surgery, the LMWH therapeutic dose was divided into two parts. Starting with day 2 after surgery, the patient was again given half of the individual dose of LMWH every 24 h. On day 4, OAC was additionally included. Both drugs were administered until stabilization of international normalized ratio (INR) values within the therapeutic target for 2 consecutive days. LMWH was then interrupted, whereas OAC continued. No symptoms or episodes of venous thromboembolism were observed. No intraoperative or postoperative hemorrhagic complications were reported. The results suggest that our perioperative bridging therapy is safe and effective for prevention of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications.
