Ischemic colitis results from insufficient blood supply to the large intestine and is often associated with hypercoagulable states. The condition comprises a wide range presenting with mild to fulminant forms. Diagnosis remains difficult because these patients may present with non-specific abdominal symptoms. We report a 51- year-old female patient with known Leiden factor V mutation as well as systemic lupus erythematous along with antiphospholipid syndrome suffering from recurrent ischemic colitis. At admission, the patient complained about abdominal pain, diarrhea and rectal bleeding lasting for 24 hours. Laboratory tests showed an increased C-reactive protein (29.5 mg/dl), while the performed abdominal CT-scan revealed only a dilatation of the descending colon along with a thickening of the bowel wall. Laparotomy was performed showing an ischemic colon and massive peritonitis. Histological examination proved the suspected ischemic colitis. Consecutively, an anti-coagulation therapy with coumarin and aspirin 100 was initiated. Up to the time point of a follow up examination no further ischemic events had occurred. This case illustrates well the non-specific clinical presentation of ischemic colitis. A high index of suspicion, recognition of risk factors and a history of non-specific abdominal symptoms should alert the clinicians to the possibility of ischemic disease. Early diagnosis and initiation of anticoagulation therapy or surgical intervention in case of peritonitis are the major goals of therapy.
