Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis at any level of the vascular tree and the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. The syndrome may be idiopathic or secondary to an underlying autoimmune disorder. The disease is uncommon in children, and manifestations are diverse and underreported. We report the case of a 10-year-old boy who presented with features of pulmonary thromboembolism in the emergency department. Subsequently, he proved to have systemic lupus erythematosus with circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. He had no signs of systemic lupus erythematosus at presentation. In conclusion, antiphospholipid syndrome should also be kept as a possibility in children presenting for the first time with pulmonary thromboembolism in the emergency department.
