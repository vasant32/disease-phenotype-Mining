AIM: To examine relationships between incidence rate of thromboses in antiphospholipid syndrome and exogenic risk factors (RF) of thrombosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial enrolled 131 patients (105 females and 26 males). They were divided into three groups: 23 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, group 1), 63 patients with SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS, group 2), 45 patients with primary APS (PAPS, group 3). Thrombosis RF questionnaire survey was made. Effects of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide on occurrence of thrombosis were assessed. RESULTS: Such exogenic RF as intake of coffee, fat food, alcohol were not related to thromboses. Hypodynamia was more typical for APS patients (21.3%) than for SLE patients free of APS (8.7%). Overweight for was characteristic for APS patients (49 and 34.7%, respectively). The proportion of smokers was higher in APS patients, though smoking did not provoke thrombotic complications. A direct correlation was found between occlusion and corticosteroids administration, while occlusion and cyclophosphamide treatment correlated inversely. CONCLUSION: Venous thrombosis RF in patients with APS and PAPS are obesity and treatment with glucocorticosteroids.
