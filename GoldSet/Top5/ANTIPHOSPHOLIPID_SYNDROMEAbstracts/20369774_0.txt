The presence of lupus anticoagulant and the related condition antiphospholipid syndrome present a challenge in cardiac surgery where measured anticoagulation may not reflect the in vivo patient status of hypercoagulation. We report the successful management of a patient with lupus anticoagulant presenting for aortic valve replacement and coronary revascularisation. We used heparin for anticoagulation, specialised additional tests of anticoagulation and a reduced protamine dose. We also used tranexamic acid. The clinical problems with anticoagulation in patients with lupus anticoagulant include anticoagulant choice, measurement of adequate anticoagulation, antifibrinolytic usage, protamine dosing and blood product transfusion.
