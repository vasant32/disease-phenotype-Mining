AIM: To examine the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) in the sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its clinical and pathogenic role. MATERIAL AND METHODS: TNFa was measured with ELISA (Immunogenetics N.V., Belgium) in the sera from 147 SLE patients (70 men and 77 women). The results were compared with those of 20 healthy subjects. RESULTS: TNFa elevated concentrations were found in 49% examinees with SLE. Concentration of TNFa, SLE activity and development of antiphospholipid syndrome correlated. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that TNFa is involved in pathogenesis of SLE. Quantitation of TNFa may serve a useful tool for monitoring SLE activity.
