Antiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder characterized by arterial and venous thromboses, thrombocytopaenia and stroke. Acute myocardial infarction is rarely associated with this syndrome. The treatment of these patients is a clinical challenge. This report is about a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome presenting with an acute myocardial infarction after an exercise test. The infarct-related coronary artery was successfully revascularized by primary angioplasty and stenting without any major bleeding complications. We think that the physical exertion could have favoured acute coronary thrombosis in this particular setting.
