The classical clinical picture of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by venous or arterial thromboses, fetal losses and thrombocytopenia, in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), namely lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies or antibodies directed to various proteins, mainly Î²2 glycoprotein I, or all three. Apart from being "primary" (without any discernable underlying systemic autoimmune disease), or associated to another disease (usually to systemic lupus erythematosus), it may also occur rapidly over days or weeks when it has been termed "catastrophic" APS. Therapy should not primarily be directed at effectively reducing the aPL levels and the use of immunotherapy (including high dose steroid administration, immunosuppression or plasma exchange) is generally not indicated, unless in the catastrophic APS. Treatment of APS patients should be based on the use of antiaggregant and anticoagulant therapy.
