Recurrent fetal loss is a frequent health problem. Data accumulated over the past few years have suggested a possible correlation between thrombophilia and fetal loss. Although a clear association has been established between fetal loss and certain thrombophilic states, such as antiphospholipid antibody syndromes, antithrombin deficiency, and combined defects, reports on the prevalence of inherited prothrombotic defects such as factor V Leiden mutation and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism in fetal loss are contradictory. The prevalence of these 2 mutations in Asian Indians with recurrent fetal loss has not yet been studied. In light of this, the present study looked at the prevalence of these mutations in 85 patients with spontaneous recurrent abortion and 31 controls. The authors did not find any significant role of these mutations in the development of recurrent abortion.
