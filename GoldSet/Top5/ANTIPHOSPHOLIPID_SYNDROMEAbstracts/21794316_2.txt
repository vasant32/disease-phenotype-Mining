 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Registrolesaf (Spanish Registry of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Primary Antiphospholipid Syndrome through Internet) enables little known aspects of systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome to be studied simply. The aim of this study was to analyze the features of patients included in Registrolesaf by rheumatologists and internists. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Among other data, Registrolesaf collects data on the specialty of physicians using the registry and patients' initials, date of birth, diagnosis, sex, vital status and, optionally, the ACR criteria on lupus and consensus statement criteria on antiphospholipid syndrome. RESULTS: From May 2003 to November 2004, 1421 patients were included in the registry (1269 with lupus and 152 with antiphospholipid syndrome). Rheumatologists included 462 (47.8%) lupus patients and 24 (16.7%) with antiphospholipid syndrome, while internists included 490 patients (50.7%) with lupus and 119 (82.6%) with antiphospholipid syndrome. Logistic regression analysis, controlled for age at diagnosis, disease duration and sex, showed that lupus patients included by internists had a higher frequency of malar rash (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.2), oral ulcers (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.4-2.7), neuro-psychiatric manifestations (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3- 3.8), kidney disease (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1-2) andantinuclear antibodies (OR 2.1; 95% CI 0.97-4.7), while the frequency of antiphospholipid antibodies (OR 0.6; 95% CI 0.4-0.9) and the number of lupus criteria (P=.002) were lower. CONCLUSIONS: Rheumatologists and internists have a similar approach to patients with lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome, although internists could include more seriously ill patients.
