Antiphospholipid antibodies (APAb) are often found in systemic lupus erythematosus (LE) (secondary antiphospholipid syndrome), leading to arterial or venous thrombosis. In primary antiphospholipid syndrome other LE-associated symptoms are not detectable. We present the clinical course and therapy of three patients with this rarely reported disease, discussing immunopathology and therapy. Three young patients (28, 29 and 31 years) were seen at the university eye clinic, presenting severe occlusive vasculitis with vitreal haemorrhages and/or thrombosis. The first patient did not respond to any therapy (various immunosuppressives, plasma-pheresis, laser coagulation) and ended up with defective light perception in both eyes. The second patient also had light perception as final outcome in spite of acetylsalicylic acid, steroids and immunosuppression. The third patient established complete reperfusion on an arteriovenous occlusion after haemodilution and acetylsalicylic acid. Antibodies directed against phospholipids interfere with the blood clotting system in many ways (activation and aggregation of thrombocytes, endothelial function, coagulation cascade). The optimal therapy of this severe disease is unclear, suggesting that acetylsalicylic acid seems to be important, while the effect of immunosuppression or steroids is uncertain.
