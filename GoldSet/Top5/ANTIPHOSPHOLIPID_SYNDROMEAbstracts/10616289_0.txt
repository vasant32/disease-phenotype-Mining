We described an 11 year-old boy with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and various coagulopathy. He had purpura on the legs, pancytopenia, positive anti-DNA antibodies and hypocomplementia. Hematological examination also showed that platelet counts were 80 x 10(3)/microliter, lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were positive. The aPTT was remarkably prolonged. Those laboratory findings fulfilled the criteria of antiphospholipid syndrome. Following treatment with predonisolone and heparin, thrombocytopenia improved. When heparin discontinued and renal biopsy was performed, severe thrombocytopenia recureded. FDP and FDP-DD became high, but the aPTT was not prolonged. Thrombocytopenia didn't improved by the therapy with heparin, high dose of methylpredonisolone, FOY and gamma-globulin. However by the therapy with both warfarin and cyclophosphamide, remarkable improvement of coagulopathy was absorbed. Probably anticardiolipin antibodies and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) participate in the various coagulopathy in this case.
