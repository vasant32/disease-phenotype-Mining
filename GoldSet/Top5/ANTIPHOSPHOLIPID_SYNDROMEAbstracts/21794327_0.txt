Antimalarials are long-standing drugs that have been used since the nineteenth century for the treatment of skin rashes and lesions in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. In recent decades, their use in these disorders has been consolidated, and new mechanisms of action have been incorporated, broadening the therapeutic perspectives of these drugs. Antimalarials are the treatment of choice in mild and moderate manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus and are established as part of combined therapy in rheumatoid arthritis. They have been shown to have beneficial effects on atherosclerosis, as well as a possible role in the early treatment of antiphospholipid syndrome. Lastly, they have been shown to have a potential use in other rheumatic diseases such as Sj√∂gren's Syndrome and palindromic rheumatism. This review aims to provide an update on the use of these drugs in rheumatology and to discuss their toxicity profile.
