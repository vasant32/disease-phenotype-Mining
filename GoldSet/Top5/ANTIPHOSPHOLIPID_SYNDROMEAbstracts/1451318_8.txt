Two patients who demonstrated skin lesions in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies are documented. The first had a long history of recurrent painful nodules. She had also suffered two deep vein thromboses. The second developed a rash on the lower limbs resembling vasculitis which did not respond to prednisolone, but to low dose salicylate therapy. Histology in both patients revealed microthrombosis of cutaneous vessels.
