This paper examines the methodology of anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I (beta(2)-GPI) epitope determination and provides further epitope studies using human sera containing anti-beta(2)-GPI autoantibodies. Studies in this field may be misleading as the antigen coating density using mutant forms of beta(2)-GPI may be below the threshold required for monogamous divalent binding by low affinity anti-beta(2)-GPI autoantibodies, while being easily detected by high affinity anti-beta(2)-GPI from immunized animals. The antigen density threshold effect is found in anti-beta(2)-GPI autoantibodies from humans and from monoclonal anti-beta(2)-GPI derived from mice with models of autoimmune disease. Anti-beta(2)-GPI from an autoimmune mouse and from 18/21 human sera did not bind above background levels to a domain-I-deleted mutant. In addition, single point mutations in domain I result in dramatic changes in the binding of many human sera containing anti-beta(2)-GPI. These findings support a conclusion that domain I of beta(2)-GPI contains significant epitopes for the anti-beta(2)-GPI antibodies found in the antiphospholipid syndrome.
