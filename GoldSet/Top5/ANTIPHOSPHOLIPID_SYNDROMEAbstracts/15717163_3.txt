Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease. Less than 1% of patients with APS present with life-threatening catastrophic APS (CAPS). We report here a case of CAPS in a young girl with cardiac, gastrointestinal and renal involvement. Although the management was complicated, the outcome was better than expected. We suggest that CAPS be included in the differential diagnosis of acute renal failure in children with multi-organ involvement and prolonged phospholipid-dependent coagulation time and promptly treated with immunomodulating agents and anticoagulants.
