beta 2 glycoprotein 1 (beta2GP1) is a phospholipid-binding protein implicated in the development of antiphospholipid antibodies, associated with thromboembolic complications and fetal morbidity and death, and is thought to corrrelate better than anticardiolipin (aCL) assays. We analysed the role of beta2GP1 in assessing 86 patients being investigated for antiphospholipid syndrome. Thirty-nine patients had 3 tests: [lupus anticoagulant (LA), aCL and beta2GP1], and a further 46 had aCL and beta2GP1. Sixty-one patients had completely negative tests. Five patients had beta2GP1 as the only positive result. 80% of this group had recurrent miscarriage suggesting that beta2GP1 may be an useful adjunct to aCL and LA testing in patients with a significant obstetric history.
