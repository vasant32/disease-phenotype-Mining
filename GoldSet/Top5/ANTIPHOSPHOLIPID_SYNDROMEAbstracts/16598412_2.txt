Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) has been recognized as the leading cause of vascular thrombosis in children. The syndrome may occur in isolation or in association with an underlying systemic disease, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus. Less than 1% of patients with APS present with a life-threatening condition resulting from thrombosis in multiple organs and subsequent multiorgan failure, which is defined as catastrophic APS. Early recognition of APS is essential because prompt and appropriate management can result in favorable outcome. We present the case of a 7-year-old girl with APS who presented with cerebral, femoral, and renal involvement in the second week of the disease progress. The patient presented with multiple thrombotic episodes and rapidly progressive renal failure. Renal cortical infarction was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging.
