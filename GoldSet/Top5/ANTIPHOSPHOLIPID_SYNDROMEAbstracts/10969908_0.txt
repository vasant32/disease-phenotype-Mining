A 30-year-old woman with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) presented with cerebral ischemia, thrombocytopenia, anemia and proteinuria. Administration of warfarin potassium, without concomitant corticosteroid administration, significantly improved all of these symptoms along with a decrease in the titers of antiCL-beta2-GP-I antibodies and a shortening of prolonged APTT. Therefore, the antiphospholipid antibodies in this patient could have been evoked by vitamin-K-dependent coagulation factors or plasma proteins which are assumed to undergo conformational changes exposing cryptic epitopes. This case report provides clues to the mechanisms underlying the production of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with PAPS.
