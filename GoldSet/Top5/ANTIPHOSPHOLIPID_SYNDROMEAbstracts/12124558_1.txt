The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) has been associated with multiple cardiac abnormalities. The present report describes a case of right ventricle thrombus in a 51-year-old woman with a history of autoimmune haemolytic anemia and antiphospholipid antibodies. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated the presence of a right ventricle mass, mimicking a myxoma. She underwent open heart removal of the mass and was started on indefinitely anticoagulant therapy. At 2 years follow-up she was free of symptoms.
