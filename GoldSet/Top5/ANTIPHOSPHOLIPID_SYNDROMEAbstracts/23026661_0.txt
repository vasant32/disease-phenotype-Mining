Over 30 thromboembolic events have been reported in factor VII (FVII) deficiency either associated with previously asymptomatic forms or bleeding diathesis. Whether this coexistence is fortuitous or not is still a mater of debate. Nevertheless, it is well admitted that (i) thrombotic events occurring in FVII-deficient patients with any apparent triggering factors are very rare, (ii) surgical procedures, replacement therapy (especially containing activated factors) but also the presence of an antiphospholipid syndrome are frequently associated with these particular thrombotic events, (iii) in the same way, R304Q and A294V FVII variants appear to be more prevalent than other FVII equally frequent mutations and finally (iv) low FVII coagulant activity levels do not protect against thrombosis. Therefore, peri-operative thrombotic prophylaxis should be relevant for these particular FVII-deficient patients. However, safety, treatment modalities and specific indications of such an antithrombotic prophylaxis remain to be established.
