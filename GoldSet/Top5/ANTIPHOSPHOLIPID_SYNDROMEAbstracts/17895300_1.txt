The aim of this study was to evaluate traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), homocysteine, anti-oxidized low-density lipoprotein (anti-oxLDL), anti-lipoprotein lipase (anti-LPL) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in patients with primary anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS), furthermore verify possible association among these variables and arterial thrombosis. Thirty-eight women with primary APS and 30 age-and-sex-matched controls were evaluated. Patients presented higher-LDL and triglycerides levels and lower-HDL levels than controls. Anti-LPL antibodies were not detected in both groups. The mean number of risk factors was higher in patients than in controls (P = 0.030). Anti-oxLDL antibodies, homocysteine and ET-1 mean levels were similar between groups, but abnormal homocysteine levels were found only among primary APS patients (P = 0.031). Hypertension and the presence of at least one risk factor for CAD were more prevalent in patients with arterial involvement than those without. Homocysteine levels and mean number of risk factors for CAD were significantly higher in patients with arterial thrombosis than controls. In a multivariate analysis hypertension was the only independently associated with arterial thrombosis (OR 14.8, 95% CI = 2.1-100.0, P = 0.006). This study showed that in primary APS patients other risk factors besides anti-phospholipid antibodies contribute for the occurrence of arterial events and the most important factor was hypertension.
