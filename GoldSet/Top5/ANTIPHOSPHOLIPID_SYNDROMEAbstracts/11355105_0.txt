The paper demonstrates anti-phospholipid antibodies to be a risk factor in ischaemic stroke in children. The function and importance of anticardiolipid antibodies and lupus anticoagulant are discussed. The author recall the definition of the anti-phospholipid syndrome and the resultant neurological disturbances, especially ischaemic stroke in children. In a series of 20 patients with cerebral ischaemic stroke aged 8 months to 16 years and hospitalized in the years 1990-98, anticardiolipid antibodies were determined. Of 20 patients, 12 children tested positive and preventive aspirin therapy was initiated. These preliminary results invite further investigations on the role of anticardiolipid antibodies in the pathogenesis of cerebral vascular diseases in children.
