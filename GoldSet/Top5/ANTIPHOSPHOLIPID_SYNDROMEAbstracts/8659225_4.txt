The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) consists clinically of both arterial and venous thrombosis, recurrent fetal loss and thrombocytopenia associated with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Most of these patients were initially found to suffer from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). There is an increasing group of patients who exhibit antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombotic complications without clinical features of SLE or related autoimmune disease termed primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS). The case of a 29-year-old woman with thrombosis of the terminal aorta and deep vein thrombosis, recurrent fetal loss, antiphospholipid antibodies and serological support for an underlying connective tissue disease, probably preclinical SLE is reported.
