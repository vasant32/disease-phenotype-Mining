OBJECTIVE: Despite multiple systemic manifestations, sudden sensorineural hearing loss in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome is rarely reported. PATIENT: A 46-year-old man with primary antiphospholipid syndrome had a sudden onset of hearing loss and tinnitus in the right ear in December 2005, because he discontinued use of warfarin and acetylsalicylic acid for a few days. RESULTS: Audiometry revealed saucer-type sensorineural hearing loss with a pure tone average of 73 dB in the right ear, and flat-type hearing loss with a pure tone average of 25 dB in the left ear. Electronystagmography displayed multiple central signs and bilateral canal paresis, while a vestibular evoked myogenic potential test revealed bilateral delayed responses. After admission, the patient was re-treated with warfarin and acetylsalicylic acid. Follow-up audiometry showed recovery of right-sided hearing, with a pure tone average of 12 dB, three days after presentation. CONCLUSION: Consensus exists on the effectiveness of anticoagulant agents in aiding a favourable outcome of sudden sensorineural hearing loss in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.
