Primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is a protean disease with many manifestations including venous and arterial thrombosis, recurrent foetal loss, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, cardiac valvular disease, glomerulonephritis, thrombocytopaenia and livedo reticularis. We report an interesting case of a 19-year-old woman where the diagnosis of primary APS was initially made in the peripartum period.
