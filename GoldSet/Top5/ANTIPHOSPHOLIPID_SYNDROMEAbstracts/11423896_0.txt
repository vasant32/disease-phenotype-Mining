The antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and the association of protean clinical manifestations as a result of both venous and arterial thrombosis. Because diffuse alveolar hemorrhage leading to acute respiratory failure is a rather unusual complication of antiphospholipid antibodies, this diagnosis may be overlooked or its manifestations are attributed to another disease. Presented here is a young Saudi female with primary antiphospholipid syndrome who recovered after a stormy clinical course of acute respiratory failure in the intensive care unit.
