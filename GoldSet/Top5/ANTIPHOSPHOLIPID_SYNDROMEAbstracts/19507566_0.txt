Hereditary or acquired thrombophilia may induce many complications in pregnant women, the relationship between thrombophilia and recurrent miscarriages as well as intrauterine death in the second half of the pregnancy being identified as a particularly frequent one. The introduction of detailed diagnostic methods in women with pregnancy loss in anamnesis allow for more frequent recognition of multifactorial thrombophilia. However, uniform recommendations connected with pregnancy course in these cases, application of anticoagulation prophylaxis and optimal dosage are lacking. In this manuscript we have described the course of a pregnancy, delivery and puerperium of a pregnant woman with recurrent miscarriages in anamnesis, antiphospholipid syndrome, being simultaneously a carrier of both--Leiden (1691G>A) and 20210G>A prothrombin mutations--(multifactorial thrombophilia), in which anticoagulant prophylaxis has been successfully applied.
