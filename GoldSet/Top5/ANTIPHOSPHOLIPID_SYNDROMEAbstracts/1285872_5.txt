The management of 56 pregnancies in 54 patients is presented, 52 with systemic lupus erythematosus and two patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome. All underwent serial Doppler blood flow studies of the umbilical and uterine arteries from 14 weeks of gestation. Drug therapy was directed at disease activity and the fetus and mother monitored intensively to identify optimum time for delivery. End diastolic blood flow (EDF) studies were compared with anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and the lupus anticoagulant (LAC) to predict outcome of pregnancy in terms of mortality, Caesarian delivery, hypertension, and gestation. The absence of end-diastolic blood flow predicted Caesarian delivery more accurately. The presence of EDF and the absence of aCL was consistent with a normotensive pregnancy. The presence of LAC was the best of the three in predicting fetal demise.
