Five cases of antiphospholipid syndrome with mild headache, but without any neurological deficits and abnormal findings by CT and MRI, were examined by cerebral blood perfusion SPECT using N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (IMP). Although three cases were performed quantification of cerebral blood flow with a microsphere method simultaneously, their values were within normal limits. Two of them showed focal low perfusion areas. One case had relatively low perfusion areas in the bilateral occipital lobes and the right temporal lobe, which improved after treatment. One of two had low perfusion in the bilateral occipital lobes. Other three cases only showed uniformity of radioisotope uptake on the cerebral blood perfusion SPECT. Low perfusion areas in antiphospholipid syndrome might be caused by microarterial thrombosis, microvenous thrombosis or spasms, although they could be reversible. As early detection of cerebral abnormality admit to protect irreversible progress of cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood flow SPECT should be performed in cases of antiphospholipid syndrome with neurological complaints.
