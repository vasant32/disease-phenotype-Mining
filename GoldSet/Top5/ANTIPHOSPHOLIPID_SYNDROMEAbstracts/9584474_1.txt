We report a 55-year-old female patient with antiphospholipid syndrome secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus. The patient had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting for myocardial infarction due to left main trunk stenosis at the age of 52. Subsequently, she developed aortic insufficiency and underwent aortic valve replacement without any hemodynamic or hemostatic problems. Both coronary and valve disease should be considered in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus.
