INTRODUCTION: Although multiple sclerosis (MS) and antiphospholipid syndrome (AS) are usually defined by specific criteria that make them distinguishable, in some cases, transition between the two diseases based on clinical and brain imaging findings is not clear. METHODS: Our study included 62 patients (sex ratio F/M = 1.48; mean age 43.4 +/- 23.6 years) with diagnosis of MS according to Poser criteria and 31 control subjects (sex ratio F/M = 9.3, mean age 37 +/- 17 years). We examined the level of antibodies against phospholipids (anticardiolipid, anti beta 2-glycoprotein 1 and antiphosphatidylethanolamine antibodies), antinuclear, anti native DNA, antiprothrombinase antibodies and rheumatoid factor. RESULTS: Antiphospholipid antibodies were found with a significant level (anticardiolipid > 30 UI, anti beta 2-glycoprotein 1 positive) in only five patients (8%) with MS; two others showed an increase in antinuclear antibodies (1/320 degrees and 1/1280 degrees). CONCLUSION: In contrast with data recently reported, this study failed to find a significant level of antiphospholipid antibodies in MS. This result argues for the existence of different pathogenic mechanisms in MS and AS.
