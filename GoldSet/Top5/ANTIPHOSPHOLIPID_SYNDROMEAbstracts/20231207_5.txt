 OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the cytokine profiles of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) in relation to underlying rheumatic diseases and prognosis. METHODS: The clinical features and laboratory data of 18 patients with MAS and rheumatic diseases were retrospectively analyzed. Serum levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), interleukin 18 (IL-18), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 6, interferon-gamma, ferritin, and beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) were measured. These data were compared between underlying diseases and between those who died and those who recovered. RESULTS: Of the 18 patients with MAS, 9 had underlying systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 7 had adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), 1 had rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 1 had antiphospholipid syndrome. Three patients with SLE and 1 patient with RA died. The serum M-CSF and IL-18 levels were substantially elevated in all the patients. In the patients with SLE, the M-CSF level was higher than the IL-18 level (median: 4879 vs 1341 pg/ml, p = 0.0054), and it was the reverse in the patients with AOSD (5883 vs 228,350 pg/ml, p = 0.0017). The serum M-CSF and beta2m levels were significantly higher in the patients who died than in those who recovered (M-CSF: 18,245 vs 3404 pg/ml, p = 0.019; beta2m: 18.8 vs 5.4 mg/dl, p = 0.0058). CONCLUSION: The cytokine profiles associated with MAS differed between patients with SLE and patients with AOSD. The patients with SLE showed a prominent increase in serum M-CSF levels, as did the patients with AOSD in serum IL-18 level. Patients who died had higher serum M-CSF and ss(2)m levels, and this suggests that aggressive treatment for patients with MAS and these profiles should be promptly started.
