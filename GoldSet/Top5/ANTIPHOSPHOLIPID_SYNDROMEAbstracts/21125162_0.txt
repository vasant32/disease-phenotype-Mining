 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of clinical and laboratory manifestations in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) with positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA Hep-2+) compared to those in whom this antibody is negative (ANA Hep-2-). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a transversal study with 58 patients (82.8% females) with PAPS. Demographic and clinical data, comorbidities, medications, and antiphospholipid antibodies were evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty (34.5%) out of 58 patients were positive for ANA Hep-2. Comparing the group of patients ANA Hep-2+ with those that were ANA Hep-2-, it was observed that both groups of patients with APS did not show statistically significant differences regarding demographic data, as well as the duration of the disease. As for clinical and laboratorial manifestations, the ANA Hep-2+ group showed higher frequency of deep venous thrombosis (85 versus 52.6%, P = 0.04), a statistically higher frequency of anticardiolipin IgG (85 versus 52.6%, P = 0.02), and a tendency for anticardiolipin IgM (80% versus 52.6%, P = 0.05), as well as greater medians of those antibodies [33 (0-128) versus 20 (0-120) GPL, P = 0.008] and [33 (0-120) versus 18,5 (0-120) MPL, P = 0.009]. Such difference was not observed regarding other manifestations of APS, presence of comorbidities, lifestyle, and medications used. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PAPS with ANA Hep-2+ have a higher frequency of deep venous thrombosis and anticardiolipin IgG and IgM.
