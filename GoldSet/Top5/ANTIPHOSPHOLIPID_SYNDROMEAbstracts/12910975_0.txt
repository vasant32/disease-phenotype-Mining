 BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has become a major health problem in Japan. METHODS: We examined, postoperative recurrence of VTE in patients with preoperative venous thromboembolic events and evaluated factors that are relevant to the occurrence of postoperative VTE. RESULTS: Forty-four cases out of 38500 had been diagnosed preoperatively as having VTE in the period of 1995-2001 at Kitasato University Hospital. Postoperative VTE was detected in four patients (9%) out of these 44 cases. Patients who had thrombophilia (antiphosholipid syndrome) or recent episode of VTE within 1 month were higher in the incidence of postoperative recurrence of VTE than the others. Temporary infra-vena cava filters were placed to prevent pulmonary thromboembolism in twelve patients. In 8 of the patients, thrombi were detected in or at the filter before explantation. Three patients (7%) had undergone thrombolysis therapy. Postoperative VTE was not found in patients who had already received anticoagulant therapy (warfarin) for 3 or more months. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that newly developed VTE occurred perioperatively in 9% of patients with preoperative VTE, and that thrombophilia and a recent episode of VTE were considered as risk factors of perioperative VTE. Temporary infra-vena cava filters are a valuable device for prevention of postoperative pulmonary thromboembolism.
