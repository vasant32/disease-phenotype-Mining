A 37-year-old woman on maintenance hemodialysis for 3 years had multiple vascular access failures due to antiphospholipid syndrome. She was dialyzed via a tunneled left subclavian catheter, but after 1 year developed chills and fever during each dialysis session. Blood cultures grew out Xanthomonas maltophilia sensitive to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin. Intravenous administration of both antibiotics failed to eradicate infection. We added 'locked-in' ceftazidime, instilling it daily into the catheter along with heparinized saline for 3 weeks. Within 24 h the patient was dialyzed uneventfully, and all subsequent blood cultures have been negative. This case shows the successful use of a 'locked-in' antibiotic to treat an unusual gram-negative catheter infection. Two prior series have reported similar good results in infections with more common organisms. Such treatment may permit continued use of tunneled hemodialysis catheters for longer periods.
