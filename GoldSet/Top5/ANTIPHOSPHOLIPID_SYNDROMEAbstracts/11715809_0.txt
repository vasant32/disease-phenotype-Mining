The authors describe a thrombophil condition manifested at an atypical site--partial thrombosis of the sup. mesenteric vein. The diagnosis was made during surgery followed by haemocoagulation examination which repeatedly revealed positive lupus anticoagulans (LA). Early diagnosis of the acute state with initiation of anticoagulant treatment and solution of the diagnostic conclusion--antiphospholipid syndrome--make an optimal therapeutic procedure possible.
