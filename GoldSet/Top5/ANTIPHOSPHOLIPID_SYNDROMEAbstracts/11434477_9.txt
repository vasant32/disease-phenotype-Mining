Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a rarely reported manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This condition has been most frequently seen in individuals with concomitant anticardiolipin antibody (ACL) syndrome, although a direct causal relationship remains unconfirmed. We report an unusual case of a young male with sudden unilateral hearing loss as the first manifestation of SLE. This individual was also found to be ACL positive and subsequently presented with other thrombotic manifestations compatible with this syndrome. The literature regarding this condition is reviewed and the significance of this case in fortifying the association of anticardiolipin antibodies and sensorineural hearing loss is discussed.
