We reported three cases of childhood-onset male systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), all of whom successfully treated with a combination of pulse methylprednisolone (mPSL) and pulse cyclophosphamide (IVCY). All of them had severe lupus nephritis and were complicated with other collagen diseases. Two cases were complicated with Sj√∂gren syndrome (SS) and the other was complicated with both SS and anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS). After a combination of pulse mPSL and IVCY for a year, followed by oral predonisolone (PSL) and azathioprine (AZA), following up renal biopsy were performed in all cases, which showed histological improvement in glomerulonephritis. One case had flares a year later, but no flares were observed either in clinical symptoms or in laboratory examinations in the others. Their autoantibodies except anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) were eliminated. We suggest a combination of pulse mPSL and IVCY is effective for the patients who are suffering with severe lupus nephritis complicated with the other collagen diseases.
