The registry is a prospective, European, multicentric, longitudinal study, which follows a cohort of children born to mothers with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). It was started in 2003. In this report, we update the results obtained from the study of 110 mothers and 112 children (two twin births). Eighty per cent of the mothers (n = 86) had primary APS. Purely obstetrical, thrombotic and mixed (obstetrical and thrombotic) APS represent 65.5 %, 21.8 % and 12.7 % of the whole cohort respectively. Isolated antiphospholipid antibodies and isolated anticardiolipin antibodies positivity were present in 50 of 109 (46%) and in 34 of 109 (31%) of the pregnant women, respectively. In the babies, in spite of a high rate of prematurity (14.3%) with four (3.6%) of the premature babies born before 33 weeks of gestation and an increased number of newborns small for gestational age (17%), the large majority of the neonates were healthy. Thirty-one infants are now older than 24 months. Among them, three displayed behavioural abnormalities before 3 years of age. After completing data, there will be the possibility to evaluate the newborn status in relation to the mothers' diseases, treatments and antibodies and to follow the neuropsychological development and immunological evolution of the babies during the next 5 years.
