Arterial thrombosis is one of the major symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). However, thrombosis in a primary branch of the aorta has rarely been reported in APS. We report here a case of APS complicated by thromboses in both the left subclavian artery and the left external iliac vein. A 32-year-old woman was admitted in May, 1990 complaining of no pulse in the left superficial arteries (e.g., left radial artery) for the past 5 years and acute swelling of the left lower extremity. A left ascending phlebography showed an occlusion of the external iliac vein and arteriography revealed obstruction in the left subclavian artery. Collateral circulations were developed at the site of each thrombus. Clotting and immunological studies revealed a prolonged APTT, a high titer of anticardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant positive. We ruled out various diseases and clinical risk factors predisposing to both arterial and venous thromboses. Accordingly, we concluded that both thromboses were based on APS. Following treatment with anticoagulants, aspirin and corticosteroid, the swelling of her left thigh was diminished and the antibody titer was decreased within 3 months.
