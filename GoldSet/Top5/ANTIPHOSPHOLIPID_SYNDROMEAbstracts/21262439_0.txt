Although the typical thrombotic manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome, and pregnancy complications, are well recognised, the literature is awash with reports of more obscure associations and apparent complications. Some occur sufficiently frequently to be regarded as occasional features of the syndrome, whereas in other instances there remains doubt about any pathogenic role for antiphospholipid antibodies. The distinction is important as wrong assumptions may lead to failure to seek alternative diagnoses and the implementation of inappropriate treatments.
