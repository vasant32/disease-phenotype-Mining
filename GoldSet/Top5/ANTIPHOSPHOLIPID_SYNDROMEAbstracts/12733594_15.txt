OBJECTIVE: To document the clinical association between the history of pregnancy loss in patients with the diagnosis of primary or secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and the presence of different antiprothrombin antibody subtypes [immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM and IgA] in a cohort of patients with APS. METHODS: Records of 170 female patients with primary APS, or APS secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or secondary to other autoimmune diseases were studied. RESULTS: In female APS patients with IgG antiprothrombin antibodies (n = 105) significant associations to pregnancy loss (p < 0.0001), early pregnancy loss (p < 0.0001) and a negative association to thrombocytopenia (p < 0.01) could be identified. In the group of patients with IgG antiprothrombin antibodies and at least one pregnancy (n = 84) a significant association with pregnancy loss (p < 0.005) and especially with early pregnancy loss (p < 0.0001) was demonstrated. No association with other immunoglobulin subtypes of antiprothrombin antibodies could be documented. In the subgroup of patients with primary APS and at least one pregnancy in the history, pregnancy loss (p < 0.005) and early pregnancy loss (p < 0.0001) were found to be highly associated with the presence of IgG antiprothrombin antibodies. IgG antiprothrombin antibodies represent the highest independent risk factor for pregnancy loss with an odds ratio of 4.5. There was no statistically significant association with venous or arterial thrombosis in all IgG antiprothrombin antibody positive patients. CONCLUSION: The results of this study document the association of IgG antiprothrombin antibodies with pregnancy loss and in particular early pregnancy loss in a large and well-characterized cohort of patients. We would recommend routine testing for antiprothrombin antibodies in young female patients with APS.
