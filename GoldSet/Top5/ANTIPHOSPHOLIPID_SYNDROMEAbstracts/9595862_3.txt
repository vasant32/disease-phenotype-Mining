A postmortem neuropathological investigations were carried out on 23 female rabbits divided into 3 groups; pregnant animals with experimental antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), nonpregnant rabbits with antiphospholipid syndrome and nonpregnant animals without antiphospholipid syndrome. The aim of study was to analyze the CNS changes related to experimental model of APS in rabbits and to answer, whether pregnancy influences the intensity of CNS changes related to APS. The findings suggest that the experimental model of APS used in our study appeared to be effective in the development of the CNS involvement in rabbits. The extent thickening of CNS vessel wall is the most common feature of vasculopathy related to APS. In rabbits, pregnancy seems to be a factor facilitating the CNS damage related to APS.
