One hundred and thirty-eight (138) pregnant women who had spontaneous abortions were screened for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to cardiolipin (aCL) by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). A total of 85 (61.6%) tested negative, while 53 (38.4%) had positive aCL test results. A review of the patients' hospital notes was conducted and comparisons were made between patients with moderate/high positive (21/138, 15.2%), those with low positive (32/138, 23.1%) and those with negative aCL results (85/138, 61.6%). The variables examined were a history of previous abortions, the number of previous fetal deaths and a past history of medical problems such as thrombosis or high blood pressure. No significant differences were found between the patients with moderate/high positive aCL; low positive aCL; and those with negative aCL test results for any of the clinical variables examined. In conclusion, the prevalence of positive IgG aCL tests was high in this cohort of patients with spontaneous abortion. However, intervention is not necessary in many of these patients who have only a positive aCL test, but none of the clinical conditions of the antiphospholipid syndrome.
