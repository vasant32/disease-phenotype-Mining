 OBJECTIVE: To perform a global gonadal and sexual functions assessment in primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 12 male PAPS patients and 20 healthy controls. They were assessed by demographic data, clinical features, systematic urological examination, sexual function, testicular ultrasound, seminal parameters according to the World Health Organization (WHO), seminal sperm antibodies, and hormone profile, including follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), morning total testosterone, and thyroid hormones. RESULTS: The median of current age and age of spermarche were similar in PAPS patients and controls (37.5 vs. 32.4 years, p = 0.270, and 13.1 vs. 12.85 years, p = 0.224, respectively), with a higher frequency of erectile dysfunction in the former group (25% vs. 0%, p = 0.044). Further analysis of PAPS patients with and without previous arterial thrombosis demonstrated that the median penis circumference was significantly lower in PAPS with arterial thrombosis than in PAPS without this complication (8.1 [6-10] vs. 10.2 [10-11] cm, p = 0.007). In addition, the median penis circumference was significantly lower in PAPS patients with erectile dysfunction than in patients without this complication (7.5 [6-9.5] vs. 9.5 [7.5-11] cm, p = 0.039). Regarding seminal analysis, the median sperm concentration, sperm motility, and normal sperm forms by WHO guidelines were comparable in PAPS patients and controls (141.5 [33-575] vs. 120.06 [34.5-329] Ã— 10(6)/ml, p = 0.65; 61.29 [25-80] vs. 65.42 [43-82]%, p = 0.4; 21.12 [10-42.5] vs. 23.95 [10-45]%, p = 0.45, respectively), and none of them had oligo/azoospermia. No differences were observed between PAPS patients and controls regarding the frequency of antisperm antibodies, testicular volume by ultrasound, or hormone profile (FSH, LH, morning total testosterone, and thyroid hormone) (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Normal testicular function has been identified in PAPS patients, in spite of morphofunctional penile abnormalities. Previous arterial thrombosis may underlie penile anthropometry alteration.
