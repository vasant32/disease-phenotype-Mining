It has been shown that stimulation of endothelial cells and monocytes by antiphospholipid antibodies leads to a prothrombotic state involving upregulation of tissue factor (TF). We examined the in vitro effects of IgG fractions from patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and of a beta-2-glycoprotein 1-independent human monoclonal antiphospholipid antibody (HL-5B) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in comparison to untreated cell controls and to exposure to monoclonal IgG control antibody. We also examined the effect of recombinant monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) on peripheral blood monocytes. Stimulation of endothelial cells with APS IgG fractions or HL-5B resulted in time-dependent upregulation of MCP-1 mRNA and protein expression. Stimulation with HL-5B also led to time-dependent upregulation of interleukin (IL)-8 and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mRNA and IL-8 protein expressions. Stimulation of monocytes with recombinant MCP-1 resulted in an upregulation of TF mRNA and TF protein. In conclusion these results might represent a mechanism for antiphospholipid antibody-mediated thrombosis in APS patients.
