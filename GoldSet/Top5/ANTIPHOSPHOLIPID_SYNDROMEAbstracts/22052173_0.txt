 INTRODUCTION: The primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAS) is an independent risk factor for cerebral infarction. AIM. To evaluate the risk of recurrence, to compare different treatments and determine the risk factors associated with recurrence and hemorrhagic complications in patients with cerebral infarction and PAS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospectively collected data from 92 patients under 45 years (71% female, mean age 33.8 Â± 8.9 years) with confirmed diagnoses of cerebral infarction and PAS, treated with anticoagulants (n = 54) or aspirin (n = 38) were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical follow-up was obtained by neurological examination every 6 to 12 months. Outcome measures were: recurrence of CI, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and minor bleeding. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 54 months (range: 12-240 months), there were 8 (9%) recurrent cerebral infarctions, with no difference between treatment with aspirin (n = 0) or anticoagulants (n = 8). The annual rate of recurrence was 0,014 person-years of follow-up. The history of previous thrombosis and spontaneous abortions were more frequent in patients with recurrence. Aspirin-treated patients more frequently came from rural areas. Four anticoagulated patients developed bleeding complications, two minor bleeding and two subdural hematomas. 76% of the cases evolved with good outcome (modified Rankin scale: 0-2). CONCLUSION: With the limitations of a nonrandomized study, our data suggest that the risk of recurrent arterial cerebral infarction in young patients with cerebral infarction secondary to PAS is low, probably non-uniform and independent of the type of antithrombotic.
