We report a case of Sj√∂gren's syndrome with pulmonary involvement diagnosed by open lung biopsy. The patient was a 62-year-old woman with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Her chest radiograph and CT scan showed multiple bullae diffusely scattered throughout the lung. The open lung biopsy specimens revealed marked inflammatory mononuclear cell infiltration and nodular amyloid deposits in the bronchiolar walls. The mechanism of bulla formation appeared to be the check valve mechanism caused by the narrowing of the airway by the bronchiolitis. The patient was treated with oral corticosteroids, and her symptoms and laboratory findings became stable.
