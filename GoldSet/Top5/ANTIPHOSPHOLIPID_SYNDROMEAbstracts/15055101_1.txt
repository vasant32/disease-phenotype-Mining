Morphology of gastric mucosa is characterized in the presence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) and Herpes viruses (HSV-1 and CMV). A total of 85 patients were examined (20 patients with primary APS and 65 with SLE). Chronic active gastritis was revealed in 85% patients with APS and 96% with SLE. 60% patients with APS and 45% with SLE had mucosal erosions. HP was detected in 70-87% of cases. Mixed infection of the gastric mucosa was observed in all the groups which was significantly associated with increased fibroblast and plasma cell number in the tunica propria. Tissue eosinophilia of the antral part of the stomach was observed in 39% of SLE patients. Glucocorticoid therapy was not associated with erosions and was combined with vascular thrombosis of gastric mucosa.
