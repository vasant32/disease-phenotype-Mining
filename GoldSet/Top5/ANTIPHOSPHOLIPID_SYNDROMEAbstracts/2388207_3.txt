We describe a 32-year-old woman with the primary antiphospholipid syndrome given anticoagulation therapy for a second pulmonary embolus. During this therapy, she developed bilateral adrenal hemorrhage and adrenal insufficiency. We discuss the potential association between adrenal failure and the primary antiphospholipid syndrome, and briefly review anticoagulant induced adrenal hemorrhage.
