Recurrent thromboses, cerebral disease, miscarriages, and antiphospholipid antibodies are characteristic of the antiphospholipid syndrome. A 31-year-old man presented with limb ischemic and isolated right ventricular failure. Antiphospholipid syndrome was suspected and limb salvage was accomplished by anticoagulation and tibial- to-plantar artery bypass surgery. However, recurrent ischemic episodes were successfully treated with thrombolytic therapy and anticoagulants. The surgeon should be aware that patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and lupus anticoagulant antibodies have a high propensity for recurrent arterial thromboses and should use multiple therapeutic approaches to effect successful long-term limb salvage.
