We are presenting a case of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome in an adult female manifesting with abdominal thrombosis, pancytopenia, and alveolar hemorrhage. Alveolar hemorrhage is infrequently reported as it is difficult to diagnose, but it is considered as a life-threatening condition. The diagnosis should be made promptly based on clinical symptoms coupled with radiological features. Once this diagnosis is suspected, treatment with corticosteroids and anticoagulation must be initiated as soon as possible in order to reduce severe morbidity and high mortality.
