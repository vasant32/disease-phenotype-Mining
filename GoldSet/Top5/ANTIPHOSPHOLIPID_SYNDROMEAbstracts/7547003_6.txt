A 41 year old woman with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome presented with a cerebral embolus. This was caused by a mobile left ventricular thrombus that later resolved. There was an additional old left ventricular thrombus. Left ventricular thrombi such as these have not been previously described in this syndrome, and may have been under diagnosed.
