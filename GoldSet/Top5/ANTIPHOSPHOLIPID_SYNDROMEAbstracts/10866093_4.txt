Many patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) develop cardiac manifestations during the course of their disease. Pericarditis is most commonly seen, with a reported prevalence of 60%. Myocardial involvement is present in only a minority of patients. In recent years, due to better noninvasive diagnostic techniques, valvular abnormalities can be demonstrated in an increasing number of patients. Depending on the technique used, valvulopathy can be demonstrated in up to 77% of SLE patients. Although most of the valvular lesions will be present without any symptoms, valve incompetence can result in congestive heart failure. Valvular lesions are associated with IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and disease duration. We present a patient with SLE and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) who developed acute congestive heart failure due to pancarditis. Endocarditis, together with left ventricular dysfunction and pericardial effusion, were present. The endocarditis caused hemodynamically significant mitral valve insufficiency due to thickening of the mitral cusps. Just two weeks prior to the occurrence of congestive heart failure echocardiography had been normal. Treatment with high dose corticosteroids resulted in a gradual, almost complete recovery. Literature concerning cardiac manifestations in lupus is reviewed.
