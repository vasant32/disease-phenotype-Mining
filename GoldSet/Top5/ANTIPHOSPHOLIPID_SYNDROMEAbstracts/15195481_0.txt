A woman of 75 years old was admitted at our hospital for evaluation of worsening and weakness in inferior limbs. Several vertebral fractures by crushing, one doubtful discitis, an infiltrate with cavitation in the right superior lobe and one infiltrate in the left superior lobe were detected. In the biopsy of the consolidation a filamentous fungus was watched and in the bronchial washing specimen culture grew Aspergillus terreus. The infiltrates disappeared with liposomal Amphotericin B remaining with oral Itraconazol during three months more. The clinical and analytical data demonstrate the existence of a Overlap syndrome associate to antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome. We comment the peculiarity of the infection by Aspergillus terreus in patients who have not been in critical care and the good response at treatment with liposomal Amphotericin B. It contrasts with the high mortality referred in a recent review. Other aspects to comment are the coexistence with a collagen vascular and an antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome with the higher titles of IgM ACA that we have found in literature.
