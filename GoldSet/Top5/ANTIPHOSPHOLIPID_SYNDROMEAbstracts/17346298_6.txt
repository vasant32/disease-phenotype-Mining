The angiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may have a role in the pathogenesis of collagen diseases. We aimed to assess its serum levels in children and adolescents with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to elucidate its correlation with clinical features, laboratory parameters, and the overall disease activity. This study comprised 25 children and adolescents with SLE and 30 healthy controls. Disease activity was evaluated by SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) score. Laboratory investigations included complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), urine analysis, 24-h total urinary protein, assay of serum creatinine, ANA, anti-DNA, complement component C3, lupus anticoagulant, and VEGF. Serum levels of VEGF were significantly increased in SLE patients (579.5 +/- 184.7 pg/ml) when compared with controls (113.2 +/- 30.8 pg/ml) (p < 0.0001). VEGF serum levels were significantly increased in patients having renal involvement and neurologic symptoms than those who did not have them (p < 0.0001, p < 0.005, respectively). Serum levels of VEGF were higher in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, vasculitis, and skin symptoms than those without, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Meanwhile, they were similar in patients with and without arthritis (p > 0.05). VEGF serum levels were not correlated to age; inversely correlated to platelet count, serum C3 level; and positively correlated to ESR. SLEDAI score was positively correlated to VEGF serum level (r = 0.86, p < 0.0001). VEGF may be relevant to SLE pathogenesis. Its concentration seems to be a marker of SLE activity, which could help in disease monitoring and planning of treatment.
