We report a patient with community acquired Legionella pneumonia, complicated with pulmonary embolism. The patient was cured by levofloxacin and anticoagulant therapy. We performed laboratorial control and we excluded the thrombophilia and antiphospholipid syndrome. Our case report draws attention to the possible association between Legionella infection and pulmonary embolism.
