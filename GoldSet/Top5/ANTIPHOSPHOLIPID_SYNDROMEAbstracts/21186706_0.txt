A 27-year-old Hispanic female was admitted to hospital with fever, a sudden marked decrease in vision, and multi-organ failure shortly after preterm delivery by cesarean section for eclampsia. Her past history was significant for a spontaneous first trimester abortion and one live birth complicated by intrauterine growth retardation. She was found to have several focal brain infarcts, exudative retinal detachment, bilateral adrenal hemorrhage, renal insufficiency, hypertension and subsequently hypotension. Positive anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and anti-B2 glycoprotein-I, as well as deranged coagulation profile and PTT mixing studies aided in the diagnosis of catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Anticoagulation and high-dose intravenous steroids led to significant improvement in the patient's condition, including her vision.
