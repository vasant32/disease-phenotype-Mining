Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is characterized by life-threatening diffuse thrombotic manifestations involving particularly small vessels of kidney, lungs, brain and skin. We report a 20-year-old female with systemic lupus erythematosus and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome who presented typical organ and histological involvement as seen in CAPS but with protracted course suggesting a “smoldering” form of the disease.
