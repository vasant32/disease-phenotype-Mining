Sneddon's syndrome, cerebrovascular thrombosis and livedo reticularis, is often a variant of the "primary" anti-phospholipid syndrome (PAPS). We report a woman with PAPS, presenting as Sneddon's syndrome, with renal impairment and glomerular thrombosis on renal biopsy. An IgG anti-cardiolipin antibody (aCL) was identified. The aCL was purified by affinity chromatography, gel filtration chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography, assayed in a modified ELISA and found to be of the type that requires the plasma protein beta 2-GPI to bind aCL. As beta 2-GPI has anticoagulant properties it is postulated that its interaction with aCL has a pathogenic role in the thrombotic lesions associated with aCL.
