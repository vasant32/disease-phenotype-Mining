INTRODUCTION: The antiphospholipid syndrome includes recurrent thrombotic manifestations related to antiphospholipid antibodies. Adrenal insufficiency is a rare complication of the antiphospholipid syndrome. EXEGESIS: We report a case of acute adrenal insufficiency secondary to bilateral adrenal hemorrhage in a 45-year-old man. The finding of antiphospholipid antibodies and 6 months later of a polymetastatic bronchopulmonary cancer led us to diagnose a paraneoplasic antiphospholipid syndrome. CONCLUSION: We discuss the role of coagulation disorders in the pathogenesis of tumor growth and rapid metastatic spread. Assessment of the high risk for thrombosis may be of prognostic and therapeutic value in patients with evolutive bronchopulmonary cancer. Early anticoagulation treatment in association with classical treatment of cancer may contribute to prevent malignant process from extending and avoid metastatic spread.
