The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome may be associated with connective tissue disorders. We describe a patient with catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus who presented with recurrent abdominal symptoms. Our patient died, and autopsy revealed hemorrhagic infarction of bowel with numerous mesenteric hemorrhages. The treatment for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome ranges from aspirin, warfarin, and plasmapheresis to prednisone and hydroxychloroquine.
