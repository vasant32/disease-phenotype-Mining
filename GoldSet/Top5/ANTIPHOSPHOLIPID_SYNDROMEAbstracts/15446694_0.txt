"Vasculitis mimicry" or "pseudovasculitis" are terms used for the description of a variety of disorders that simulate systemic vasculitis and often represent a challenge in daily rheumatological practice. These conditions may present with clinical, radiological, and laboratory features resembling those of systemic vasculitis. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis, therapeutic approach, and prognosis are different. The pseudovasculitides constitute an extremely heterogenous group of disorders with conditions caused by infections, malignancies, drugs and thromboembolism. A detailed history is mandatory and this should include dietary habits, concurrent medication, recent infections or invasive investigative procedures such as PTCA or conventional angiography. Incorrect diagnosis may lead to serious consequences due to delay of appropriate management and exposure of the patients to the risks of potentially toxic drugs. Thus, pseudovasculitis must be part of the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with manifestations of systemic vasculitis.
