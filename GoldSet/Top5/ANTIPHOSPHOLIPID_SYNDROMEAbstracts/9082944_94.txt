OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ability of human anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I (anti-beta 2 GPI) antibodies to recognize the cofactor adherent on endothelial cells (EC) and to modulate endothelial functions. METHODS: Six human affinity-purified polyclonal anti-beta 2 GPI IgG and 2 IgM monoclonal antibodies (MAb) were obtained from patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome. The antibodies were tested for their ability to 1) bind to endothelial monolayers through the adherent beta 2 GPI and 2) modulate endothelial adhesion molecule expression and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) secretion. RESULTS: The affinity-purified IgG and the MAb with anti-beta 2 GPI activity, but not the respective controls, displayed EC binding, which declined on cells incubated in serum-free medium and was restored in a dose-dependent manner by exogenous human beta 2 GPI. After EC binding, both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies up-regulated adhesion molecule expression. Anti-beta 2 GPI MAb also significantly increased IL-6 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha secretion. CONCLUSION: These findings support the hypothesis that anti-beta 2 GPI antibodies bind and activate EC through the adherent cofactor beta 2 GPI, likely leading to a procoagulant state.
