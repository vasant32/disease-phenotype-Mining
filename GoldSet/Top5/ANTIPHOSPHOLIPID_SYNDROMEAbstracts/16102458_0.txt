Autoantibodies to prothrombin, first described almost 50 years ago, are paradoxically associated with thrombosis. Described is an unusual case of fatal hypercoagulability in a patient with multiple arterial and venous thromboembolic complications despite intense anticoagulation while being bridged to transplantation with a left ventricular assist device. Serum analysis revealed the presence of prothrombin autoantibodies and high titers of anti-nuclear antibodies, and autopsy revealed pulmonary arteriolar vasculitis. These findings suggest an autoimmune basis for the presence of anti-prothrombin antibodies and the hypercoagulable state observed in the present case.
