Pregnancy has been widely recognized as a predisposing risk factor for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, it still remains unclear why pregnant women without a history of familial thrombophilia or antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) have a higher incidence of DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) during pregnancy and puerperium. We examined the activated protein C (APC) system in healthy pregnant women and in patients with the onset of DVT during puerperium. Sixty unselected Japanese pregnant women without a past or family history of thrombosis or APS and 3 Japanese women with DVT during puerperium were evaluated. Endogenous thrombin potential-ratio (ETP-r) was measured by determination of thrombin-alpha2-macroglobulin complexes in thromboplastin-activated patient plasma. APC sensitivity ratio (APC-sr) was calculated by the determination of ETP-r in patient plasma in the presence and absence of APC (final concentration [conc.] 5.9 nM) to evaluate the functional APC anticoagulant activity. Mean APC-sr was significantly increased at 30 weeks' gestation (2.35 +/- 0.72) and remained high during puerperium compared with the mean APC-sr in nonpregnant women (1.15 +/- 0.63). Mean APC-sr in patients with DVT at the onset was significantly higher (3.57 +/- 0.54) than mean APC-sr during puerperium was, indicating that the sensitivity to APC was reduced in the ETP-based assay. These data suggest a significant reduction in the functional sensitivity to APC associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis during pregnancy.
