Primary antiphospholipid syndrome is associated with an increased risk of vascular thrombosis. The authors describe a young patient without any risk factor for coronary artery disease who was admitted to the hospital because of a transient cerebral ischemic attack. Standard EKG showed signs of a previous silent inferior wall myocardial infarction, confirmed by echocardiography, technetium-99 scintigraphy, and left ventricular angiography. Coronary arteries appeared normal at angiography. Blood tests showed the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and lupus anticoagulant. Since there is evidence that these antibodies are associated with an increased risk of microvascular thrombosis, the authors conclude that this silent myocardial infarction could be caused by a cardiac microvascular disease accompanying the antiphospholipid syndrome.
