A case of primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) with renal involvement in a 10-year-old child is reported. The peculiarity of the case resided not only in the apparent "primary" occurrence of APS in the pediatric age, but also in the involvement of the kidney. The renal picture in the case described consisted of a focal proliferative glomerulonephritis, without any sign of glomerular thrombosis. We conclude that this should lead to a consideration of primary APS in the differential diagnosis of nephropathies, also in childhood.
