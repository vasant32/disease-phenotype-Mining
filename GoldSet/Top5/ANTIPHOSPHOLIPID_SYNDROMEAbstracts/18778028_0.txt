We describe the case a 63-year-old man with overlap of primary Sj√∂gren syndrome (pSS) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). According to literature the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies is observed in about 20% of patients with pSS. The coexistence of pSS and APS should be considered as an infrequent, but not exceptional, event.
