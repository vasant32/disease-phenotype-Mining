Antiphospholipid antibodies are acquired circulating immunoglobulins that interact with phospholipids. These factors may manifest anticoagulant properties in vitro, interfering with phospholipid-dependent coagulation tests. They are not, however, associated with a hemorrhagic diathesis. Indeed, far from exerting the anticoagulant properties they possess in vitro, they are associated with episodes of thromboembolism, systemic and cerebral. We report the clinical and instrumental findings in 7 patients with ischemic stroke and circulating antiphospholipid antibodies classifiable as antiphospholipid antibodies syndrome.
