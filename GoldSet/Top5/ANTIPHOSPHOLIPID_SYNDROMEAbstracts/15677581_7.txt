 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although thromboembolic events are the major complication of primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS), cardiac involvement is commonly present. Left atrial appendage (LAA) is recognized as an important source for thrombus formation and thromboembolism. The purpose of the study was to assess the structure and function of LAA with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in PAPS patients. METHODS: Thirty-one PAPS patients (22 women, mean age 36+/-9 years) in sinus rhythm and 31 (17 women, mean age 37+/-7 years) controls with normal TEE examination were investigated. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent of the PAPS patients had functional and structural valvular defect predominantly in the mitral valve. Valvular lesions were especially frequent in PAPS patients with a history of cerebrovascular events, patients with history of arterial thrombosis (91.6%), and patients with high titers of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (100%). Intracardiac thrombus was present in 5 patients and in 1 of them it was located in LAA. The structure of LAA was similar between groups. Left atrial appendix ejection fraction (51.8+/-4 versus 48.6+/-5.5%; P<0.05) and LAA peak outflow velocity (87+/-10.9 versus 80.6+/-10.3 cm/s; P=0.02) was significantly higher in PAPS group compared with controls. In PAPS patients with mitral regurgitation (MR), LAA outflow peak velocity (84.3+/-10 versus 98.6+/-6.5 cm/s; P=0.002) and LAA inflow peak velocity (67.8+/-10.5 versus 80.8+/-8.6 cm/s; P=0.009) were significantly lower compared with PAPS patients without MR. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that disease process in PAPS frequently involved cardiac valves especially mitral valve but spared LAA function. LAA function was normal, but intracardiac thrombus was present in 5 patients and 1 of them was located in LAA. MR in PAPS patients seems to impair LAA function.
