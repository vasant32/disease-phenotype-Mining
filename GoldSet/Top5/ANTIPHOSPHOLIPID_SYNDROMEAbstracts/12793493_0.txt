A case is described of a 20-year-old college student in whom open reduction and internal fixation of a Weber B fibula fracture was complicated by arterial thrombosis and gangrene of the foot. The patient subsequently required a below-knee amputation. A hypercoagulability workup revealed the presence of an anticardiolipin antibody. Although this is an extremely unusual complication, young female patients with a positive personal or family history of early thrombotic events, such as DVT, multiple pregnancy loss, or early myocardial infarction, should be viewed as being at increased risk. Additional risk factors such as oral contraceptive use, should be sought during the initial history.
