The antiphospholipid syndrome is a rare disease causing recurring arterial and/or venous thromboses at various sites with the first manifestations at a young age. A case report of a 46-year old man with the first venous system manifestations at the age of 19 before description of the syndrome in literature, is presented. The diagnosis was made when he was 44 years old. Bilateral stenoses in the carotid region and a rare manifestation of renal arteries involvement with renovascular hypertension developed. Critical stenosis of the left renal artery resulted in an afunctional left kidney, significant stenosis of the right renal artery was treated by angioplasty and stent implantation. The patient status stabilized only after intensive anticoagulant treatment with warfarin.
