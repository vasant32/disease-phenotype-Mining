An aortic valve replacement and an aorto-coronary bypass were done in a woman of 57 years old after an orthotopic liver transplantation. The surgical risk was increased by the antecedent liver transplantation, the immunosuppression, chronic renal insufficiency and antiphospholipid syndrome. Surgery and the post-operative period were not complicated. Cardiac surgery is not a contraindication for patients with a prior organ transplant. These individuals have a higher cardiovascular risk and require a cardiovascular follow-up the modalities of which are yet to be defined.
