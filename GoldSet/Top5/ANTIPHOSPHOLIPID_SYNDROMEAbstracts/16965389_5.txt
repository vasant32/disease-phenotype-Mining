Prothrombin is now accepted as one of the target antigens recognised by antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies. However, it is not clear whether anti-prothrombin antibodies are pathogenic in vivo and if so, the possible mechanism(s) involved. Here, we examined the pathogenic effects of the IS6 monoclonal anti-prothrombin antibody isolated from a patient with Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS). IS6 antibody was purified from hybridoma supernatant. Its pathogenic potentials were studied in an in vivo model of induced thrombosis. The expression of tissue factor (TF) and E-selectin on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was determined by cyto-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Transcription of TF mRNA was determined by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In vivo, the thrombus size increased significantly when treated with IS6 compared with control-treated mice (5388 +/- 1035 microm2 vs. 2845 +/- 1711 microm2). In vitro, IS6 induced significant expression of TF and E-selectin on HUVEC, when compared with control preparation (3.1- and 5.1-fold increase compared with the control-treated cells). RT-PCR analysis of TF mRNA transcription showed a 2.5-fold increase of IS6-treated cells over the value obtained with control-treated cells. Taken together, these data show that IS6 monoclonal anti-prothrombin antibody promotes thrombosis and this is associated with TF and E-selectin expression.
