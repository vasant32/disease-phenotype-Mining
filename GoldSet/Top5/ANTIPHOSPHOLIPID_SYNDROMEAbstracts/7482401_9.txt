Several clotting abnormalities have been put forth to explain the thrombotic tendency of the antiphospholipid syndrome, but a possible role for fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor has been poorly investigated. The present cross-sectional retrospective study evaluated the relationship of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulants, fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor with the occurrence of arterial and venous thromboses in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies. Among the clotting assays for the detection of lupus anticoagulant, dilute Russell's viper venom time correlated with a history of venous thrombosis more strongly than activated partial thromboplastin time (p < 0.0002 vs p < 0.009) and was the only test which correlated with a history of arterial thrombosis (p < 0.01), also at low levels of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (p = 0.003). By regression analysis, and after correction for confounders, serum levels of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies were found to be positively associated with the number of venous events (p < 0.001). Plasma levels of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor were associated with each other (p < 0.0001; r: 0.48) and with the occurrence of arterial and venous thromboses (p < 0.001). Moreover, plasma levels of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor in thrombotic patients with antiphospholipid antibodies were significantly higher than those of a control group of thrombotic patients who suffered thrombosis for other reasons (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0008 respectively). Titres of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies correlated with plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (p < 0.0001; r: 0.42).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
