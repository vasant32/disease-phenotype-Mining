INTRODUCTION: We report an unusual case of a patient with clinical and histological features of cutaneous vasculitis. CASE PICTURE: A middle-aged Chinese male presented with livedo reticularis and digital gangrene without visceral involvement. Skin biopsy showed features suggestive of cutaneous vasculitis. Repeated testing for anticardiolipin antibody was negative. TREATMENT: He was treated with two courses of intravenous prostacyclin and pulsed with one course of intravenous methylprednisolone. He was also put on oral prednisolone, pentoxifylline, aspirin, nifedipine and colchicine in addition to symptomatic therapy. OUTCOME: There was gradual improvement of his toe discolouration and relief of pain. CONCLUSIONS: This is an interesting case of cutaneous vasculitis, which has features of polyarteritis nodosa and the antiphospholipid syndrome, who responded well to intravenous prostacyclin, steroids, pentoxifylline, aspirin, nifedipine and colchicine.
