We describe the clinical features, therapies, and clinical course of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in a group of Filipinos with connective tissue diseases (CTDs). We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients diagnosed with PAH by a two-dimensional echocardiogram as a tricuspid regurgitant jet of more than 25 mmHg. All patients had underlying CTDs, defined by the American College of Rheumatology criteria, and were seen at the rheumatology clinics of the University of Santo Tomas Hospital and the St. Luke's Medical Center, Philippines. Of the 33 patients (32 women) included in the analysis, there were 14 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 12 with scleroderma, 5 with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), 1 with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and 1 with dermatomyositis. The average age at PAH diagnosis was 38 +/- 14 years (mean +/- SD), and the mean duration of illness from CTD to PAH diagnosis was 53 +/- 52 months. Twelve patients had died at the time of this report, with a median duration of 15 months (range 1-57 months) from PAH diagnosis to mortality: six of these had scleroderma, five with SLE, and one with APS. The following therapies were used in this group of patients: low molecular weight heparin, warfarin, calcium-channel blockers, aspirin, cyclophosphamide, bosentan, iloprost, and sildenafil. We have described the clinical profile of PAH in a group of Filipino patients with CTDs, most commonly SLE. Various forms of pharmacologic therapies were used among these patients. Mortality remains high, particularly among those with underlying scleroderma. Early recognition and treatment are crucial in order to provide a better outcome for these patients.
