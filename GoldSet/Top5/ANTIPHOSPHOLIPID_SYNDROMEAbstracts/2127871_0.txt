The description of a phospholipid syndrome in patients with systemic lupus erythematodes (SLE) filled up a gap in defining an "atypical" subgroup--quite often negative to DNA antibodies but suffering from arterial thromboses, thrombophlebitis, aseptic bone necroses, and pulmonary hypertension. 54 patients with SLE and 32 of their closet blood relatives were examined for lupus anticoagulation factor, anticardiolipin antibodies and Wassermann test. The results were interpreted in relation to the forms of the disease and its clinical manifestations. Clinically healthy relatives positive for circulating lupus anticoagulation factor or antiphospholipid antibodies are under close control.
