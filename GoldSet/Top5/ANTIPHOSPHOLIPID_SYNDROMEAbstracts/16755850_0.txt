The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of various clinical and subclinical manifestations of atherosclerosis (AS) in men with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS), as well as to evaluate correlations between vascular atherosclerotic lesions, risk factors, and the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and cardiolipin antibodies (CLA). The subjects of the study were 62 patients (mean age 35.7 +/- 11.6 years, disease duration 129 +/- 102 months). Conventional and disease-related risk factors were analyzed. Carotic ultrasonography (CU) was performed in order to reveal vascular atherosclerotic lesions. Serum CRP levels were measured by the high-sensitive immunonephelometric technique. IgG and IgM CLA were studied by solid-phase immunoenzyme assay. CU found carotic arterial involvement in 58% of the patients; clinical manifestations of AS were revealed in 42% of the patients. The patients were divided into two groups: group I included 19 patients with APLS signs, group II consisted of 43 patients without APLS symptoms. The disease duration and lesion index were higher in group I. The study revealed a significant correlation between CRP level and intima-media complex (IMC) thickness in patients suffering from SLE with or without APLS (p < 0.05). Patients with AS displayed higher levels of IgG CLA, although the difference was insignificant. The study demonstrates that men suffering from SLE with or without APLS have a high risk of AS. An increase in CRP level is associated with an increase in IMC thickness.
