Technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime ((99m)Tc HMPAO) brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was used to evaluate the effects of anticoagulant therapy (ACT) on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (PAPS). Sixteen female PAPS patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations and hypoperfusion lesions demonstrated on initial (99m)Tc HMPAO brain SPECT images were enrolled in this study. Follow-up (99m)Tc HMPAO brain SPECT images were performed 1 month after ACT. Meanwhile, serum anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) were measured before and after ACT. Before ACT, 14 (87.5%) patients had positive ACA. After ACT, all 16 PAPS patients showed decreased serologic findings, and their neuropsychiatric manifestations subsided. After ACT, 11 (68.8%) patients showed complete recovery of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and five (31.2%) patients showed partial recovery in the follow-up (99m)Tc HMPAO brain SPECT images. This type of imaging is a logical and objective tool for measuring the effects of ACT in PAPS patients with brain involvement by determining changes in rCBF.
