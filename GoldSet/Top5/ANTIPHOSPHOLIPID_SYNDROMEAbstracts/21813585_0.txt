Fibromyalgia (FM) is a syndrome that can be associated with several rheumatic diseases. However, no study has evaluated its frequency in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS). The objective of this study was to analyze the frequency of FM in PAPS patients compared with healthy controls, to determine the possible associations between FM and PAPS features, and also to evaluate quality of life and depression in these patients. This case-control study included 30 PAPS patients (by the Sapporo criteria) and 40 healthy subjects. Demographic and clinical data, drug use, and antiphospholipid antibodies were analyzed. FM was diagnosed based on international criteria (ACR). Questionnaires on quality of life, including the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS), were also applied. PAPS patients and controls were similar in mean age as well as in distributions of gender and Caucasian race. Mean disease duration was 5.4 ± 4.2 years. A diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made in five (16.7%) PAPS patients and no controls (p = 0.012). PAPS patients had more diffuse pain (53% vs. 0%, respectively, p < 0.0001), ≥11 tender points (23% vs. 5%, respectively, p = 0.032), and a greater total number (175 vs. 57, respectively, p < 0.0001) as well as median number of tender points per patient than controls (5 [0-18] vs. 0 [0-11], respectively, p < 0.0001). PAPS patients had lower values in all dimensions of the SF-36, as well as higher FIQ scores, higher BDI scores, more depression diagnoses according to BDI results, and increased VAS in comparison with controls. Analysis of PAPS patients with FM compared with those subjects without FM revealed no significant differences regarding demographic features or thrombotic or clinical events; however, PAPS patients who also had FM had lower values in SF-36 dimensions as well as higher FIQ (82.6 ± 9.6 vs. 33.6 ± 29.8, respectively, p < 0.0001) and VAS scores (6.6 ± 2.97 vs. 3.25 ± 3.11, respectively, p = 0.03). BDI scores, in contrast, were similar in both groups. In conclusion, one-fifth of PAPS patients had fibromyalgia and a low quality of life when compared with healthy subjects.
