We report antiphospholipid antibody positivity in three of a consecutive series of 23 children presenting partial epileptic seizures. There was no clinical or serological evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus or other connective-tissue disease. Neither computed tomography nor magnetic resonance imaging revealed ischemic alteration. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in 3/23 children may indicate that immune-mediated neuronal damage could be a pathogenetic mechanism for partial epilepsy.
