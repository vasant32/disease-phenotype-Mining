 OBJECTIVE: Based on 2006 revised classification criteria of definite antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and definition of new APS subsets, we investigated clinical features of APS patients, correlation between thrombotic events and related antibodies was assessed as well. METHODS: 165 patients with APS were enrolled and analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: 124 female and 41 male patients were included. 116 cases (70.3%), 34 cases (20.6%), 10 cases (6.1%), and 5 cases (3.0%) were classified as definite APS, probable APS, seronegative APS, and microangiopathic APS (MAPS) respectively. Among 124 patients accompanied with other diseases, 113 (91.1%) were autoimmune diseases, mostly systemic lupus erythematosus (79.6%). 121 (73.3%) patients had episodes of thrombosis, with majority of deep vein thrombosis. The patients with positive test of lupus anticoagulant (LA) only were more likely to have episodes of thrombosis than with positive anticardiolipid antibody (ACL) only (86.0% versus 55.7%; P < 0.05). Among 61 patients with prolonged APTT, the presence of LA was detected in 50 (82.0%) patients, and ACL in 34 (55.7%) patients. CONCLUSION: APS patients could be classified into several subgroups according to their clinical features. Venous thromboses are more common than arterial thromboses, and positive of LA correlates thrombosis more than ACL.
