The paper describes a case of chronic autoimmune hepatitis of type I (CAH-I) that showed an onset accompanied by the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). At the same type, CAH-I ran without both clinical manifestations and the major laboratory syndrome - cytolytic one, which substantially made the diagnosis of a hepatic disease difficult. It is concluded that the clinical manifestations fitting into the APS necessitates meticulous clinical, laboratory, and instrumental studies to find out the underlying disease.
