Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) including lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) IgG and aCL-β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI) complex IG are causative factors for thrombotic event (THE). We retrospectively investigated relationships between aPLs and THE in 458 patients suspected of having antiphospholipid syndrome. THEs were observed in 232 of 458 patients, including 148 cases of venous thrombosis, 59 of arterial thrombosis, 18 of microthrombosis, and 20 of complications of pregnancy. The frequency of THE was significantly high in patients positive for LA and/or aPL. In patients with autoimmune disease (AID), the frequency of THE was significantly high in patients with any types of aPLs. Additionally, risk of THE was significantly increased in patients with more than two types of aPLs. Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time indicated a high risk for THE. However, neither thrombocytopenia nor AID was a risk for THE. In conclusion, the presence of aPL is an indicator for high risk of THE in patients in whom THE was suspected. However, the risk of THE in aPL-positive patients varied among patients with different underlying diseases.
