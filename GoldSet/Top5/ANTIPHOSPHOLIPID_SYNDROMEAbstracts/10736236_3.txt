Pregnant women with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are prone to recurrent miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction and premature delivery. Placental dysfunction may account for these complications yet the mechanisms remain uncertain. Amongst these, an inflammatory response in the placental vasculature could play a role, involving recruitment of neutrophils and platelets and the increased endothelial expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAM), central to the recruitment process. The aim of this study was primarily to investigate CAM expression in the fetoplacental vasculature in women with SLE/APS. Circulating maternal concentrations of soluble CAM were also elucidated. There were no differences in CAM immunostaining in placentae from patients with SLE and/or APS compared with controls. In both patients and controls moderate immunostaining for the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was observed in placental vascular endothelium and mild immunostaining was present in the placental villous stroma. Strong immunostaining for platelet endothelial CAM (PECAM) occured in the placental vascular endothelium whereas P-selectin was mildly expressed in the stem vessel endothelium only. Vascular CAM-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin were undetectable in either study or control placentae. In contrast, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 but not E-selectin, as assessed by immunoassay (ELISA), were elevated in maternal serum from SLE/APS patients compared with controls. This study suggests that upregulation of CAM expression and subsequent activation of neutrophil and/or platelet activity within the placental villous tree is unlikely to be a mechanism by which the adverse pregnancy outcome arises in SLE/APS pregnancies. However, maternal endothelial cell activation (ECA) may play a more important role.
