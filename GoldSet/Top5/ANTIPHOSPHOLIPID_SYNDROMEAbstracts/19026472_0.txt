 INTRODUCTION: Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) can be associated with numerous infectious and particularly Q fever. Data on the pathogenicity of aPL in the course of acute Q fever are scarce. CASE REPORT: We report the case an acute Coxiella burnetii infection associated with clinical and biological manifestations of the aPL syndrome, including a renal infarction. Along with antibiotic treatment, anticoagulation and intravenous immunoglobulins, the clinical outcome was favourable. Antiphospholipid antibodies and Q fever antibody titers had a closely related evolution. CONCLUSION: Arterial thrombosis associated with Q fever and aPL is exceptional. The nosology and potential mechanisms are discussed.
