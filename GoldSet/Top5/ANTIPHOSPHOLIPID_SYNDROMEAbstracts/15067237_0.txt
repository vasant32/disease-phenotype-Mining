During pregnancy, maternal floor infarction (MFI) and massive perivillous fibrin deposition (MFD) often cause fetal growth restriction and death, both being markedly increased by occlusion of the maternal intravenous circulation. Incident rates have been reported to be in the range of 0.09-0.5% and recurrent MFI/MFD might be more frequent in early-onset cases. Thus, prevention measures are necessary for high-risk women who have had MFI/MFD as complications in a previous pregnancy. In this report, the use of oral low-dose aspirin at the early trimester and low-molecular-weight heparin drip infusion from the mid-second trimester was examined for this purpose.
