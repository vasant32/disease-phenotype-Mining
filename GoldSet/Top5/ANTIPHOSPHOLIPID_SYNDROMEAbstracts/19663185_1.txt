AIM: To study effects of the disease activity and comorbid chronic conditions on the incidence of mental disorders in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treated in the State Institute of Rheumatology, RAMS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 115 patients with documented SLE (age 24-45 years, median 34 years, SLE duration 4-17, median 8 years) participated in the study. SLE activity was evaluated by SLEDAI scale, atherosclerosis--by ultrasonic arterial dopplerography, mental disorders--by psychological and psychic scales according to IDC-10. RESULTS: Mental disorders were detected in 76 of 115 (66%) patients: anxiety and depression (83%), depression episodes (40%), maladaptation (24%), generalized anxiety (10%), dysthymia (9%). Manifest cognitive disorders were seen in 7% of examinees. SLE patients with and without mental disorders did not differ by age, gender, SLE duration and activity, cumulative doses of glucocorticoids and cytotoxic drugs, but differed by diagnosed atherosclerosis (23 and 8%, respectively). All SLE patients with the history of myocardial infarction had mental disorders. SLE patients with antiphospholipid syndrome had mental disorders in 85%, while controls--in 49%. CONCLUSION: Mental disorders are found frequently in SLE patients (66%). 83% of these disorders are anxiodepressive. Incidence of mental disorders in SLE patients do not correlate with age, gender, SLE duration and activity, doses of glucocorticoids and cytotoxic drugs, but correlate with comorbid diseases (atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, acute cerebral attacks, antiphospholipid syndrome and Sjogren's syndrome.
