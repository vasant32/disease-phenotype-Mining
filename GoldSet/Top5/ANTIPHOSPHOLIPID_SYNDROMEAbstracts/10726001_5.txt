In an effort to identify alleles associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome, we studied the G20210A polymorphism (the G-->A mutation at nucleotide position 20210) in the 3'-untranslated region of the prothrombin gene in a group of 14 patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome. We did not find any patient with the mutated gene. Since the prothrombin mutation is more prevalent in white populations, this finding may be related with the genetic composition of the Mexican mestizos, in whom the white component is low. The polymorphism of the prothrombin gene in Mexican mestizo patients with antiphospholipid syndrome does not seem to be related to the thrombophilia observed in these patients.
