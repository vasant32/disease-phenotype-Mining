 OBJECTIVE: To examine whether there were any differences in the endocrinological profiles during conception cycle and early pregnancy between a control group and women with a history of recurrent miscarriage that was caused by antiphospholipid syndrome and that was treated with aspirin and low molecular weight heparin. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Recurrent Miscarriage Clinic, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in a tertiary care centre. PATIENT(S): Five women with recurrent pregnancy loss were recruited as cases, whereas another five women having natural cycle donor insemination were used as control. INTERVENTION(S): Serial measurement of serum beta-hCG, activin A, and inhibin A was performed from postovulatory day 12 until 11 weeks of gestation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Comparison of levels of beta-hCG, activin A, and inhibin A at the time of conception onwards till 11 weeks in the two groups. RESULT(S): There were no significant differences between the two groups. CONCLUSION(S): There does not appear to be any obvious endocrinological alteration in the conception cycle of women with antiphospholipid syndrome compared with a control group. Furthermore, the initiation of heparin does not produce a significant change in activin A and inhibin A levels.
