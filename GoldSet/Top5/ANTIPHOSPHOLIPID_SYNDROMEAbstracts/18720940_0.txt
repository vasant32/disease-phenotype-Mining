Superior Mesenteric Artery thrombosis can lead to acute mesenteric ischaemia with devastating consequences. The main dilemma for the surgeon is the delay in diagnosis and a definitive treatment, as these patients may present with signs of peritonism but not frank peritonitis until the ischaemia results in infarction and or perforation. We report a detailed literature search and a unique case of jejunal ischaemia in the setting of undiagnosed Antiphospholipid Syndrome and Factor V Leiden heterozygosity where a delayed diagnosis resulted in an unnecessary prolongation of patient's morbidity.
