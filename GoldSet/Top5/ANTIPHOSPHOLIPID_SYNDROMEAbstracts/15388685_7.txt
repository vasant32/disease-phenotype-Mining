 BACKGROUND: Couples with recurrent miscarriages make several visits to specialized clinics for investigations before treatment is offered. Consequently, 'the interval' between receipt of referral and advice to try for a pregnancy is often lengthy. The objectives of this study were to examine the effect of a 'one-stop' clinic on 'the interval', throughput and the outcome from this clinic. METHODS: The processes for investigation, management and outcomes of 189 couples seen in our Recurrent Miscarriage Clinic (RMC) and their records were reviewed. RESULTS: The one-stop clinic reduced the interval and number of visits by 36% (206.6 to 130.4 days, P < 0.001) and by 60% (2.5 to 1, P < 0.002) respectively. The prevalence and frequency of aetiological factors were similar in those with two and three or more miscarriages (41% versus 45%, P > 0.05). The commonest aetiological factors were thrombophilias (14%) and antiphospholipid syndrome (11%). No cause was identified in 54% of cases. The pregnancy and live birth rates were best in the idiopathic group (75%), those with thrombophilias (64%) and autoimmune antibodies (83%). Older couples had the worse pregnancy rates and outcome. CONCLUSION: A one-stop clinic significantly shortens 'the interval' between referral and initiation of treatment. Investigations should be initiated in women after two consecutive miscarriages.
