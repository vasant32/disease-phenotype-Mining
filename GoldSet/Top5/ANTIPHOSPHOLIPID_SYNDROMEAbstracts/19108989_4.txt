 OBJECTIVE: Inflammation might represent a second hit for anti-phospholipid antibody (aPL)-mediated thrombosis. Inflammatory responses have been linked to gene polymorphisms of several cytokines and Toll Like Receptors (TLRs). We examined IL1 beta, TNFalpha, TGFbeta, IL6, IFN gamma, IL10, tlr4 gene polymorphisms in a family with several members positive for IgG anti-beta2 glycoprotein I (beta 2GPI) antibodies but with recurrent thrombosis in one member only. METHODS: Lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin, anti-beta 2GPI IgG/IgM antibodies, IL1beta, TNFalpha, TGF beta1, IL6, IL10, IFN gamma, tlr4 gene polymorphisms (by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction) in addition to standard thrombophilic risk factors and cytokine serum levels (IL-1 beta, TNFalpha, IL-10) were evaluated. RESULTS: Recurrent thrombotic events was reported only in the proband, but not in three healthy siblings persistently positive for IgG anti-beta2GPI antibodies, respectively. The wild type tlr4 gene and cytokine polymorphisms associated with a high pro-inflammatory response (IL-1 beta promoter-511C/T; TNFalpha G/A; TGFbeta+10T/C, +25C/G; IL-6 -174C/G) were found only in the proband. Serum cytokine levels were normal. CONCLUSION: This case report confirms that protective tlr4 gene polymorphisms are more frequent in asymptomatic aPL carriers. In line with the role of inflammatory mediators as second hits for aPL-associated thrombosis, the polymorphisms of cytokines linked to higher inflammatory response were found in the proband only.
