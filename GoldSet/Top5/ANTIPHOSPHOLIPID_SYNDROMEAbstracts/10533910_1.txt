A 32-year-old male dialysis patient with lupus nephritis was admitted because of shunt obstruction. The arteriovenous fistula was reconstructed, but obstruction recurred twice within several hours after surgery. A high blood level of anticardiolipin beta2-glycoprotein I antibody suggested that shunt obstruction was caused by a thrombotic tendency related to the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Accordingly, for the third shunt procedure, antiplatelet therapy (which had been commenced for systemic lupus erythematosus) was combined with dalteparin sodium from before surgery and warfarin was added postoperatively. This regimen prevented shunt obstruction. In conclusion, hemodialysis patients who suffer repeated shunt obstruction should be examined for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
