Extensive cutaneous necrosis (ECN) associated with antiphospholipid antibodies is a rare presentation. We describe 2 patients with ECN and high titers of anticardiolipin antibodies. The mechanism by which these antibodies act has not been established and there is still controversy regarding treatment of these patients without established guidelines. In the few documented cases the use of pulse steroid therapy, anticoagulants, fibrinolytic agents, plasmapheresis, or a combination of them has shown some benefit. Early recognition and treatment of the antiphospholipid syndrome may limit the extent of thrombotic complications that can result in tissue necrosis.
