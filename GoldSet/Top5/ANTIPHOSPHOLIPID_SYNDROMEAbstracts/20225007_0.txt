A 45-year-old Chinese woman with active systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus anticoagulant positive, was admitted to our hospital. Electrocardiography on admission was normal. Though anti-Sj√∂gren's syndrome A (anti SS-A/Ro) antibodies were negative and ultrasound cardiographic findings were normal, she developed various arrhythmias/conduction disturbances shortly after starting corticosteroid. Nearly all were resolved with continuous corticosteroid and aspirin therapy before discharge. Vasculitis, the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, and platelet aggregation due to corticosteroid were possible mechanisms underlying the arrhythmias/conduction disturbances.
