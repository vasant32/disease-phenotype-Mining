A 51-year-old man with a history of portal vein thrombosis, was examined because of elevated liver tests and a tumoral mass in the liver hilus. Computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the portal vein thrombosis and an infiltrating mass in the porta hepatis with compression on the common bile duct. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed an irregular narrowing of the mid-part of the common bile duct. The patient was referred for explorative laparotomy, which revealed a hypervascular mass in the liver hilus surrounded by many blood vessels. The diagnosis of portal cavernoma was made. Further haematological examination for the cause of portal vein thrombosis revealed an anti-phospholipid syndrome as well as myeloproliferative disease. Oral anticoagulant treatment is started. In conclusion, we report a case of biliary stricture due to portal vein thrombosis and cavernoma (portal biliopathy) which was not diagnosed preoperatively. Biliary strictures associated with portal vein thrombosis are due to extrinsic compression by collaterals and can also be induced by ischemic injury secondary to venous and arterial thrombosis of the choledochal vascular plexus.
