A 39-year-old woman was admitted with abdominal pain and dyspnea, and a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus with renal involvement was established. Laboratory tests revealed highly elevated anticardiolipin antibody, thrombocytopenia and false positive VDRL. Generalized thrombus formation and Libman-Sacks endocarditis were found at postmortem examination. The pancreas showed chronic inflammation with thrombi in pancreatic arteries, but no vasculitic change was observed. Lowering of pancreatic blood flow because of arterial thrombi was a possible cause of pancreatitis in this patient. The spectrum of antiphospholipid antibody associated diseases may be extended to include pancreatitis as a thrombotic complication.
