Primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) is an autoimmune disorder manifested by recurrent thrombosis in the venous and arterial system. We report a group of seven patients with lower limb ischaemia associated with PAPS. Four were male patients and three were females, with a mean age of 37 years. All had a previous deep vein thrombosis and the majority, five out of seven, had a prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Prolonged activated thromboplastin time was demonstrated in all our patients and PAPS was established by positive thromboplastin titration index, circulating anticoagulant index and increased anticardiolipin levels. Symptoms included claudication in three, rest pain in four and gangrene in five patients. Angiography demonstrated thrombosis of various segments of the arterial tree including: aorta, iliac, femoral and popliteal arteries. Two patients were treated conservatively and one by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the distal aorta. A total of eleven vascular surgical procedures were performed in four patients resulting in early postoperative thrombosis (2h-30 days) in 10 cases. Only one graft remained patent, when full heparinisation (1000 units/h) was used perioperatively. We conclude that PAPS patients are at high risk for graft thrombosis and should only be operated upon on full anticoagulation, starting at operation and proceeding indefinitely.
