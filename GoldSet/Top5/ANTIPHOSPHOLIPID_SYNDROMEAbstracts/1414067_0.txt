The Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) is an immunoglobulin directed towards the phospholipid portion of the prothrombin activator complex. This immunoglobulin because first identified in the plasma of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematodes, was named as Lupus Anticoagulant. Although initially described in patients with SLE, it was subsequently observed in other diseases and also in patients without any manifest disease. SLE or similar diseases are present in 35% of LA (+) patients. The LA prevalence in SLE patients has been found as 34% whereas ACA prevalence was found as 44%. While searching for the presence of LA and the levels of APA in cases having unexplained recurrent fetal losses, a family (a mother and 3 daughters) was discovered, whose each member has been diagnosed as SLE at different times and with different symptoms. Data suggesting the presence of LA and high APA levels were determined in all the members of the family and also it was realised that cause who had recurrent fetal losses had the highest APA levels. In addition to immunoassay methods to detect APA, examination of coagulation tests in patients with unexplained thrombosis and/or fetal losses, would be of great help.
