 INTRODUCTION: Recurrent miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies with the same biological father in the first trimester, and affects 1-2% of women, half of whom have no identifiable cause. Overall, 75% of affected women will have a successful subsequent pregnancy, but this rate falls for older mothers and with increasing number of miscarriages. Antiphospholipid syndrome, with anticardiolipin or lupus anticoagulant antibodies, is present in 15% of women with recurrent first and second trimester miscarriage. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for unexplained recurrent miscarriage? What are the effects of treatments for recurrent miscarriage caused by antiphospholipid syndrome? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to April 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aspirin (low dose), bed rest, corticosteroids, early scanning in subsequent pregnancies, heparin plus low-dose aspirin, human chorionic gonadotrophin, intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, lifestyle adaptation, oestrogen, paternal white cell immunisation, progesterone, trophoblastic membrane infusion, and vitamin supplementation.
