PURPOSE/METHODS: We report a 34-year-old woman with sytemic lupus erythematosus (S.L.E.) and antiphospholipidic syndrome which presented severe ischaemic retinopathy and neovascular proliferation. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: We achieved no progression of the disease and stabilization of visual acuity with panphotocoagulation. We recommend periodic ophtalmologic exams because of the scarce symptomatology.
