 INTRODUCTION: Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is an immune thrombophylia of unknown etiology which leads to vascular thrombosis and gestational complications. CLINICAL REPORT: A 27-year old woman who had been diagnosed APS four years before was admitted in the Emergency Room five days after a spontaneous delivery due to [corrected] pain in the upper right abdominal quadrant. Blood analysis revealed AST and ALT rise and thrombocytopenia. CT scan was suggestive of liver infarction due to venous ischemia. Abdominal eco-doppler diagnosed vena porta left branch thrombosis and compensatory arterial circulation. Treatment included low molecular weight heparin and corticosteroids which led to progressive clinical, laboratory and imagiological recovery. DISCUSSION: Portal venous system thrombosis is extremely rare in the absence of local risk factors and the most common and catastrophic complication is intestinal necrosis.
