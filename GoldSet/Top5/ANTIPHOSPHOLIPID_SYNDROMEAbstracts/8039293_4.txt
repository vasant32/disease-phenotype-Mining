We report a 14-year-old boy with systemic lupus erythematosus and anticardiolipin antibodies. He developed asymptomatic superior vena cava thrombosis and silent pulmonary embolism. Computed tomographic scan of his chest and abdomen showed features of long standing obstruction secondary to superior vena cava thrombosis. Asymptomatic thrombosis of the major vessels and silent pulmonary emboli are part of the disease spectrum of pediatric antiphospholipid syndrome.
