The neurological manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are diverse. Transverse myelitis (TM) is an uncommon, but well-known neurological complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). On the other hand, the reported cases associated with primary APS are extremely rare. To our knowledge, this is the first report of TM in a patient with primary APS in Korea. A 32-year-old male patient was admitted with the sudden onset of numbness, a tingling sensation, and weakness in both lower extremities. He had a 19 months history of external iliac and femoral arterial thromboses prior to admission. The laboratory results indicated the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies of the IgG class and lupus anticoagulant. No other autoantibodies were detected and there were no apparent clinical manifestations of SLE or multiple sclerosis. A T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) image showed swelling and increased intensity of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord between C6 and T7 with slight enhancement by contrast medium. After steroid pulse therapy, the patient's symptoms were gradually relieved and the abnormal findings on MR imaging disappeared.
