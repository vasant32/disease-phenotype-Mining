Pregnancy gingivitis is developed in 30-75% of cases and it is a result of complicated hormonal and immunological changes in the organism. 100 pregnant women with various degree of severity of gingivitis have been observed. Acute generalized gingivitis, gingival edema with bleeding, hyperplasia, have been observed in all patients, while in bad cases - with ulcers' formation at gingival. Decrease of hemoreological index of gingival tissue (down to 0,15-0,19 Ohm) have been mentioned, too. Complete clinical and laboratory studies, as well as screening of obtained data have been carried out before the treatment, in its process and after the course. Pregnant women have been under the supervision, to whom according to various indications (rhesus-imcompatibility, antiphospholipidic syndrome, early interruption of pregnancy with disorder of the system of hemostasis basically towards hypercoagulation) has been carried out curative discrete plasmapheresis. All pregnant women have been diagnosed by the gingivitis of varying severity. After completion of curative course of plasmapheresis has been carried out evaluation of patients' condition. It has been reached improvement of subjective and objective data, regulation of hemoreological data in gingival tissue (0,21-0,23 Ohm). Respectively, the period of recurrence-free course of disease have been increased and the quality of patients' life have been improved.
