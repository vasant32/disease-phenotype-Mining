A child suffered bilateral thalamic infarction secondary to Sneddon and antiphospholipid antibody syndromes. Her initial findings of hypersomnolence, mood disturbance, and amnesia are characteristic of bilateral thalamic infarction. Clinical and laboratory evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of both Sneddon and antiphospholipid antibody syndromes as the cause of her unusual stroke. The treatment of this patient, based on experience with adult patients, was long-term, high-intensity warfarin anticoagulation.
