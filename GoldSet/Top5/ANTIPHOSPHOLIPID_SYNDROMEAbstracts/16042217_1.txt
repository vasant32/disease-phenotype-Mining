It has been suggested that multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with positive anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLA) have some atypical features, including absent oligoclonal bands (OCB) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our aim was to compare the frequencies of ACLA and related laboratory and clinical features in OCB negative (OCB-) and positive (OCB+) MS patients. We compared 41 OCB- patients attending a MS Clinic in a tertiary referral center, with 206 OCB+ patients. ACLA, anti-beta2-glycoprotein and other autoantibodies, lupus anticoagulant and coagulation markers were measured. We found a higher frequency of ACLA in OCB- patients, 18/41 versus 33/206 in OCB+ patients (P<0.0001). OCB- patients had more progressive MS than OCB+ subjects. There were no differences in age, sex, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, antiphospholipid syndrome symptoms between the groups. ACLA+ MS patients were more frequently in the OCB- group. Although this may suggest that they represent a special subgroup of MS, no other clinical or laboratory findings distinguish the groups. Although OCB- MS patients may be thought to be less active immunologically, this study shows they have more frequently ACLA than OCB+ patients. OCB- MS patients in our cohort do not appear to have a more benign form of MS, as has previously been suggested.
