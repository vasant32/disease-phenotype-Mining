Idiopathic thrombotycopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder in which circulating autoantibodies react with target antigens on the platelet membrane. In order to identify the autoimmune response in ITP, two MAIPA (Monoclonal Antibody (MAb) Immobilization of Platelet Antigen) assays (MAIPA I and MAIPA II) were performed on sera from thrombocytopenic patients. In the classic MAIPA assay (MAIPA I), control platelets were incubated simultaneously with human serum and a mouse MAb to a platelet glycoprotein. In MAIPA II, the control platelets were incubated first with the human serum and then, after washing, with the selected mouse MAb. A positive MAIPA I test but a negative MAIPA II has been shown to result from the presence of serum antibodies recognizing mouse MAb to platelet glycoproteins used in the assay. We compared the frequency of such 'anti-mouse' antibodies in patients with thrombocytopenia associated or not with other autoimmune states and in healthy donors with a normal platelet count. Statistically significant differences were found in the incidence of anti-mouse antibodies between patients and healthy donors. Furthermore, the identity of the targeted mouse MAbs varied in sera from the patients. The detected anti-mouse antibodies may include anti-idiotypic antibodies produced against cross-reactive idiotypes shared by human and mouse anti-platelet antibodies.
