We present a young man who sustained an acute myocardial infarction with hemodynamic instability requiring placement of a left ventricular assist device and subsequent cardiac transplantation. Hematologic work-up revealed anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of severe acute heart failure due to anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome in which the patient survived through assist device placement and successful transplantation.
