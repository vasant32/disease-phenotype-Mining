The coagulation activity of plasma phospholipid membranes (PM) was measured in plasma depleted for platelets (PDP) in 50 normal subjects and 33 patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and the "lupus anticoagulant" in the plasma. The normal value for phospholipid activation of clotting was 99.8 +/- 3.5% (from 75 to 125%), whereas in patients with APS and lupus anticoagulant it was 42.1 +/- 8.2% (p < 0.001). Addition of PM from patients' PDP to normal plasma free from PM did not normalize clotting. Addition of PM from normal plasma to patients' PDP normalized the clotting time. Therapy with discrete plasmapheresis increased the phospholipid activation value in the patients from 42.1 to 73.3% (p < 0.01), which was due to removal of the PM-antiphospholipid antibody complex from PDP. The proposed microfiltration method can be used in the complex of tests for detecting the lupus anticoagulant in patient's plasma.
