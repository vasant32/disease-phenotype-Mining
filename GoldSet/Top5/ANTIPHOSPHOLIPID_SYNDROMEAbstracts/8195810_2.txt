Paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 70 patients with inflammatory and non-inflammatory neurological diseases, as well as 10 sera from patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAS), six of which presented with cerebrovascular ischemic syndromes, were studied for the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) of the G and M classes. PAS sera and some selected paired CSF and serum specimens, were also analyzed for the presence of anti-phosphatidylserine (PS) and anti-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) antibodies. High levels of IgG and IgM ACA were synthesized intrathecally only in patients with neurosyphilis. Patients with other infectious or inflammatory neurological diseases very rarely showed detectable levels of ACA in serum and/or CSF. ACA were found not only in patients with untreated PAS but also in the serum of 3/7 patients with migraine, thus confirming a relationship between ACA and vascular disorders. The search for PS and PE antibodies disclosed that in PAS patients the serum titers of these antibodies mirrored ACA IgG and IgM titers, while they were never found in the CSF.
