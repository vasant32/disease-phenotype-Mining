We report on two patients who have high titres of antiphospholipid antibodies, both of whom had acute audiovestibular failure. One of the patients had systemic lupus erythematosus. The other patient had primary antiphospholipid syndrome: audiovestibular symptoms have not been reported in this condition. The occurrence of acute audiovestibular failure in the primary antiphospholipid syndrome raises the question as to whether patients presenting with acute deafness or vestibular disturbance should be screened for the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies.
