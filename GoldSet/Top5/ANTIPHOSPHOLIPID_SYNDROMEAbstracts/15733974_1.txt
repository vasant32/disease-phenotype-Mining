BACKGROUND: We present a case of an atypical onset of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). CASE: A woman in her 15th week gestation had a thrombosis of an unknown cerebral cavernoma, which was successfully removed. Twenty-six days after, she was admitted for a severe pain in right hypochondrium and a second class HELLP syndrome was diagnosed. Two days after, she had a fetal loss. After 1 month, laboratory tests revealed high level of antiphospholipid antibodies. At the same time, she developed a spontaneous thrombosis at her right arm. After 6 weeks, antiphospholipid antibodies, tested again, result positive. CONCLUSION: Antiphospholipid antibodies often cause pregnancy complications, but, to our knowledge, this is the first report of an association of antiphospholipid antibodies, with cerebral cavernoma thrombosis and early onset HELLP syndrome.
