Antiphospholipid antibodies are generally associated with Antiphospholipid Syndrome, which can occur as a primary disorder or may be secondary to connective tissue disease or tumour. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with tumour disease is responsible for thrombotic complications. In a population of 53 tumor patients with positive carcinoembryonic antigen CEA, carbohydrate antigen CA19.9, CA125 and CA15.3 markers, IgM and IgG anticardiolipin and antiphosphatidylinositol were detected by solid-phase immunoassays. Our results show that moderate or high levels of antiphospholipid antibodies are present in a great number of patients with CEA and CA19.9 markers, suggesting a specific association with gastroenteric tumors. By testing for antiphosphatidylinositol antibodies, many patients not evidenced by the standard anticardiolipin assay were found to be antiphospholipid-positive. The analysis of antiphosphatidylinositol antibodies as a diagnostic tool in gastroenteric cancer to highlight patients with the risk of thromboembolic complications is discussed.
