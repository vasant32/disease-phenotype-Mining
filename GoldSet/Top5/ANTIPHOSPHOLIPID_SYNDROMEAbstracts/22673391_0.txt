In this paper we review recent studies and consensus documents that we consider relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The diagnosis of APS is based on the Sydney classification criteria (2006), in which positive laboratory tests (anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-Î²2-glycoprotein I antibodies or lupus anticoagulant) are mandatory. However, it is not uncommon to see patients with clinical features highly suggestive of the syndrome in whom these antibodies are persistently negative. Therefore, we summarise the principal clinical and serological findings in a subgroup of patients with seronegative APS in the first series published up to date. In addition, a recent study draws attention to the safety and efficacy of the long-term use of low-molecular-weight heparins in patients with APS not susceptible to warfarin treatment. There is also a subgroup of women with APS and recurrent foetal loss with no response to the standard antithrombotic therapy; in this group the materno-foetal prognosis could be improved by the addition of low-dose prednisolone during the first trimester of pregnancy. Finally, we list the principal recommendations regarding thromboprophylaxis in APS drawn from the expert consensus document elaborated at the meeting held in Galvestone (2010).
