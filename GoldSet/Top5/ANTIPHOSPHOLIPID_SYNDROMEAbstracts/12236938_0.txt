OBJECTIVE: To report the prevalence of acute cerebrovascular accidents (ACVA) and risk factors for thrombosis among patients diagnosed of primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPLS) and to compare this group with that of patients with PAPLS but not ACVA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective data analysis of 30 patients consecutively diagnosed of PAPLS. Episodes of ACVA were quantitated and other cardiovascular risk factors were determined. RESULTS: Thirty percent of patients (9/30) had one or more ACVA. No significant differences were found when the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors in both groups was compared. CONCLUSIONS: Antiphospholipid antibodies in young patients with ACVA should be determined, although some other cardiovascular risk factors may coexist.
