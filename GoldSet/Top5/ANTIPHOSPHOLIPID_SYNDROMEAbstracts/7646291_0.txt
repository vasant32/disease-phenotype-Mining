The authors report the case of a 10 year old child who presented with an uncomplicated deep venous thrombosis associated with an antiphospholipid syndrome. The diagnosis was established by the finding of spontaneous prolongation of the activated cephalin time, the finding of a lupus-like antibody and an anti-cardiolipin antibody. The clinical outcome was good with oral anticoagulants but a recurrence was observed when they were stopped. The authors discuss the question of the duration of preventive therapy.
