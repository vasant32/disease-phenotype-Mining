 OBJECTIVE: To compare the 2 most efficacious therapeutic regimens, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and anticoagulation with low molecular weight (LMW) heparin plus low-dose aspirin, in women with recurrent pregnancy loss associated with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). METHODS: We examined 40 women with recurrent abortion (at least 3 occurrences) and repeatedly positive test results for anticardiolipin or lupus anticoagulant. The subjects were randomly assigned to treatment with IVIG or LMW heparin plus low-dose aspirin. Both therapies were started when the women were pregnant as documented by a positive urine test. IVIG was stopped at the thirty-first week of gestation, aspirin at the thirty-fourth week, and heparin at the thirty-seventh week. The primary outcome of interest was the rate of live births with the 2 treatments. RESULTS: The characteristics of the 2 groups were similar at the time of randomization. The women treated with LMW heparin plus low-dose aspirin had a higher rate of live births (84%) than those treated with IVIG (57%). CONCLUSION: Treatment with LMW heparin plus low-dose aspirin should be considered as the standard therapy for recurrent pregnancy loss due to aPL.
