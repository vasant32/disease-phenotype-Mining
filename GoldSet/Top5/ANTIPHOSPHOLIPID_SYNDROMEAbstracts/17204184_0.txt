To understand the characteristics of T cell receptors recognizing antiphospholipid syndrome associated antigen, the characteristics of T cells were analyzed using T cell receptor beta variable region (TCRbetaV) gene spectrotyping in a case of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The results indicated that in the case of APS there were 2 dominant T cell clones. The TCRbetaVs sequences of the 2 T cell clones showed the TCRbetaVs belonged to 8 and 23 gene families respectively. The peptides of third complementarity-determining regions (CDR3) in the TCRbetaVs were CASSLLVAGGPRAYNEQFFGPG and CASSLAGFGQPQHFGDG. Comparing the motifs in CDR3 with another autoimmune disease, the motif YNEQFFGPG in TCRbetaV8 and motif QHFGDG in TCRbetaV23 were identical with that of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and systemic lupus erythematosus reported before. In conclusion, some T cell clones proliferating in these autoimmune diseases may recognize the same antigens.
