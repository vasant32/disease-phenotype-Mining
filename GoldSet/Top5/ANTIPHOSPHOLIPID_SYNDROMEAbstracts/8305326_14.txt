The development of extensive cutaneous necrosis in a patient with tumour-stage mycosis fungoides is described. Skin biopsies showed a lymphomatous infiltrate, and thrombosis of dermal blood vessels. Investigation revealed the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies, a lupus anticoagulant, and low free protein S, which contributed to a prothrombotic state. Antiphospholipid antibodies have been detected in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but clinical manifestations are uncommon. Such autoantibodies may be produced by neoplastic lymphoid cells. The frequency with which antiphospholipid antibodies occur in mycosis fungoides is currently unknown.
