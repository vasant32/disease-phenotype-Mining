Antiphospholipid (Hughes') syndrome (APS) has not been reported in African-Americans (A-A) as frequently as in other ethnic groups. We describe eight A-A female patients with APS, including two cases of primary APS (PAPS), four with APS secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), one with Sj√∂gren's syndrome, and one with overlap connective tissue disease (CTD). Their mean age was 34 y (range 24-47 y). Patients were followed for a mean of 6 y (range 0.3-11 y). During follow up, both anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2glycoprotein-I (abeta2GPI) antibodies were measured in stored sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IgA was the most frequent isotype of aCL and abeta2GPI, and co-occurred with the IgM isotype in three of four patients with neurologic manifestations.
