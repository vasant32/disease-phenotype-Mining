The aim of the study was to prove the incidence of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in systemic connective tissue disease (SCTD), especially in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to find out serologic markers of APS. Of 94 patients with SCTD followed up in the last three years 80 had SLE, 7 Sjogren's syndrome, 3 systemic vasculitis, 2 combined systemic connective tissue disease, 1 rheumatoid arthritis, 1 Sjogren's syndrome with vasculitis. Antiphospholipid antibodies (ApSt) were determined by ELISA method. In 31 of 80 patients with SLE (38.07%) antiphospholipid antibodies were proved. In lo of 31 (32.26%) signs of systemic lupus or the presence of APS markers have not been found, while 21 of 31 (67.74%) had some of clinical manifestations of APS (most commonly thrombocytopenia or vascular thrombosis) with evolution of the basic disease. Among our patients with SLE the most common finding was IgG antibody isotype-in 14 or 66.66% of cases. In 5 of 7 patients with Sjogren's syndrome ApAt were proved without clinical evolution of the basic disease and APS. Only 2 of 7 patients of this group showed, together with more increased ApAt, mild evolution of the basic disease and manifestation of APS (livado reticularis and recurrent venous thrombosis).
