Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) often develop leg ulceration, particularly those with antiphospholipid antibodies or with vasculitis. Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an idiopathic ulcerative neutrophilic dermatosis that is commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease or seronegative polyarthritis. Although PG-like lesions have been commonly described in patients with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, the occurrence of PG as a preceding manifestation of SLE has only rarely been reported. We present a patient who developed PG roughly 8 years prior to developing SLE.
