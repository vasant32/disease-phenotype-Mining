A 20-year-old woman was admitted to a Gynecology Hospital in her 6(th) month of pregnancy for high blood pressure and tonic-clonic seizure. Primary diagnosis was eclampsia, and for that reason she underwent cesarean section. She also had headache on frontal and parietal areas without nausea or vomiting. There was not a focal neurological sign. Rheumatology consultation was requested. Systemic lupus erythematosus and secondary antiphospholipid (APS) was confirmed. The patient had headache that continued several days after cesarean section, therefore, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) were performed, and cerebral vein thrombosis was documented. Distal segment of right lateral sinus and sigmoid sinus were not appeared in brain MRV. Abnormal hypersignal intensity of right lateral sinus/coronal T2 was detected. Thrombolytic therapy with 20 mg tissue plasminogen activator on right sigmoid and transverse sinus was performed by an interventional neurologist. After this procedure, the patient(')s headache healed and she was discharged in a good condition.
