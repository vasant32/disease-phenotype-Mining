Cardiac manifestations of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLS) comprise a major complication. Herein we report our surgical treatment of aortic regurgitation in a patient with APLS. A 61-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with symptoms of congestive heart failure. Systemic lupus erythematosus had been diagnosed at the age of 36, and immunosuppressive therapy has been continuously performed. APLS was also diagnosed at the age of 55, after which cardiomegaly was noted on chest radiographs and aortic regurgitation was evident on echocardiography. Although immunosuppressive therapy had been continued, cardiac symptoms began to develop. With a presumed diagnosis of valvular disease associated with autoimmune disease, the aortic valve was replaced with a bioprosthesis. Noninfective endocarditis was confirmed in the excised specimen and was likely involved in APLS. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 26 without complications.
