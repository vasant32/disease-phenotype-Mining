A 12-year-old girl presented with a sudden decrease in her right visual acuity and homonymous hemianopsia. An angiography of the retinal arteries demonstrated recanalized occlusion of the right retinal artery. Cerebral angiography showed bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis associated with the development of collateral circulation. Laboratory evaluations revealed dual antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) positivity [anti-proteinase (anti-PR3) ANCA and anti-myeloperoxidase (anti-MPO) ANCA], anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies, and low titers of antinuclear antibodies (ANA). There was no evidence of active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), ANCA-related vasculitis, or other risk factors for cerebral occlusion, such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Dual positivity for both cytoplasmic (c-ANCA) and perinuclear (p-ANCA) antineutrophil antibodies has been found previously in a small number of reports, but to our knowledge, this case represents the first case of moyamoya disease associated with dual ANCA positivity.
