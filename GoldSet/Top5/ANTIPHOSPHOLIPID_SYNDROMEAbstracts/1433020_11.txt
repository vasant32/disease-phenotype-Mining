We describe 2 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with neurological complications and thrombocytopenia, who, upon further investigation, were found to have thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. While neither patient responded to treatment with corticosteroids, both responded to plasma exchange and intravenous cyclophosphamide. This highlights the need to carefully consider this diagnosis in patients with SLE presenting with neurological complications and thrombocytopenia.
