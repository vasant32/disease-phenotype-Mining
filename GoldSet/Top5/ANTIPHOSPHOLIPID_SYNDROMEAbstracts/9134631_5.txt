We analyzed the clinical features of 36 patients homozygous for the Arg 506 to Gln factor V mutation and found a circumstantial event at risk for thrombosis in 29 of the 31 patients with thrombosis. The most frequent predisposing factors were the post-partum period and the use of oral contraceptives in women, and surgery in both sexes. Venous thrombosis recurred in 48% of the patients. One patient had a myocardial infarction at age 33 years, and also had an antiphospholipid syndrome. Homozygous Gln 506 mutation leads to far less severe thrombotic complications than homozygous protein C and protein S deficiencies and does not seem to predispose patients to arterial thrombosis.
