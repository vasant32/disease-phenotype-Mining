The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I antibodies (abeta2GPI) in patients with celiac disease and to analyze the clinical features of antiphospholipid syndrome in these patients. We conducted a prospective case-control study based on the evaluation of IgG, IgM and IgA aCL, and IgG and IgA abeta2GPI in celiac disease patients and in controls. All patients were asked about any occurrence of thrombotic manifestations. In addition, women were asked about pregnancy morbidity. Fifty celiac disease patients and 50 healthy controls were studied. IgM aCL were not detected in study group or in controls. IgG aCL were found in two patients and in one control. IgA aCL were significantly more frequent in celiac disease patients compared with controls (13/50 (26%) vs. 2/50 (4%), p=0.004, OR [95% CI]=9.09 [1.81-50]). There was no statistically significant difference for the prevalence of IgG and IgA abeta2GPI between patients and controls. Clinical features of antiphospholipid syndrome were noted in two patients with negative antibodies. Prevalence of IgM and IgG aCL and of abeta2GPI were not increased in celiac disease. IgA aCL were more frequently detected in celiac disease. However, no clinical features of antiphospholipid syndrome were noted.
