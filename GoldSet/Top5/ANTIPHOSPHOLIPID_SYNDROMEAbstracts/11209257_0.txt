The incidence of hepatitis B and C virus and cytomegalovirus infection is high in patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The specific features of virus infection in APS patients are determined by the activity of APS. During clinically manifest stage, the activities of aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and alkaline phosphatase increase, while during remission only aspartate aminotransferase and LDH levels remain high, for this latter enzyme high activities of isoenzymes LDH5 and LDH4 being recorded. These data indicate that the pathological process in APS involves not only the liver, but the sinusoidal endothelium as well. This seems to account for some other clinical and laboratory manifestations of APS, such as increased level of circulating immune complexes, dysfunction of physiological anticoagulants, etc.
