BACKGROUND: To evaluate the incidence of thrombophilic disorders such as Factor II mutation, Leiden factor V and MTHFR genotype, and anti-phospholipid anti-bodies syndrome in women with or without pregnancy related problems. METHODS: Sixty-three patients (group A) with pregnancy complications were included in the study and tested for Factor V mutation, Factor II mutation, 5-10 MTHFR reductase mutation and anti-phospholipid antibodies syndrome. The incidence of disorders was compared with thirty-six pregnancies without complications (control study, group B). RESULTS: Hemostasis thrombophilic like disorders, were significantly high (p=0.001 vs group B). Nobody in both groups was homozygous for Leiden mutation or prothrombin mutation (Factor II). The prevalence of Factor V mutation in heterozygosis was significantly (p=0.01) higher in group A in comparison with group B. The MTHFR mutation in homozygosis was found in 21.4% of group A while in the control group it was 11%. Factor II mutation in heterozygosis and anti-phospholipid antibodies were found only in group A. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to evaluate the hemocoagulation patterns in women with a history of complicated pregnancies.
