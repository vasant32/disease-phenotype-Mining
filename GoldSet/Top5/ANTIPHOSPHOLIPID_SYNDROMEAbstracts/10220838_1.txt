We report two patients with lower limb pitting edema and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who showed immediate response to systemic steroids. In one of the patients, the edema had been present for about 6 months and was the first manifestation of her SLE. In the second patient with a long history of SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome, a thrombosis was suspected, but not confirmed. Only after therapy with steroids did the edema disappear completely. Pitting edema of the lower limb could be a rare manifestation of SLE.
