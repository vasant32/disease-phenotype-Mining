Mitral valve replacement (MVR) was performed on a 36-year-old woman for mitral valve regurgitation. The patient suffered from antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient required 4 times plasma exchanges to prevent embolization to the cerebral arteries. A decrease in the anticardiolipin beta 2-glycoprotein I complex level was achieved and MVR was performed with a relatively good postoperative course. Anticoagulation therapy had been continued, but one year postoperatively the patient fell down a staircase and suffered acute epidural hematoma. Emergency operation was performed. The patient, however, died due to cerebral hemorrhage.
