The anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) are acquired inhibiting antibodies of the coagulation process. They interfere with the anionic phospholipids of the cellular membranous. These are frequently associated to the autoimmune diseases, especially the systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), they expose the patient to thrombotic complications. In order to define the possible and prognostic predictive value of these aCL, a sequential research of these antibodies was performed on 12 patients suffering from SLE since 2 to 11 years. An average of one sample per year was drawn, either during an attack or in a routine control check. The detection of these IgG aCL did not appear to be related with be course of the disease. In fact, 3 of our patients, ill since respectively 2, 7 and 11 years, never showed any aCL. These aCL were positive during an attack in 80% of the cases. This positivity was associated to vascular thrombosis (2 cases), and cutaneous vascularity (6 cases) and, in one case, the presence of aCL was linked to inutero fetal death due to retruplacentary hematoma. This study confirms the association between aCL and thrombosis during systemic lupus erythematosus.
