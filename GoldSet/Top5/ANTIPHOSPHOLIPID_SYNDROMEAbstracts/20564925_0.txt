The paper describes a case of practically simultaneous development of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and the catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) complicated by mesenteric vessel thrombosis and small bowel necrosis. Multimodality treatment comprising volume plasmapheresis, fresh frozen plasma transfusion, hemodialysis, anticoagulant and disaggregant therapy could relieve thrombogenic events, such as pulmonary artery thromboembolism and intestinal necrosis.
