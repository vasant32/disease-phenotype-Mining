Systemic lupus erythromatosus is often associated with an antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). A high prevalence of valvular heart disease in APS leads to increased risk of embolic events, particularly cerebrovascular. We present a patient with cerebral infarction, with positive lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies and factor V Leiden mutation. Echocardiographic examination revealed mitral valve anterior leaflet thickening and verrucous vegetations consistent with Libman-Sacks endocarditis, which is commonly associated with APS.
