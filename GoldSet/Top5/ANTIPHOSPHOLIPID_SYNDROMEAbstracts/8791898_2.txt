Morphological picture of arterial fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) of carotid and cerebral arteries associated with intracranial aneurysm and thrombotic small vessel vasculopathy in a 34-year-old woman with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) is presented. The patient died because of hemorrhage caused by aneurysm rupture. In the walls of the aneurysm and aneurysmal dilatation of middle cerebral artery dysplastic changes of FMD type were found. The case fulfills the clinical and serological criteria of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Microscopic examination of the brain showed occlusion of small cerebral vessels, characteristic for antiphospholipid syndrome. It was caused by fibrin thrombi and endothelial proliferation or fibrous webs in the vessel lumen. Neither features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) nor related autoimmune diseases were observed in the morphological examination of the brain, skin and internal organs. Therefore, it was feasible to confirm the diagnosis of PAPS in the patient with FMD of the large cephalic arteries.
