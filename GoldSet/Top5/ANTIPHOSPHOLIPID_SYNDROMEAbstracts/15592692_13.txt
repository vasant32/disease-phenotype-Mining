Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome is a thrombotic microangiopathy complicating pregnancy and shares many clinical and biological features with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Thrombotic microangiopathy is also a pathological feature of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). An association between refractory HELLP syndrome and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) has been reported in a few cases. We describe a 19-year-old woman with APS and multiorgan failure conforming to a diagnosis of CAPS who developed refractory HELLP syndrome.
