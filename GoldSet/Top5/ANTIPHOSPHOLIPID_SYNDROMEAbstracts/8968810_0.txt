A 48-year-old woman with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) developed pulmonary hypertension without any thromboembolic episode. Multiple pulmonary perfusion defects suggestive of pulmonary thrombosis or in situ thrombosis were observed. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the right femoral vein without symptoms was also detected by contrast venography. Asymptomatic pulmonary hypertension complicated with a hypercoagulable state such as in this case suggests that not only recurrent asymptomatic pulmonary thrombosis, but also in situ thrombosis in pulmonary vessels are possible and important factors in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension.
