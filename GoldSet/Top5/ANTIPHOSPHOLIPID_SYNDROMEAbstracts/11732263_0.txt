27 patients (22 women, 5 men); age 17 to 56 yr. (mean age 37 yr.) were included in this study, 4 had primary antiphospholipid syndrome and 18 secondary antiphospholipid syndrome in the course of systemic connective tissue disease and in 5 cases increased levels of anticardiolipid antibodies were found which did not meet the criteria necessary for diagnosis of secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. The mean duration of the disease was 8 yrs. Among primary antiphospholipid syndrome patients two had ischaemic stroke, one migraine-like headache and seizures. 18 patients had lupus erythematosus, two mixed connective tissue disease, one rheumatoid arthritis, one Sjögren syndrome, one Behçet disease. In 55% of patients migraine-like headache, polyneuropathies, encephalophaties, stroke, seizures and vision disturbances were present. In 18.5% of patients EEG exam revealed focal lesions with tendency for generalisation. On brain stem auditory evoked potentials examination, in 11.1% of patients conductivity lesions in mesencephalon and pons were found, visual evoked potentials, in 11.1% of patients in visual tracts. In 37% of patients, neuropathy was found on EMG exam. Neurological symptoms are one of the most frequent disorders in systemic connective tissue disease associated with the presence of anicardiolipin antibodies.
