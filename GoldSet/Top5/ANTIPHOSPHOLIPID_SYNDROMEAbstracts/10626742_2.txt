Using molecular typing, we evaluated the strength of class II HLA associations in 67 Greek patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), 54 of whom had antibodies against beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI), as compared to 246 controls. To further clarify and delineate HLA associations of the beta2GPI response, we combined these data with individual patient data from three other ethnic groups including an additional 74 patients with beta2GPI response and 403 ethnically matched controls of white, African-American, and Mexican-American origin in a formal meta-analysis. The major alleles associated with anti-beta2GPI response are HLA-DQA1*03 (in particular *0301) and the HLA-DRB1*1302-DQB1*0604 haplotype, while protection against developing an anti-beta2GPI response is related primarily to the HLA-DRB1*0101-DQA1*0101 haplotype and the HLA-DRB1*1101 allele. These effects are not significantly heterogeneous across ethnic groups. The previously observed association with HLA-DQB1*0302 may simply reflect linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DQA1*0301 and the previously reported HLA-DQB1*06 effect is limited to HLA-DQB1*0604/0605, while HLA-DQB1*0602 is unlikely to be important. The meta-analysis clearly documents that the anti-beta2GPI response is determined by a few specific class II alleles and haplotypes.
