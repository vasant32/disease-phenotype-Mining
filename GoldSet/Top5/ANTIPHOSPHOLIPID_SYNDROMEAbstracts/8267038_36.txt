OBJECTIVE: We compared the use of aspirin alone with combined therapy (prednisone plus aspirin) in antiphospholipid antibody-positive obstetric patients with prior adverse pregnancy outcome. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-nine patients meeting specific laboratory and clinical inclusion criteria were randomized to receive either combined therapy (prednisone plus low-dose aspirin, n = 17) or aspirin alone (n = 22). The daily aspirin dose was 81 mg; prednisone was begun at 20 mg/day and increased or decreased on the basis of observed changes in serial antibody levels. Perinatal outcomes were compared between groups. Evaluation of treatment-related maternal complications and serial antibody titers was also accomplished. RESULTS: Thirty-four randomized subjects were evaluable (prednisone plus low-dose aspirin, n = 12 vs aspirin only, n = 22); no perinatal losses were observed in the study cohort. Preterm delivery was experienced by significantly more patients receiving prednisone plus low-dose aspirin than aspirin only (8/12 vs 3/22, respectively; p = 0.003), and prednisone exposure appeared to be an independent risk factor for preterm birth. CONCLUSIONS: The use of prednisone therapy in conjunction with low-dose aspirin does not appear to improve outcome and may provoke obstetric complications in antiphospholipid antibody-positive patients.
