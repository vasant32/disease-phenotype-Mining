The prevalence of preclinical cardiovascular disease was determined in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and control subjects matched for traditional risk factors. Compared with control subjects, patients with SLE had a higher prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis (41% vs 9%, p < 0.005) and left ventricular hypertrophy (32% vs 5%, p < 0.005), supporting the possibility that chronic inflammation predisposes to premature cardiovascular disease in SLE.
