A previously healthy 16-year-old girl complaining of fever, hemosputum, chest pain and dyspnea was hospitalized. On admission, physical examination revealed mental confusion, holosystolic heart murmur, and swelling of the left foot. Laboratory investigations showed anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, activation of inflammatory reactions, prolongation of PT and APTT, and hypoxia. Antinuclear antibody test was negative. There were no other findings suggestive of collagen diseases such as SLE. Chest X-ray showed consolidation in the left lower lung field and pleural effusion. Echocardiography disclosed a mass lesion in the left atrium in contact with the mitral valve, and mitral regurgitation. No findings indicative of an infectious etiology were present. The patient rapidly improved with high dose corticosteroid and anticoagulant therapy. A venogram of the lower extremity disclosed deep venous thrombosis. A lung ventilation-perfusion scan revealed multiple pulmonary thromboemboli. Elevation of anticardiolipin antibody was noted. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of primary antiphospholipid syndrome was made. Further administration of steroid and anticoagulant resulted in decrease of the titer of anticardiolipin antibody. This is the second report of primary antiphospholipid syndrome in Japan. The clinical significance of this disease is also discussed.
