PURPOSE: to determine the prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with occlusive retinal vascular events, exempt from conventional risk factors of retinal thrombosis. METHODS: eleven patients with retinal vascular occlusion, free of main accepted risk factors for retinal thrombosis, were retrospectively screened for antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin and anti-beta2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies) by an Elisa method. Prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies were compared with those in a homogenous control group of 100 patients. RESULTS: the prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the study group was 27% (three of 11). Comparison with control group prevalence (3%) showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0,001). One patient in the study disclosed positivity for IgG anticardiolipine antibodies, one for IgM anticardiolipine antibodies and one for anti-beta2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies. CONCLUSION: our results lead us to recommend a systematic search for specific antiphospholipid antibodies in such young patients which could have an importance for the diagnosis of primary antiphospholipid syndrome.
