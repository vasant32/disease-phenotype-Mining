We report the clinical case of an 8 years female with systemic lupus erythematosous who developed transverse myelitis secondary to antiphospholipid syndrome. She had an excellent response to the treatment with Prednisone and Cyclophosphamide. As long as we know this is the first report of transverse myelitis as clinical manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome in childhood.
