Primary Sj√∂gren's syndrome (pSS) is a connective tissue disease with symptoms and serological findings often overlapping with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (1). Thromboembolic events are common in SLE but not in pSS (2)(3). However, case reports have described pSS patients who developed fulminant multiorgan disease due to thrombotic diathesis 4, and we have presented a case with acute catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) in a pSS patient (5). In this study we wanted to examine the incidence of thromboembolic episodes and relate these to the presence of autoantibodies and coagulation abnormalities in 90 pSS patients during a 4.6-year follow-up.
