Lupus erythematosus panniculitis is a rare disease characterized by deep subcutaneous nodules, most commonly localized on the upper limbs and face. Unique clinical presentations, such as linear configuration or 'overlap' forms between lupus erythematosus panniculitis and localized scleroderma have been reported. We present here the clinical characteristics, course and laboratory findings of 2 patients having linear lupus erythematosus panniculitis with localized scleroderma-like changes. The 2 patients (of the 14 patients with lupus erythematosus panniculitis seen by us since 1990) were females with a young age at the onset of disease (median, 25 years). In 1 case, evolution into systemic lupus erythematosus with severe renal involvement occurred whereas the other patient, who had a spontaneous abortion and exhibited anticardiolipin antibodies, should be followed and screened for the emergence of antiphospholipid syndrome. Thus, the clinical behavior of this variant seems to be more aggressive, as compared with the usual course of lupus erythematosus panniculitis, which is considered to be a benign disease, although some reports have suggested that its prognosis is not always favorable. The linear distribution could be the clinical hallmark of such a unique, 'sclerodermic' subset of lupus erythematosus panniculitis.
