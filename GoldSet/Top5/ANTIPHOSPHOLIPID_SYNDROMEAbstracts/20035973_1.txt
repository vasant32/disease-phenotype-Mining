 INTRODUCTION: Low-molecular-weight heparin is used clinically for the prevention of pregnancy complications associated with prothrombotic disorders, particularly anti-phospholipid syndrome. Nevertheless, recent studies have suggested that heparin may exert direct effects on the placental trophoblast, independently of its anticoagulant activity. In addition, heparin prevents complement activation in vivo and protects mice from pregnancy complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inhibition of the classical complement activation pathway by heparin was analyzed by means of in vitro assays and in pregnant women receiving prophylaxis with therapeutic doses (40 mg/day) of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin by haemolysis of antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes (CH(50) assay). RESULTS: The specific interaction between low-molecular-weight heparin and the C1q subunit of the C1 complex of the complement cascade allowed the isolation of a small subpopulation of heparin ( 8.03+/-1.20 microg %), with an anti-activated factor X activity more than four times greater than the starting material. This subpopulation could be responsible for the in vitro inhibition of the classical complement activation pathway evaluated by the total haemolysis of antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes. About 60 microg/ml of low molecular weight heparin was needed to achieve 50% of haemolysis. The detection of the classical complement pathway inhibition in pregnant women treated with heparin required a first activation with aggregated human IgG. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the interaction between low-molecular-weight heparin and C1q could be relevant not only in the complement-dependent, but also in the complement-independent inflammation mechanisms responsible for the prevention of pregnancy loss.
