This study was performed to evaluate whether specific patterns of cerebral lesions can be identified in different rheumatic disease entities. In 132 patients with different connective tissue diseases and vasculitides (systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], systemic sclerosis [SSc], mixed connective tissue disease [MCTD], Wegener's granulomatosis [WG], immunocomplex vasculitides, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [APS]), cerebral magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed. Patients were examined clinically, and laboratory parameters including autoantibodies were determined. Distinct distibution patterns could be identified; in WG, most lesions were seen in the cortex, the periventricular region, basal ganglia, and pons. In both SSc and MCTD, highest numbers of lesions could be detected in the corticomedullary junction. In APS, basal ganglia and periventricular white matter were involved predominantly. Generally, the maximum score of cerebral lesions correlated significantly with patients' age. Pathological values for antinuclear antibodies and increased levels of antiphospholipid antibodies were significantly correlated with the presence of cerebral lesions. WG patients and patients with other vasculitides most frequently showed neurological abnormalities. This study in patients with different rheumatic diseases showed distinct distribution patterns of cerebral lesions, which might help to differentiate between them.
