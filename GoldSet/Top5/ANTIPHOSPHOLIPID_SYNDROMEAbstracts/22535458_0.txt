We report the case of a 28-year old woman with extensive red-black colored lesions of the skin on the left thigh, which appeared without trauma. The disease arrived during longterm coumarin therapy because of a deep vein thrombosis and an antiphospholipid syndrome. After consideration of the differential diagnoses and due to the typical clinical picture we made the diagnosis of coumarin necrosis. We review the clinical and therapeutic features for this rare complication.
