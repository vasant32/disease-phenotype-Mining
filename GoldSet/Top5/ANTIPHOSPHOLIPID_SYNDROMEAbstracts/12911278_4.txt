Monocytes, platelets, endothelial cells and oxidized LDL could be very important in development of vascular complication in thrombotic diseases. We measured and compared the levels of plasma monocyte-derived microparticles (MDMPs), platelet-derived microparticles (PDMPs), and anti-oxidized LDL antibody, to develop a better understanding of their potential contribution to vascular complications in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). The concentration of MDMP in APS patients was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than that in normal subjects and SLE patients. When levels of PDMPs and plt-P-selectin were compared between the control and APS patients, levels of PDMPs and plt-P-selectin were significantly higher (p < 0.01 for each) in APS patients than in controls. In addition, these levels of platelet activation markers correlated with MDMP in APS patients. Twenty one of the 37 APS patients (56.8%) had elevated levels of anti-oxLDL antibody. In addition, a significant increase in MDMP was observed in anti-oxLDL antibody-positive APS patients (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that elevated MDMPs may be a sign of vascular complication in APS patients, particularly those who are detected anti-oxLDL antibodies.
