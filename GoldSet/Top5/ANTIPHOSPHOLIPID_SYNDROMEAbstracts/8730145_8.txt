Pulmonary hypertension may occur in the antiphospholipid syndrome as a result of recurrent pulmonary embolism or microthrombosis of pulmonary vessels. We describe 3 cases of primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and cor pulmonale that fulfilled the criteria for chronic major vessel thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy was performed in all 3 patients and it was successful in 2. One patient died in the immediate postoperative period from hemorrhagic pulmonary edema. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension should be added to the list of pulmonary vascular complications of primary APS. Despite its risk, pulmonary thromboendarterectomy represents a treatment option for this otherwise lethal condition.
