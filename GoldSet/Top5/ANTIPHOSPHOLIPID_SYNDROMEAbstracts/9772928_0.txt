The authors report a case of echocardiographically confirmed cardiac tamponade, which required emergency pericardial aspiration, and a transient ischaemic attack revealing an underlying primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in a 29-year-old patient. The test for antiphospholipid antibodies was positive on 2 occasions (IgG > 91.41 micrograms/l). The diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus was eliminated. A favourable course was observed after 3 months of corticosteroids and platelet antiaggregants. Any case of cardiac tamponade or transient ischaemic attack with an unexplained aetiology in a young patient must suggest the diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
