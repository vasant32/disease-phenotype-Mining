The combined presence of anti-phospholipid Ab (aPL), thrombosis, and/or fetal loss is recognized as the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). aPL include anti-cardiolipin Ab (aCL) and/or lupus anticoagulants (LAC, detected as Ig that prolong certain in vitro phospholipid (PL)-restricted blood clotting tests); both aCL and LAC are the diagnostic Ab for APS. Studies show that aPL represent a heterogeneous group of Ab, which recognize various PL, PL-binding plasma proteins, and/or PL-protein complexes. Recently, we found that five of seven patient-derived IgG monoclonal aCL react with thrombin, activated protein C, and plasmin. All three proteins are trypsin-like serine proteases (SP), and are highly homologous in their catalytic domains. Importantly, among these SP autoantigens, the reactive aCL bind to plasmin with the highest affinity, suggesting that plasmin may serve as a major driving autoantigen for some aCL in approximately 30% of APS patients who are positive for IgG anti-plasmin Ab. To test this hypothesis, we immunized BALB/c mice with human plasmin and analyzed immune sera for aCL activity and reactivity with relevant SP. We found that some immune sera displayed aCL activity and/or bound to test SP. Subsequently, eight mAb were obtained and studied. The results revealed that one mAb displayed the aCL and the LAC activities and induced fetal loss when injected into pregnant mice. Immunohistological analyses of placentas revealed extensive deposits of activated C3 components. Combined, these data demonstrate that plasmin may serve as a driving Ag for some pathogenic aPL.
