Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is now recognized as one of the most important causes of hypercoagulability. The most common site for venous thrombosis in APS is deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities. Other sites of venous thrombosis include retinal veins, renal veins, and hepatic veins. The authors report a case of splenic vein thrombosis disclosing antiphospholipid syndrome in which also the cytolytic effect of aPL may play a role of "cofactor" in the genesis of thrombosis through the release of thromboplastin from the lysis of red cells, granulocytes and platelets, making them vulnerable to clearance by splenic macrophages. Important considerations are stressed about differential diagnosis, etiopathogenetic factors, therapy and follow-up of the patient.
