Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are known to be pathogenic in experimental models and are predictive of thrombosis and miscarriages in patients, so it is important to correctly evaluate their presence for identifying patients at risk. Despite many years of work, the standardization of aPL ELISA remains an open problem, so evaluation of newly introduced commercial preparations is mandatory. A total of 80 sera were collected (10 primary antiphospholipid syndromes (APSs), 10 APSs associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, 20 infectious diseases, 20 rheumatoid arthritis and 20 normal blood donors) and tested for IgG/IgM anti-cardiolipin and anti-beta2GPI antibodies on commercial ELISA kits (ETI) by DiaSorin and on home-made ELISA. Both methods displayed good sensitivity and specificity for APS and were found to be concordant, especially in determining antibodies of IgG class.
