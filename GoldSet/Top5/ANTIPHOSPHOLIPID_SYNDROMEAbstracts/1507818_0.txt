The paper described the appearance of lipoid anticoagulant (LA) in the presence of hepatitis B virus in the blood of hemophilia A patient. Profuse and long-term bleeding after the extraction of the tooth that failed to be treated with big doses of cryoprecipitation was noted. Intense replacement therapy resulted in the appearance of factor VIII inhibitor in a titre of 4.5 units per ml in the patient's blood. Big-dose prednisolone therapy helped an immediate arrest of the bleeding and a rapid decrease in LA titration. The levels of factor VIII inhibitor preserved in the same values. The study exhibited the ability of LA to impede the arrest of the bleeding and the response to the replacement treatment in hemophilic patients.
