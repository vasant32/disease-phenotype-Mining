Chronic pulmonary embolism may occur in the antiphospholipid syndrome. Antiphospholipid antibodies including the lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin should therefore be searched for systematically in these patients. Blood clotting (lupus anticoagulant) and immunological (anticardiolipin) investigations are complementary; their positivity may be dissociated. If the thrombus is located in the proximal pulmonary artery, surgical thrombectomy is possible. Operative mortality ranges from 12.6% to 20%. The association of oral anticoagulants with low dose aspirin is indicated for the long term treatment of these patients. The role of steroid therapy is discussed. The authors report the case of a patient with antiphospholipid antibodies who successfully underwent surgical removal of a chronic pulmonary embolism.
