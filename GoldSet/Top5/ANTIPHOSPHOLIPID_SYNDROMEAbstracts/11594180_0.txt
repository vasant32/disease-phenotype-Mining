The Antiphospholipid Syndrome coexisting with Lupus has been associated to wide variety of clinical manifestations, mostly linked to focal ischaemia or infarction. Acute multi-organ failure occurring in patients with these autoantibodies is named Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome because the high mortality. On the other hand, the term Retractile Mesenteritis is applied to the circumstance in which, an chronic inflammatory process with thickening and infiltration of the mesenterium occur, due to ischaemic mechanism, among many other multiple causes. We describe one patient with concomitance of Antiphospholipid Syndrome, evidence of abdominal ischaemia and Retractile Mesenteritis. The patient developed Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome, probably due to infectious process and, antithrombotic therapy suppression because upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and dead.
