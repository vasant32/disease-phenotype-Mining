Defective reaction toward fetal alloantigens could result in both recurrent spontaneous abortions (RSAs) and recurrent early pregnancy failures (REPFs), the latter existing in couples with unexplained infertility and multiple failures of implantation after in vitro fertilization embryo transfer. Immunological mechanisms leading to RSA and REPF seem to be different, although both syndromes probably have a genetic background that has not been identified so far. Despite the fact that antiphospholipid syndrome is a well-established cause of repeated pregnancy loss, the role of different autoantibodies existing in RSA and REPF patients needs to be elucidated. Immunotherapy is believed to correct the detrimental immune reactions; however, its real effectiveness and safety for the treatment of distinct forms of pregnancy loss need to be reconsidered.
