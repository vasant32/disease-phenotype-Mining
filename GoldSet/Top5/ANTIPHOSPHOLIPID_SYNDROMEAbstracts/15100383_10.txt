beta(2)-Glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI) is a principal target antigen for antiphospholipid antibodies associated with recurrent pregnancy loss and fetal growth restriction in women. The significance of disrupted beta(2)GPI activity in contributing to pregnancy pathology in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is not clear. In this study the physiological requirement for functional beta(2)GPI in pregnancy was investigated by evaluating reproductive outcomes in beta(2)GPI null mutant (beta(2)GPI-/-) mice. beta(2)GPI-/- mice were fertile and carried viable fetuses to term. However, there was an 18% reduction in the number of viable implantation sites in beta(2)GPI-/- mice and reduced fetal weight and fetal:placental weight ratio in late gestation, suggesting compromised placental function. Placental architecture was altered in beta(2)GPI-/- implantation sites with a 24% increase in the junctional zone: labyrinthine ratio, but placentae showed no evidence of increased thrombosis in the absence of beta(2)GPI. The effect of beta(2)GPI genotype on pregnancy success after passive transfer of human and mouse antibodies reactive with beta(2)GPI was also explored. Two of five anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies induced pregnancy loss in beta(2)GPI+/+ mice but beta(2)GPI-/- mice were refractory to antibody-induced pregnancy failure. We conclude that functional beta(2)GPI is not essential for successful pregnancy in mice, but optimal placental development and fetal growth require this molecule. Together these data are consistent with pathogenic mechanisms in antiphospholipid syndrome involving both neutralization of beta(2)GPI function and beta(2)GPI-immunoglobulin complex formation.
