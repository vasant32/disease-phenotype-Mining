Circulating antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are associated with central nervous system dysfunction in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) patients and in a mouse model of APS. We propose a logical pathway of how experimental APS (eAPS) causes brain dysfunction: binding of the antibodies to the brain endothelium evoking microthrombosis, endothelial dysfunction, and IgG leakage through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), then secondary inflammatory cell spread around blood vessels and production of cytokines by these inflammatory cells leading to further disruption of the BBB. The diffuse brain endothelial dysfunction would result in extravasation of serum proteins including APS IgG and activated thrombin, which may induce the behavioral changes observed in the APS mice. We have collected data from the mouse eAPS model which supports this hypothesis. Elucidating the mechanism of the pathogenicity of aPL in vitro and in vivo will serve as a much needed basis for developing new therapeutic modalities in this important disorder.
