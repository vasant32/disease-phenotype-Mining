Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was used during the replacement of the aortic and mitral valves in a 43-year-old female patient. The case was complicated by the presence of a rare hypercoagulable condition called anticardiolipin (antiphospholipid) antibody syndrome. The course of bypass was uneventful and the patient was released from the intensive care unit on the first postoperative day. CPB in the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies is an unusual situation that requires diligent hematological monitoring. Since 1989 there have been only 14 reported cases of these antibodies and cardiopulmonary bypass. Eight of these have involved valve replacements.
