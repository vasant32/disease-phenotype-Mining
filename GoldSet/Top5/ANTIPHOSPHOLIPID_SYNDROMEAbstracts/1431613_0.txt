We report two cases of renal vein thrombosis, unusual because of acute expression, right renal vein localization, absence of the usual renal or perirenal causes, surgical management and a never before reported etiology. In one case the thrombosis was secondary to primary antiphospholipid syndrome, in the other it was secondary to heparin associated thrombocythemia. In this case surgical management was performed during prostacyclin infusion.
