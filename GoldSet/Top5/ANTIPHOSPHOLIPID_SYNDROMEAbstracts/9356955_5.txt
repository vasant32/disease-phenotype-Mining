We report here a case of primary antiphospholipid syndrome with all three clinical features with acute myocardial infarction. Echocardiography showed large vegetations at both mitral valve leaflets. Laboratory evaluation showed presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. High-intensity anticoagulation was begun, and repeat echocardiographic study in 4 months showed disappearance of the mitral valve vegetations.
