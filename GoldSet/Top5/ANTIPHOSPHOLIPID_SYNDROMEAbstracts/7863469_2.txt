Beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta 2-GPI) binds negatively charged substances and inhibits intrinsic blood coagulation in the presence of ellagic acid-phospholipid suspension. Beta 2-GPI is thought to be an important protein in the reaction between negatively charged phospholipids and anti-phospholipid antibodies which appear in patients with lupus anticoagulant/antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. We prepared a monoclonal antibody against beta 2-GPI purified from human plasma and obtained beta 2-GPI-depleted plasma using a monoclonal antibody-coupled column. Either partial thromboplastin time or the activation of prekallikrein induced by diluted ellagic acid-phospholipid suspension in beta 2-GPI-depleted plasma was not different from that in control plasma. Beta 2-GPI inhibited the intrinsic blood coagulation only when added to control or beta 2-GPI-depleted plasma in excess (more than physiological concentrations). The intrinsic fibrinolysis in beta 2-GPI-depleted plasma induced by dextran sulfate was not impaired and, again, beta 2-GPI inhibited the intrinsic fibrinolysis only when added to control or beta 2-GPI-depleted plasma in excess. These results indicate that both in vitro Actin-induced intrinsic coagulation and dextran sulfate-induced fibrinolytic activities are significantly inhibited by more than physiological concentrations of beta 2-GPI.
