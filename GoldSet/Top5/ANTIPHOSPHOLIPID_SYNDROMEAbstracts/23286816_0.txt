Anetoderma is an elastolytic disorder that is associated with a number of infectious and autoimmune disorders. We present a case of a patient with generalized anetoderma, who was later found to have positive antinuclear antibodies and antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs). Numerous other cases have been reported in literature and some authors have suggested that anetoderma is a highly specific sign of APAs, with or without other manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome [14]. Thus, work up for connective-tissue disorders should be considered in any patients who present with this skin finding.
