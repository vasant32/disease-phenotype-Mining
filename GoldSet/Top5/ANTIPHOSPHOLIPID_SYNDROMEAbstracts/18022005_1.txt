INTRODUCTION: Among cardiac transplantation (OHT) of coronary arterial disease, the pathogenesis can be associated with autoimmunologic effects due to oxidative lipoprotein modification and their change in antigenicity. These factors may lead to lipoprotein vascular changes observed in antiphospholipid syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus. The aim of the presented study was to evaluate anticardiolipin autoantibodies (ACA) and anti-ox-LDL (antibodies against oxidized LDL) levels in the plasma immunoglobulin IgG class. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 90 OHT patients (79 men/11 women, age 44 +/- 13); 35 individuals were chosen as a control group. Blood samples were taken twice, in years 2002 and 2004. The investigated group was divided into 2 smaller groups: OHT patients in 2002 and OHT patients before 2002. RESULTS: OHT patients showed significantly higher ACA concentrations compared with the control group (3.53 vs 1.10 GPL U/mL), whereas anti-ox-LDL levels did not differ considerably (494 vs 385 mU/mL). During long-term observation the significant increase in ACA concentration was observed in both patients groups. Significant differences between the 2 OHT patient groups regarding anti-ox-LDL concentration were demonstrated among samples taken in 2002. CONCLUSIONS: The results may indicate the possible role of autoimmunological processes in OHT development. It is necessary to focus further research on the possibilities of developing secondary antiphospholipid syndrome.
