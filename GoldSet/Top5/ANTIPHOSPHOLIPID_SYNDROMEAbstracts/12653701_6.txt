We report a 69-year-old Caucasian female with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who subsequently developed leg ulcers as a manifestation of the antiphospholipid syndrome. Investigations revealed a mixed cryoglobulinaemia with monoclonal IgM-kappa and antiphospholipid activity with anticardiolipin antibodies, antimitochondrial type M5 antibodies and lupus anticoagulant. Significantly increased concentration of anticardiolipin antibodies was detected in the cryoprecipitate. Our case illustrates a connection between cryoglobulinaemia and lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disorders. Both cryoglobulins and anticardiolipin antibodies could participate in the vascular damage. Cutaneous manifestations in the presence of these disorders associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have not been described previously.
