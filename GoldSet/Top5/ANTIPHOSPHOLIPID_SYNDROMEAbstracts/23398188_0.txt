 PROBLEM: To study the histopathology and expression of apoptosis in placenta of pregnancy-complicated antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)-positive mouse models. METHOD OF STUDY: ICR mice were immunized with IgG isotype of human anticardiolipin (aCL) and/or lupus anticoagulant (LA). The pathological and apoptotic expression was studied in the placenta of positive APS mice and compared with respective control samples. RESULTS: Mice with passive immunization of human aCL and/or LA produced an increase in fetal resorption along with markedly induced thrombosis in the placenta associated with increased placental apoptosis. In addition, fewer mitotic cells, less trophoblast giant cell invasion, and more shrunken cells in the deciduas were seen. CONCLUSION: Our study showed the pathogenic role of aCL and LA in pregnancy complications.
