 BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with or without evidence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPA) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is associated with a high rate of spontaneous abortions. The placenta is thought to be the site of pathological damage in many of these abortions. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of sera obtained from women with SLE with or without treatment on human placental explants in culture. METHODS: We cultured 5.5- to 7.5-week-old human placental explants in a culture medium containing F-12 DMEM and 10% FCS or in 90% human serum obtained from nonpregnant women with SLE prior to or after treatment. Culture was carried out for 96 hr. At the end of the culture period, we studied the secretion of the placental hormones estrogen (E2), progesterone (PGN), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). In addition, we studied the proliferation rate (using PCNA staining) and the rate of apoptosis (using ApoTag) of the trophoblastic cells. RESULTS: Placentae grew better in normal human serum than in a chemically defined medium of F-12 DMEM and 10% FCS. Enhanced growth and higher secretion rates for hCG and estradiol (E2) were manifested in placentae cultured in control sera with no change in PGN secretion. Secretion rates of hCG and PGN (but not of E2 in the treated group) by placental explants were similar to that of controls. However, the serum levels prior to culture were not measured. Further, explants in serum from untreated women with SLE produced a significant decrease in the proliferation rate of the trophoblastic cells and an increase of apoptosis. Treatment significantly reduced the apoptotic rate and increased cell proliferation, but the cell proliferation rate was still lower than that noted in controls. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that sera from women with SLE may directly damage the developing placenta reducing proliferation and enhancing apoptosis. Successful treatment of the women reduces that damage.
