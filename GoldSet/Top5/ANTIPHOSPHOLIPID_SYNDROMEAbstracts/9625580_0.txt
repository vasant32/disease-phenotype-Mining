We experienced two rare cases of pernicious anemia that presented in the course of mycosis fungoides in elderly males. Pernicious anemia has recently been reported to be caused by autoimmune gastritis that produces autoantibodies to gastric parietal cells and intrinsic factor. Immunological abnormalities in mycosis fungoides are reported to induce autoimmune diseases (i.e., autoimmune hemolytic anemia, anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome, arthritis, myasthenia gravis, necrotizing vasculitis, and vitiligo); the pernicious anemia in our two patients may have been closely related to the mycosis fungoides.
