We describe a case of 18-year-old woman followed for 3 years for systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) complicated of a nephrectomy. Having like only factor of cardiovascular risk a balanced arterial hypertension. The patient was hospitalized because of choreo-athetosic's movement. We discovered fortuitously during this hospitalization an inferior myocardial necrosis as well as a mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography was normal and the ventriculography showed an akinesy in the inferior territory. Biology made it possible to pose the diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) on (SLE). We suppose that surgery started myocardial necrosis and underline through this case interest of early identification and appropriate treatment of APS as well as a narrow monitoring particularly in young patients candidates to surgery.
