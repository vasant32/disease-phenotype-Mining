OBJECTIVE: There are few reports describing histopathologic changes associated with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. We describe a patient with multi-infarct dementia and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, in whom a brain biopsy was performed. METHODS: Biopsy material from the left frontal cortex, including meninges, cortex, and underlying subcortical white matter, was investigated. Microscopic examination and special staining were performed. RESULTS: Microscopic examination showed lumenal occlusion by thrombi, and marked endothelial hyperplasia of small meningeal and cortical arterioles. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of this cerebral vasculopathy is noninflammatory and is associated with reactive endothelial hyperplasia and thrombosis of small arterioles.
