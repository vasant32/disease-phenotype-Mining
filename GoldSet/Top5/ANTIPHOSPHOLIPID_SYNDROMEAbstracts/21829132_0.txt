Antiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder characterized by arterial or venous thrombosis, high plasma levels of antiphospholipid antibodies, recurrent fetal loss (in women) and thrombocytopenia. The authors present a case of a 28-year-old man with no significant medical history who presented with ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI) and underwent percutaneous intervention to left anterior descending artery. He was also found to have intracardiac thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated activated partial thromboplastin time and persistently elevated anticardiolipin and beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies. The authors performed a literature search regarding the frequency of MI and intracardiac thrombosis as the primary presentation of antiphospholipid syndrome and the relationship of antiphospholipid antibodies with MI.
