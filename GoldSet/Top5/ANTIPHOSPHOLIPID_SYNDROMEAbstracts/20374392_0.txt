Chronic periaortitis (CP) is a rare disease, the common denominator of which is a retroperitoneal periaortic fibroinflammatory tissue that frequently obstructs neighboring structures. CP has already been reported in association with various autoimmune disorders, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosus and Sj√∂gren's syndrome. The association with autoimmune disorders suggests that CP is a manifestation of a systemic autoimmune process. We describe the first case of antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient with CP.
