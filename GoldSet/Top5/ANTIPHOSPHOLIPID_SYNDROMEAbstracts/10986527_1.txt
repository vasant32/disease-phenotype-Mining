Lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin are antiphospholipid antibodies. The presence of either or both antiphospholipid antibodies may result in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which is typified by recurrent venous or arterial thrombosis, recurrent fetal loss, and thrombocytopenia. Many features of this syndrome are not well understood, including its prevalence, how and why antiphospholipid autoantibodies develop, and their definitive role in disease states. In clinical practice, nurses care for patients and families with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome who require treatment, education, and support.
