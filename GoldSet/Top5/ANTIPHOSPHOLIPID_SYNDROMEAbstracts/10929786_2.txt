The antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome is associated with an increased incidence of arterial and venous thrombosis. Although renal infarction has been observed in these patients, stenotic lesions of the renal artery associated with the antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome have not been reported. A 47-year-old male with a history of hypertension for 7 years developed blurred vision secondary to thrombotic occlusion of the central retinal artery. Laboratory and radiologic examinations revealed renal dysfunction, a positive anticardiolipin antibody, and narrowing of the right renal artery. Successful percutaneous transluminal renal artery angioplasty resulted in normalization of the blood pressure and recovery of renal function.
