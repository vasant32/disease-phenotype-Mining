We aimed to evaluate avidity of anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I antibodies (anti-beta(2)-GPIs) in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) at the time of acute thrombotic events or pregnancy loss as compared with clinical event-free periods. To do so, 69 sera samples from 16 patients (6 with primary APS and 10 with APS secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus ) were selected on the basis of anti-beta(2)-GPI positivity. Avidity of IgG anti-beta(2)-GPIs was determined by chaotropic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using increased NaCl concentration during antibody binding. High, heterogeneous, and low-avidity anti-beta(2)-GPIs were measured in APS patients, with no clear pattern regarding the time of thrombotic events or pregnancy failure. In general, anti-beta(2)-GPI avidity did not change substantially during disease course. We concluded that avidity of anti-beta(2)-GPIs appears to be a rather stable parameter in an individual APS patient. Considering the previously shown association of high-avidity anti-beta(2)-GPIs with venous thrombosis, avidity of anti-beta(2)-GPIs may be a better predictor of predisposition to thrombosis and unsuccessful pregnancy than levels of antiphospholipid antibodies, which may fluctuate over time owing to several factors.
