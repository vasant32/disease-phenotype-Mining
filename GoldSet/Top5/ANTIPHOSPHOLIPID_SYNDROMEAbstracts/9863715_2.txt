The binding of antiphospholipid antibodies to circulating platelets and the potential association with thrombocytopenia and platelet activation was investigated in 25 patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Fourteen patients had a platelet count above 150 x 10(9)/l, and 11 patients had mild to moderate thrombocytopenia of 50-150 x 10(9)/l. The presence of platelet autoantibodies was investigated by immunofluorescent binding. No correlation between the presence of autoantibodies on platelets and thrombocytopenia was found. The binding of antibodies in patients' serum and platelet eluates was investigated by performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with phospholipids as antigens. In seven patients antibodies to negatively charged phospholipids were present in platelet eluates. Platelet activation was measured by flow cytometry using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled monoclonal antibody to P-selectin (CD62). The binding of anti-P-selectin to patients' platelet surface P-selectin was not increased, compared with the binding to platelets obtained from normal donors. Platelet serotonin concentration in APS patients was significantly lower than that found in the platelets of normal controls. More studies are necessary to determine the exact role of antiphospholipid antibodies in the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia, and to elucidate the cause of low serotonin levels in platelets of APS patients.
