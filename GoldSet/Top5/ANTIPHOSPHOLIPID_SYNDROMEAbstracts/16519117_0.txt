We report an 80-year-old woman who had rheumatoid arthritis and antiphospholipid syndrome. She was treated for rheumatoid arthritis since her thirties. At 76 years of age, she was diagnosed antiphospholipid syndrome serologically. She felt It. limb weakness and dysarthria and was admitted to the hospital on July 18, 2003. The brain MRI showed T2 hyperintensity signal on the rt. pre-central lobe. She was treated by the argatroban, edaravone, glycerol, and aspirin. However, she became bedridden and fed by NG-tube because her symptoms progressed in spite of the therapy. Progression of stroke stopped by adding heparin at last. After that, she repeated pneumonia. She was found dead on the bed August 2, 2003. The patient was discussed in a CPC. The chief discussant arrived at a conclusion that the cause of infarction was angitis due to rheumatoid arthritis. Other possibilities were multiple thrombus due to antiphospholipid syndrome, amyloid angiopathy, and atherosclerotic infarction. Post-mortem study revealed sputum obstruction in her bronchus, string deposition in her organs. The brain showed infarction on the rt. pre-central lobe. There were multiple thrombus in the leptomeningeal artery, but few atherosclerotic changes of the small arteries. Amyloid didn't deposit in the brain artery and the parenchyma. Pathologist concluded that her infarction was induced with multiple thrombus due to antiphospholipid syndrome.
