It is well known that there may be an increased tendency for thrombosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study presents a case with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome with ulcerative colitis diagnosed during pregnancy. A 30-year-old female patient, in her 6th week of pregnancy, applied to our clinic with complaints of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. She had a history of three abortions. She had been given aspirin and heparin treatment due to high levels of anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) in previous examinations that led to the diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. As the left colonoscopic examination of the patient showed ulcerative colitis, aspirin treatment was replaced with mesalazine (750 mg/day, in 3 equal doses). There was a significant relief in complaints of the patient. Medical treatment was interrupted three days before delivery. The patient delivered a baby, at full-term, of 3.6 kg by cesarean section. No adverse effects were observed in the mother or the baby due to the medical treatment. After delivery, mesalazine treatment was restarted. This case is interesting due to the co-diagnosis of IBD in a pregnant woman with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Successful and uncomplicated treatment of the patient with mesalazine should also be noted.
