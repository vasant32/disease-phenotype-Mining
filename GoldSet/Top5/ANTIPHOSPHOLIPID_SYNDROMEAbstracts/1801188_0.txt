The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLAS) is a unique clinical syndrome with features of recurrent thrombosis, recurrent fetal loss, and thrombocytopenia. It is associated with a false positive test for syphilis, a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), a positive test for lupus anticoagulant (LA), and anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLA). A case report illustrating some of the clinical and laboratory abnormalities and therapeutic dilemmas is presented. The literature is then reviewed.
