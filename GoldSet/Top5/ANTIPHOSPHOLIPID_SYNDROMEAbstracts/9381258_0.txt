BACKGROUND: It is a very well-known fact the relationship between pregnancy with history of fetal losses and positive aCL, and many treatments have been tried in order to prevent it. We present a study about the treatment of these pregnant women with ASA at low doses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have followed-up a group of 28 women with previous abortions and positive aCL. They were treated with ASA (50 mg/day) since beginning until end of pregnancy. We measured aCL levels monthly. RESULTS: 24 cases of pregnancy (86%) were successfully, 3 cases were fetal losses and 1 case was a fetal malformation. IgG aCL were positive in 16 patients before treatment, and IgM aCL in 11 cases. One patient had both of them. 18 patients became negative after pregnancy. We have not found any relationship between the level of aCL and fetal losses. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, ASA at low doses (50 mg/day) is a safe and effective treatment in achieving successful pregnancies, and reducing aCL levels in patients with history of fetal losses.
