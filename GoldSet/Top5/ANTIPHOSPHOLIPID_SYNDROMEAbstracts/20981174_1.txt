With the exception of the catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), the management of patients with APS has been largely supportive aiming at avoiding a recurrent thrombotic event; it is noteworthy that data concerning therapy targeting the triggering factor (the antiphopsholipid antibodies) are scarce. We report a case of APS manifested as recurrent fetal losses, ischemic stroke and renal dysfunction with concomitant nephrotic syndrome successfully treated with the combination of plasmapheresis and anti-CD20 antibody.
