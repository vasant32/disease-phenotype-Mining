The antiphospholipid or Hughes syndrome is the association between antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), venous and arterial thromboses and pregnancy morbidity. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) commonly coexists with autoimmune diseases usually systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), when it is known as secondary APS. When present in isolation it is known as primary APS (PAPS). Although the kidney may be affected in APS, its involvement is perhaps not as well described as that of other organs. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) affecting the kidney has been reported as a manifestation in both primary and secondary APS. This report describes hypertension related to underlying renal TMA as a presenting symptom of APS.
