We report a case of a 13-year-old female presenting with deep venous thrombosis in her left lower limb. Investigations led by her symptoms and history revealed persistently positive lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies, indicating the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome. Double-stranded DNA antibodies were detected positive pointing to the coexistence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Antiphospholipid syndrome-related vascular occlusive events are causing high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is mandatory for the recognition of children being at risk for primary or recurrent thrombotic complications.
