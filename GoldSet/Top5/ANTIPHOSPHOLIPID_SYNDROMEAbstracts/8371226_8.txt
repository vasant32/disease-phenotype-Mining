We observed 2 cases of antiphospholipid syndrome complicated with hemiparesis appearing after delivery. During pregnancy, both women were systematically treated with aspirin (100 mg/day) in addition to prednisone in the second case. Cerebral infarction appeared a few hours after delivery and 8 days after discontinuation of aspirin. The close temporal relationship between discontinuation of aspirin and stroke occurring in early postpartum period suggests a causal link. If aspirin must be stopped for obstetrical reasons, we think that efficient anticoagulation should be started even if the presence of the antiphospholipid antibodies has been priorly asymptomatic.
