Intestinal ischemia in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (PAPS) could be due to arterial thrombosis from hypercoagulability. A male patient, 45 years old, was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of acute abdomen and after laparotomy he developed sepsis, right kidney infarction, jejunal ischemia, aortic thrombosis, wide necrosis of both gluteus muscles, left subclavian vein thrombosis. Our therapeutic and diagnostic strategy was delineated after demonstration of antiphospholipid antibodies. The patient was treated with total parenteral nutrition in the presence of 5 enteric fistulas with very high outflow, arterial stent insertion and daily changes of medicated dressings. Outcome was excellent with small residual deficit in walking. Continuous nutritional status monitoring and very high nitrogen supply allowed excellent healing of huge wounds and closure of enteral fistulas.
