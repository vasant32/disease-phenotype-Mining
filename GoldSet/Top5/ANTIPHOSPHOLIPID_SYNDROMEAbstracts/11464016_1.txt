We have treated a 33-year-old Budd-Chiari patient (due to antiphospholipid syndrome) with a history of myocardial infarction by placing a vascular stent in the inferior vena cava and performing a portorenal shunt with three objectives: (1) to perform a shunt operation on a Budd-Chiari patient with good hepatic functional reserve, (2) to avoid a thoracotomy and manipulation of the heart in a patient with a cardiac thrombus and a history of myocardial infarction and (3) to avoid a synthetic graft in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome. Vena cava stenting and portorenal shunt make a useful combination which should be included in the armamentarium of the hepatobiliary surgeon.
