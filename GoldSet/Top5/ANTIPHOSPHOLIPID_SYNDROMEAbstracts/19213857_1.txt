Sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) are chronic conditions of immune dysregulation whose aetiologies remain mysterious. Expression of sarcoidosis and SLE within individuals has been reported in a handful of cases in the last 60 years. In this study, we report two cases of sarcoidosis and SLE occurring together, and each case demonstrated complications associated with the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies. Clinical, serological and pathological findings confirmed the diagnoses in each case and both patients improved with therapy. The association of sarcoidosis, SLE and APS is unique and may present difficult therapeutic options, as well as to shed light on their immunopathogenesis.
