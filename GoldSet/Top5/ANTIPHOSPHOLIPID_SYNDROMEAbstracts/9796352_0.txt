The authors have determined the prevalence of antibodies of cofactor dependent anticardiolipin and beta 2-glycoprotein I and lupus anticoagulant and the frequency of false positive VDRL test in systemic lupus erythematosus. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the presence of these antibodies and symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome. The serum samples were examined by modified ELISA method for detecting of cofactor dependent anticardiolipin. The antibodies to beta 2-glycoprotein I were examined by ELISA. The lupus anticoagulant and VDRL test were performed by routine laboratory method. The authors have found that 19 of 58 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus had cofactor dependent anticardiolipin, 10 patients had antibodies to beta 2-glycoprotein I and 4 patients had positive VDRL test. 5 of 34 plasma samples were lupus anticoagulant positive. 19 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus had 14 neuropsychiatric disorders, 9 cardiovascular diseases, 7 thrombocytopenia, 6 histories of recurrent abortion and fetal loss, 5 livedo reticularis and 3 thromboembolic events in all of them had detected antibodies to cofactor dependent anticardiolipin, while these complications were diagnosed in 39 anticardiolipin negative patients much more rarely. The results of this retrospective study suggest that significant association exists between the presence of cofactor dependent anticardiolipin and symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome in systemic lupus erythematosus.
