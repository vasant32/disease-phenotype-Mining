Examination of 115 women for detection of phospholipid antibodies (PLA), lupus anticoagulant and cardiolipin antibodies has demonstrated that in the absence of PLA all pregnancies terminated in the birth of full-term healthy children, while in their presence there were repeated abortions and (or) intrauterine death of a fetus. Obstetrical pathology in women in the presence of PLA was attended by venous and arterial thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, cerebral vasculitis and vascular affections, which is typical of the picture of the antiphospholipid syndrome. A new approach has been suggested to the treatment of such patients with reduction of the activity of lupus anticoagulant and cardiolipin antibodies owing to which pregnancy can be terminated in the birth of viable children.
