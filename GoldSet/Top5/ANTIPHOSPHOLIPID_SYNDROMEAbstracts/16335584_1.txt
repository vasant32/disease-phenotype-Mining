Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is a rare complication of antiphospholipid syndrome. It is a disseminated severe vascular pathology which presents with multi-organic dysfunction that progresses rapidly. Prognosis ends up being fatal in half of the cases. It may appear during pregnancy, surgery, infection, or after suspension of anticoagulation therapy. We studied two female patients with CAPS who survived after treatment with anticoagulation therapy and intravenous corticosteroids. The evolution of our two patients, after 17 months of follow-up under oral anticoagulant treatment was favourable and they are currently asymptomatic. In these patients the early diagnosis and treatment were essential to enhance their possibilities of survival.
