The "V Meeting of the European Forum on Antiphospholipid Antibodies" was organized in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, on December 2-3, 2005. This biannual meeting becomes a real forum for the interchange of information on current research on the field antiphospholipid antibodies and the antiphospholipid syndrome, as well as a starting point for many new research projects. About 170 physicians and researchers from a great variety of medical specialities (internists, rheumatologists, hematologists, obstetricians, pediatricians, neurologists, cardiologists, immunologists, and biologists, among others) coming from 20 European countries attended the sessions. This report summarizes the main studies and new research projects presented during this Forum Meeting.
