 PURPOSE: The occurrence of acute pancreatitis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is known but rare, and is exceptionally the presenting manifestation. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial, and it is difficult to separate what belongs to vasculitis, thrombotic phenomena in the context of an associated antiphospholipid syndrome, or iatrogenic complications. We report on six cases of lupus pancreatitis. METHODS: This is a retrospective monocenter study of 110 patients with SLE. The diagnosis of lupus pancreatitis was established after exclusion of other causes of pancreatitis. RESULTS: Five women and one man (5.4%) with a mean age of 36.3 years presented with lupus pancreatitis. In four patients the pancreatitis was concurrent with the diagnosis of SLE and it occurred later during an exacerbation of the disease in the two remaining patients. In all patients, pancreatic manifestations were associated with other organ involvement. Clinical manifestations were: abdominal pain (n=6), vomiting (n=3), and fever (n=3). Elevated pancreatic enzyme was noted in all cases. All patients were treated by high doses of glucocorticoids. The outcome was favorable in five patients, and one patient died. CONCLUSION: Pancreatitis may be the presenting manifestation of SLE. Its pathogenesis is often multifactorial. The outcome is usually favorable with corticosteroids.
