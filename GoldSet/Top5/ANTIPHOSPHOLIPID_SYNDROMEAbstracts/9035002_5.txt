Catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, reported in a minority of patients with circulating antiphospholipid antibodies, is characterized by widespread vascular occlusions. The term "catastrophic" has been used to describe the severity of symptomatology, sometimes leading to death. We describe a girl aged 11 years, fulfilling diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus, with recurrent episodes of thromboembolic phenomena involving lung and skin, complicated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. Treatment with warfarin ultimately resulted in effective control of the disease.
