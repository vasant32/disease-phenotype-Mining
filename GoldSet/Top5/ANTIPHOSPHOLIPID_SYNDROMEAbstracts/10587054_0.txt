AIM: To determine whether there is an association between pernicious anaemia and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. METHODS: Fifteen patients with pernicious anaemia and 11 patients with iron deficiency anaemia (controls) were evaluated for clinical parameters of thrombosis and/or the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, antinuclear antibodies or lupus anticoagulant. RESULTS: One asymptomatic patient with pernicious anaemia had laboratory features suggestive of the antiphospholipid syndrome. An additional three patients in each group had slightly elevated antiphospholipid antibody concentrations, within one standard deviation of the normal range. CONCLUSION: The association between pernicious anaemia and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is rare and evaluation should be guided by clinical indications.
