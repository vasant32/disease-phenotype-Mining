Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria (PCH) is an autoimmune haemolytic anaemia caused by the Donath-Landsteiner antibody. It is classically described in association with chronic syphilis or after acute viral infections. We describe the first case of PCH presented as a late manifestation of advanced myelofibrosis associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, that promptly responded to high dosage of prednisone.
