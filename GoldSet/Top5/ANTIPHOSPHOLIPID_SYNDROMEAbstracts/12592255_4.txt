 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether primary antiphospholipid syndrome pregnancies are associated with endothelial cell activation in the maternal circulation. STUDY DESIGN: Markers of endothelial cell activation were measured every 4 weeks during pregnancy in the blood of 23 women with primary antiphospholipid syndrome and 19 control subjects. All women with antiphospholipid syndrome received anticoagulant treatment. Plasma concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, tissue plasminogen activator, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, and soluble thrombomodulin were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Concentrations of prothrombin fragments 1+2 and D-dimers were also determined. RESULTS: Three antiphospholipid syndrome pregnancies (13%) were complicated by intrauterine growth restriction and preeclampsia; one antiphospholipid syndrome pregnancy (4%) was complicated by preterm rupture of membranes. Six women with antiphospholipid syndrome (26%) had thrombotic events. Differences in concentrations of endothelial cell activation markers between antiphospholipid syndrome and control pregnancies were not significant. CONCLUSION: Despite poorer pregnancy outcome, there was no evidence of greater endothelial cell activation in antiphospholipid syndrome pregnancies that were treated.
