Stroke is uncommon after orthotopic liver transplantation. We offer the first report, to our knowledge, of two posttransplant patients with stroke associated with elevated anticardiolipin antibodies, and we discuss their management, including the use of immunosuppression and antithrombotic therapy. We suggest that anticoagulation is the treatment of choice for such patients.
