The management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in a 22-year-old female patient with antiphospholipid syndrome is reported. Gabexate mesilate was given by continuous drip infusion at 1.5 g/day. No effect was seen, therefore Dalteparin sodium (DS) was administered by continuous drip infusion at 70 U/kg/day. The DIC score improved gradually during the first 4 days to normalization by 10 days. However, convulsive seizure was developed. Computed tomographic scan of brain demonstrated brain abscess at lt-basal ganglia. Continuous drainage was performed while administered continuous drip infusion of DS. Follow-up CT after operation showed reduction of low density area which means brain abscess. Finding in this case suggest that DS may play a role in the management of DIC accompanying intracranial infection.
