This is a retrospective study based on a population of 80 patients with connective tissue diseases from the University Hospital of Puerto Rico. Among the population, 62 (77.5%) of the patients had Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), whom we were most interested to monitor. The investigation revealed an incidence of 13.8% of anthiophospholipid syndrone within the general population. Among the patients with SLE it was 12.9%, and only 5.5% among the population with other diagnoses. The antibody found with the highest frequency within the systemic lupus erythematosus population was the anticardiolipin IgG (30.6%) and lupus anticoagulant (17.7%). The antibody frequency among patients with other diagnoses was only 5.5% for lupus anticoagulant and 5.5% for anticardiolipin IgM (the only one found). Among SLE's clinical manifestations, the most frequently found were thrombocitopenia and pregnancy complications.
