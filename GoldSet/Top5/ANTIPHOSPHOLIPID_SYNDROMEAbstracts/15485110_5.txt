This prospective multicentric register was initiated by the European Forum of Antiphospholipid Antibodies (APL) in 2003 after approval by local ethic committees. This register allows the investigation of infants after written informed parental consent. It collects mothers' clinical pattern of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), course and outcome of pregnancy, treatment and immunological status. For the babies, clinical and immunological examinations are performed at birth; neurodevelopmental conditions followed up to five years. A re-evaluation of lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin (ACL) or other antibodies will be done if they are positive at birth to follow their kinetics. A descriptive and a case control study of babies with versus without APL at birth will be possible after the inclusion of 300 cases.
