Many investigators have been intrigued by the paradoxical association of a circulating anticoagulant, first called lupus anticoagulant by Feinstein and Rapaport [1], with a tendency to develop thrombosis, as initially described by Walter Bowie [2]. Work in Leuven on this topic started when Luis Carreras, an Argentinian hematologist, joined the laboratory of blood coagulation at this university in 1979. At that time, the head of the laboratory was Marc Verstraete. Luis had a particular interest in antibody-mediated coagulation disorders, and had prepared reviews on thrombosis and thrombocytopenia induced by heparin [3] and on the lupus inhibitor [4]. In Leuven, he joined Jos Vermylen, senior member of the laboratory, and an internist with particular interest in hemostasis, thrombosis and vascular disease. As such, Professor Vermylen was involved in both laboratory research and patient care.
