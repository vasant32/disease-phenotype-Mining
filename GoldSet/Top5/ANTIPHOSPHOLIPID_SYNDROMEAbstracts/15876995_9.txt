Thrombophilia is the term now used to describe predisposition to increased risk of venous and occasionally arterial thromboembolism due to hematological abnormalities. It can be a multifactorial disorder where congenital defects of anticoagulant or procoagulant factors may be combined with acquired hematological abnormalities. It should be considered in patients with a documented unexplained thrombotic episode or a positive family history. The aim of this document is to provide guidelines for investigation and management of patients with thrombophilia in the presence or absence of venous thromboembolism (VTE).
