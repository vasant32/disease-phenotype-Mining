Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with arterial and venous thromboses, recurrent pregnancy loss, and organ infarction. Any vascular region can be affected. We present a 20-year-old woman suffering from secondary antiphospholipid syndrome with a unique combination of multifocal venous thromboses, pulmonary embolism, spontaneous abortion, and splenic infarction. Diversity of clinical symptoms and diagnostic imaging modalities are discussed with emphasis on cross-sectional imaging. The syndrome should be suspected in patients with thromboses and organ infarctions of otherwise undetermined etiology.
