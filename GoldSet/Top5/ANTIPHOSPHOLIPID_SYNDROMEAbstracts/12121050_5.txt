The purpose of this study was to check whether antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) could be an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. Eighty-five subjects were studied: 45 with primitive antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and 40 controls affected by deep vein thrombosis secondary to known causes. The two groups were homogeneous for age, sex, and risk factors for atherosclerosis. All the subjects submitted to echo-color doppler of the carotid arteries, femoral arteries, and abdominal aorta. The cases were then subdivided into three subgroups on the basis of the positivity to the three subpopulations of aPL. Results demonstrate that there is no correlation between aPL and atherosclerosis. The different positivity to aPL does not modify this conclusion.
