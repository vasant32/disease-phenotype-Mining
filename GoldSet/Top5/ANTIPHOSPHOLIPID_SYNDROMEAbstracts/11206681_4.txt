We report an unusual case of renovascular hypertension in a 16-year-old boy with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS), admitted to our clinic for severe drug-resistant hypertension and hypokalemia. Hormonal investigation revealed secondary aldosteronism and positive captopril test for renovascular disease. Aortography confirmed the occlusion of the left renal artery. After nephrectomy, normalization of blood pressure and secondary aldosteronism occurred. Presently the patient remains in good health, receiving warfarin anticoagulant therapy. PAPS is defined by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and recurrent thrombosis. Arterial thrombosis (29%) appears to be less prevalent than venous thrombosis. Thrombotic microangiopathy of the kidney is frequently observed but renal artery occlusion, as seen in our patient, is unusual.
