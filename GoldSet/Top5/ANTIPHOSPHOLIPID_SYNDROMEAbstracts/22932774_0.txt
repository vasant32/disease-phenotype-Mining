Acute myocardial infarction (MI) in young adults is rare. Clinicopathological conditions such as nephrotic syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, spontaneous coronary artery spasms or embolism can be attributed to such events. In this case report, we present a 30-year-old male who had his first MI at the age of 20 years. He received percutaneous intervention as initial treatment. Despite aggressive risk factor management, he continued to have acute coronary events and was later diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). At the same time, he was diagnosed with severe chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and severe tricuspid regurgitation. He underwent pulmonary endartererectomy, tricuspid annuloplasty and radial artery bypass graft to the first obtuse marginal artery. Warfarin therapy was initiated upon the diagnosis of APS. Despite being therapeutic on warfarin and aggressive risk factor management, he had yet another MI. Coronary angiogram at this time showed fresh occlusion of the right coronary artery at the mid-segment, and the patient received two overlapping stents that achieved a good effect. This case emphasizes the importance of awareness, early recognition and aggressive management of patients with APS presenting chest pain or acute coronary events. Despite appropriate treatment, such as risk factor management and percutaneous interventions, recurrence of an acute coronary event is high. The presentation of younger patients with recurrent coronary events but no significant risk factors of atherosclerosis should evoke the suspicion of APS-related coronary artery disease, and all risk factors should be aggressively managed.
