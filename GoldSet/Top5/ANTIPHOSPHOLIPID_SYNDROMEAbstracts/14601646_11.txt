Two-hundred ninety five patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) were studied for the presence of antibodies against six anti-beta2GPI-related peptides Abs. The prevalence of a wide spectrum of clinical and laboratory parameters of APS was evaluated in all patients, and correlated with the presence of each anti-beta2GPI peptide antibody. The rates of the various antipeptides Abs ranged from 18.0 to 63.7%. Altogether, 87.1% of the patients had antibody reactivity against at least one of the six beta2GPI-related peptides. A high degree of simultaneous reactivity against several beta2GPI-peptides was found. Positive and negative correlations were found between several antipeptides Abs and the rates of thrombosis and fetal loss. Our results point to a heterogeneous activity of antiphospholipid Abs in APS patients, directed, often concurrently, against various epitopes of the beta2GPI molecule. Evaluation of APS patients for the presence of specific antipeptides Abs may be of a value in predicting the risk for future thrombotic and obstetrical complication, as well as for specific therapeutic purposes.
