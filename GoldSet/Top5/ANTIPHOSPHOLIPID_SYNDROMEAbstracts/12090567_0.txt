The objective of this study was to describe clinical, laboratory, and radiological features in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with oculomotor palsy (OMP). Among a cohort of 750 SLE patients receiving follow-up at our unit between 1985 and 2000, all patients with OMP were studied. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded, as well as cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings where available. Immunological tests included tests for presence and specificity of antinuclear and antiphospholipid antibodies. Six patients had OMP, which occurred within the first 3 years in two patients and after more than 20 years in two patients. Four patients had focal neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) manifestations and two had diffuse neurological involvement. The four patients with focal NPSLE were either anticardiolipin- or lupus anticoagulant-positive. Cerebral fluid was abnormal in two of four patients who had this test. In four of the six patients, cerebral MRI showed evidence of vasculopathy. The therapeutic regimens varied, although all six patients initially received high-dose corticosteroids. OMP resolved or improved significantly in all six patients. OMP in SLE occurs in a broad spectrum of clinical situations but is an infrequent manifestation of NPSLE. This case series, together with literature review data, suggests various pathophysiological mechanisms in patients with focal or diffuse neurological symptoms. In patients with focal NPSLE, a possible cause of OMP is microthrombosis associated with presence of antiphospholipid antibodies.
