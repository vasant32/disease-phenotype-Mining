A case of recurrent cerebral infarctions in a 42-year-old woman affected by polyarteritis nodosa and antiphospholipid syndrome is reported. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed grossly thickened mitral valve leaflets, possibly related to the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Thus, an embolic source at mitral level is hypothesized.
