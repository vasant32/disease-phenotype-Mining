INTRODUCTION: Antiphospholipid syndrome is frequently associated with auto-immune disorders. EXEGESIS: We report the case of a 59-years-old woman with an antiphospholipid syndrome associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and/or relapsing polychondritis. CONCLUSION: This fatal evolution as a consequence of a delayed management shows that fast and invasive steps are required for diagnosis and treatment of systemic diseases.
