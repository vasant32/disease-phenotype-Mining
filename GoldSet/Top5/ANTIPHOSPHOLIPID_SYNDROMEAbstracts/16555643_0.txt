We report a case of a 26- year old woman having antiphospholipid syndrome in pregnancy with long-term follow up. She presented with recurrent miscarriages, venous thrombosis, avascular necrosis of femoral head, mid-cerebral artery infarction and skin ulcers. Antiphospholipid syndrome is a recognized disorder of pregnancy. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion when evaluating women with recurrent pregnancy losses and vascular thrombosis. A low dose aspirin combined with heparin can reduce morbidity and improves the pregnancy outcome.
