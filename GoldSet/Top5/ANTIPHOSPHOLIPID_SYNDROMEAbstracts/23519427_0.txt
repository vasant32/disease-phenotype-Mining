The aim of this study is to explore the role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) in primary and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Thirty patients of APS (24 primary and 6 secondary) were recruited in the study who fulfilled the revised Sapporo criteria. Control groups comprised of age- and sex-matched 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients each of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis without any antecedent thrombotic event and/or APS-related pregnancy morbidity. Serum samples were tested for PAI-1 antigen levels measured by quantitative ELISA. Positivity rate of PAI-1 in patients of primary, secondary as well as total APS patients was significantly higher in relation to age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (p = 0.010, p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively). Mean ± SEM levels of PAI-1 in primary and secondary as well as total APS patients were significantly higher (p = 0.006, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001) in relation to healthy controls. Correlation of PAI-1 levels (mean ± SEM) with clinical characteristics, that is, thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity, revealed significantly higher levels of PAI-1 (p < 0.001) in patients having thrombosis and APS-related pregnancy morbidity. Elevated PAI-1 level leading to impaired fibrinolysis plays a significant role in producing hypercoagulable state in primary and secondary APS.
