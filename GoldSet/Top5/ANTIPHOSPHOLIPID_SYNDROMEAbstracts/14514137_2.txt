Anetoderma is an uncommon disorder characterized by the loss of elastic fibres in the dermis histologically and herniation of subcutaneous tissue clinically. Recent studies indicate that immunologic mechanisms may play a role in this process. Here we report a 33-year-old woman with numerous well-circumscribed, asymptomatic skin lesions in whom clinical and histopathologic features were consistent with anetoderma. Additionally, history and investigations revealed antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. It has been speculated that immune deposits in the dermis or within the capillary walls may lead to ischaemia and subsequent degeneration of the elastic fibres.
