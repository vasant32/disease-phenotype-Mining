 OBJECTIVE: Anti-prothrombin (aPT) antibodies have been found in Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) positive patients. Their prevalence and relative contribution to thromboembolic risk in LA-positive patients is not well defined. The aim of this study was to determine their presence and association with thromboembolic events in a large series of patients with confirmed LA. METHODS: Plasma from LA-positive patients was collected at Thrombosis Centers and sent to a reference central laboratory for confirmation. Positive plasma was tested using home-made ELISA for the presence of aPT and anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies. RESULTS: LA was confirmed in 231 patients. Sixty-one of 231 (26%, 95%CI 22-33) LA positive subjects were positive for IgG aPT and 62 (27%, 95% CI 21-33) were positive for IgM aPT antibodies. Clinical features of Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) were not associated with the presence of IgG aPT [43 APS in 61 (70%) positive and 109 APS in 170 (64%) negative IgG aPT subjects, p=ns] or IgM aPT. Rate of positivity of IgG and IgM a beta(2)GPI was significantly higher than that of IgG and IgM aPT. Clinical events accounting for APS occurred in 97 of 130 (75%) IgG a beta(2)GPI positive and in 55 of 101 (54%) IgG a beta(2)GPI negative patients (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4 to 4.3, p=0.002). No significant association with clinical events in patients positive for both IgG aPT and IgG a beta(2)GPI as compared to those positive for one or another test was found. When patients negative for both IgG aPT and IgG a beta(2)GPI (LA positive only) were compared with remaining patients, a significantly lower association with clinical events was found (OR=0.4, 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.7, p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: As compared to IgG a beta(2)GPI, the prevalence of IgG aPT in patients with LA is significantly lower and not associated with the clinical features of APS.
