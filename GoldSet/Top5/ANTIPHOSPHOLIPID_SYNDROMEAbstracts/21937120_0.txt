Post-stroke depression is a potentially persistent complication of stroke. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for depression, but with limited data regarding safety in stroke patients. We report the case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of stroke and antiphospholipid syndrome, who became depressed and suicidal. Neurologic and Internal Medicine consults did not reveal any contraindications to ECT, but stroke risk factor management was identified as an important measure for patient safety. The patient tolerated ECT well, reporting improvement of mood and abatement of hopelessness. This case suggests that ECT may be a safe and well-tolerated treatment for post-stroke depression.
