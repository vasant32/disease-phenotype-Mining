Anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies are considered as a specific marker for the antiphospholipid syndrome. In contrast to lupus circulating anticoagulant and anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies, they are usually not found at significant levels in infections. We report a case of pulmonary embolism in an adult with varicella. Transient significant levels of aCL antibodies and of IgM anti-beta2-GPI antibodies were observed. No other prothrombotic factor, including free protein S antigen deficiency, was found. The direct pathogenic role of these transient antibodies on the thrombotic event may then be suspected. They are probably associated with VZV acute infection and are absent two months after varicella.
