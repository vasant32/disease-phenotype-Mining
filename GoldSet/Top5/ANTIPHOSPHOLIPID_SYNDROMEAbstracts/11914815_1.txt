Antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs) are circulating immunoglobulins associated with a hypercoagulable state. The antiphospholipid syndrome combines APAs and clinical manifestations, including arterial or venous thromboses and/or recurrent spontaneous fetal loss. The main risk incurred by endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms is the occurrence of thromboembolic events. We report two cases of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who developed thromboembolic complications after the endovascular treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms.
