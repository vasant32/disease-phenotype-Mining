The aim of the study was the assessment of the prevalence of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 72 patients with SLE had been investigated, 66 females and six males, aged 17 to 70 years, average 37.03. The presence of APA was determined using both ELISA assay for antiphospholipid antibodies, ASSERACHROM APA by Diagnostica Stago and clotting tests for lupus anticoagulant: activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), tissue thromboplastin inhibition test (TTI) and dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT). Antiphospholipid antibodies have been found in 24 patients (33.44%), 10 of them were with positive lupus anticoagulant tests, 6 of them were with positive ELISA test, while 8 of them had positive coagulation and immunological tests. Clinical manifestations that could be related to antiphospholipid syndrome were present in 22 patients (30.5%). The most common were thrombotic complications in 16 patients (22.25), recurrent spontaneous abortions in 7 patients (9.7%) and thrombocytopenia in 1 patient (1.39%). Presence of antiphospholipid syndrome was determined in 15 patients (20.83%). We can conclude that there is a significant correlation between presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and both thrombotic events and recurrent spontaneous abortions in SLE patients. Occurrence of thrombotic complications is in direct correlation with the level of antiphospholipid antibodies.
