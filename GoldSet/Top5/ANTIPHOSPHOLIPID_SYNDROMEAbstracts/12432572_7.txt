Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) contain a wide spectrum of anti-idiotypes associated with autoimmune diseases. Since part of these anti-idiotypes may bear an internal image of the eliciting antigen, IVIG might be suitable for induction of oral tolerance. In the current study we attempted to induce tolerance in an experimental model of anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) by oral administration of IVIG. Naive mice were fed with IVIG, or anti-beta 2GPI-specific anti-idiotypic IVIG(alpha Id). Significantly diminished humoral response was noted in mice IVIG/ IVIG-F(ab')(2)or IVIG(alpha Id)-tolerized mice, accompanied by a significant attenuation of clinical manifestations. The maximal effect was achieved in the mice tolerized before disease induction. Abrogation of T lymphocyte proliferation to beta 2GPI was detected in the mice fed with IVIG prior to beta 2GPI immunization, mediated by TGFbeta and IL-10 secretion. The tolerance induced by IVIG-feeding was nonspecific and could be adoptively transferred to syngeneic mice by CD8alpha (+) cells. These CD8alpha (+) T cells, were found to secrete high levels of TGFbeta and IL-10. In summary, IVIG-induced oral tolerance has a nonspecific immunomodulatory effect in experimental APS, mediated by TGFbeta and IL-10-secreting CD8alpha (+) cells. Our results point to a possible application of IVIG in the induction of oral tolerance against various autoimmune diseases.
