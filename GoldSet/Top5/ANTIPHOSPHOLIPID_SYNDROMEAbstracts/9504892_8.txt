A 58-year-old Korean man who had a past history of appendicitis, superior mesenteric vein thrombosis and intestinal obstruction presented 7 years later suffering from colicky right upper quadrant pain, epigastric discomfort after fatty meals, nausea and vomiting. He was found to have thrombosis of the superior mesenteric and portal veins, portal hypertension with oesophageal varices, cholangitis, and a biliary stone. The serum anti-cardiolipin antibody (aCL) titres were 103 immunoglobulin (Ig)G antiphospholipid units (GPL) and 50 IgM antiphospholipid units (MPL) and the aCL-IgG titre was still high at 106 2 years after the initial diagnosis. No evidence of disease states known to be associated with antiphospholipid antibodies was found. We report a patient with mesenteric and portal venous obstruction associated with the primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).
