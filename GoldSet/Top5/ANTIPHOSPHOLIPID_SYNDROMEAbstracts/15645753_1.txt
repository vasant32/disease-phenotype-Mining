We report a patient with a previously known primary antiphospholipid syndrome who had life threatening multiple arterial thromboses. The patient experienced a myocardial infarction with intraventricular thrombi under bromocriptine therapy in the puerperium, despite prophylactic low molecular weight heparin therapy. In this patient, no microvascular involvement was identified, thus eliminating the diagnosis of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. Arterial thromboses may be explained by peripheral emboli originating from the intraventricular thrombi. This case emphasizes the necessity of a careful evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of bromocriptine therapy in patients with arterial risk factors. It also emphasizes the need for a correct diagnosis of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome allowing to limit the prescription of aggressive therapies.
