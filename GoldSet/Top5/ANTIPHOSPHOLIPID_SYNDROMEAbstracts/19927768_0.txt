 BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases are frequently associated with extra-intestinal manifestations and other autoimmune disorders. Association between primary sclerosing cholangitis and Crohn's disease is established. However, the association of antiphospholipid syndrome with Crohn's disease was reported in the literature only in the form of isolated case reports. AIMS: To report a Tunisian case of association of Crohn's disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis and antiphospholipid syndrome. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a patient presenting a colonic Crohn's disease associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis and antiphospholipid syndrome. Sclerosing cholangitis was diagnosed basing on disturbances of the hepatic biochemical tests. Antiphospholipid syndrome was revealed by a venous thrombosis of the lower limbs. CONCLUSION: Although the anticardiolipin antibodies were frequently found during the course of primary sclerosing cholangitis, the association with antiphospholipid syndrome is exceptionally described. In the same way, triple association of primary sclerosing cholangitis, Crohn's disease and antiphospholipid syndrome was not brought back in the literature.
