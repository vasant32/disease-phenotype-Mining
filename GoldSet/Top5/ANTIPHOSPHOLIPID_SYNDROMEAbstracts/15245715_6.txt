Hughes' syndrome (the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)) presents with recurrent thrombosis, recurrent miscarriage and neurological disease. The major pathogenic mechanism of the syndrome is vascular obstruction (both venous and arterial) due to hypercoagulability. Neurological manifestations are prominent and are often the dominant feature. Headache, migraine and cognitive dysfunction are common while other manifestations such as dementia, epilepsy, chorea, multiple sclerosis (MS), psychiatric disease, transverse myelitis, ocular syndromes, sensorineural hearing loss and movement disorders are also associated with the syndrome. Anticoagulation therapy (either aspirin or oral anticoagulants) can lead to significant improvement.
