We report a case of HELLP syndrome, multiple liver infarctions, and intrauterine fetal death in a woman in the 17th week of pregnancy with SLE and APS who had been in remission on a regimen of low-dose prednisolone and aspirin. An increase in the dosage of corticosteroid together with intravenous heparin infusion led to improvement of the clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters, and multifocal low-density liver lesions detected by computed tomography. Early onset and signs of severe organ involvement are the characteristic features of HELLP syndrome associated with APS, and patients that are at risk should be followed up carefully.
