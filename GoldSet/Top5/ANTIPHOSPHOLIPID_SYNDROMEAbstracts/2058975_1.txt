Habitual abortion is sometimes an incurable pathogenetic state. Even more serious to both the patient and gynecologist is that the incidence of repeated reproductive wastage is higher in subsequent pregnancies. We registered more than 1,000 women with repeated spontaneous abortions in this clinic for 5 years and analyzed their pathogenesis for the wastages by several different approaches. One hundred twenty-four women were diagnosed as having a congenital uterine abnormality. Metroplasty was performed in 50 patients, resulting in 82% successful subsequent pregnancies, whereas more than 98% of the pregnancies had terminated in spontaneous abortion before the operation. By measuring anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) and lupus anticoagulant (LA), the present study diagnosed several cases as antiphospholipid syndrome, and successfully pregnant patients were observed and treated with appropriate medications. Fifty-five partners of 54 couples had either a chromosomal abnormality or normal variants, showing a high incidence of spontaneous abortion in each type of abnormality. In the other 311 cases, female partners were treated by the immunotherapy of the husbands' lymphocytes in pre- and postgestational periods. Among them, 200 women became pregnant, and 147 cases successfully maintained the pregnancy. These studies indicate that early diagnosis through comprehensive examinations is essential for effective treatment of curable fetal loss in human reproduction.
