 BACKGROUND: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is defined as the presence of repeated episodes of arterial or venous thrombosis, recurrent spontaneous abortions and thrombocytopenia in patients with elevated antiphospholipid antibodies. An important feature of APS are cerebrovascular disorders of thrombotic origin. The aim of the study was to assess cerebral blood flow changes utilising brain SPECT HMPAO scanning. METHODS: Brain SPECT (99m)Tc-HMPAO scanning was performed in 20 patients with APS: 12 with systemic lupus erythematosus, 4 with Sneddon's syndrome, 2 with Sj√∂gren's syndrome, 2 with primary APS. 30 healthy volunteers served as a control group. RESULTS: 19 studies were abnormal, 1 normal. Abnormalities consisted of multifocal perfusion deficits and diffuse decrease of regional blood flow. The average number of focal perfusion deficits was 4.8 +/- 1.7. In 7 patients diffuse hypoperfusion of frontal lobes was seen, in 1 patient additionally hypoperfusion of temporal and occipital lobes. There was a correlation between the number of focal perfusion deficits and cognitive impairment in this group of patients. Correlation between SPECT images and clinical data was moderate in cerebellar syndrome and paresis, weak in persistent headache and vertigo. CONCLUSIONS: Those results indicate the high utility of CBF brain SPECT scanning in antiphospholipid syndrome.
