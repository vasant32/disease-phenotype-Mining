A patient with a history of early onset preeclampsia and repeated fetal death, high titer IgG anticardiolopin antibodies and prolonged aPTT was treated during her third pregnancy with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) from the seventh month of pregnancy onwards. Every month--after a loading dose of 30 g immunoglobulins--a daily infusion of 3 g immunoglobulin was for three days was given during six consecutive cycles. The patients pregnancy ended preterm with a life birth, delivered by cesarean section, because of a severe preeclampsia. The 1600 g weighing boy was in good health. Each treatment with IVIG resulted in a reduction of anticardiolipin-antibodies. During the seventh months observation period, a gradual increase in PAI activity/factor VIIIR:Ag was found. A partial transient reduction of antiphospholipid-antibody levels was observed immediately following each treatment course resulting in an accelerated fetal outcome.
