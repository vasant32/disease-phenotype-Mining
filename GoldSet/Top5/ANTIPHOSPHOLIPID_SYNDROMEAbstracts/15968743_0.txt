We here report a recent, rare case of Budd-Chiari syndrome, associated with a combination of hepatic vein and superior vena cava occlusion. A young female, who had been in good health, was admitted to our hospital because of massive ascites. The patient had used no oral contraceptives. Tests for coagulation disorders, hematological disorders, and antiphospholipid syndrome were all negative. Budd-Chiari syndrome was diagnosed by radiographic examination. The patient was suffering from a combination of hepatic vein and superior vena cava occlusion. In particular, the venous flow returned from the liver mainly through a right accessory hepatic vein, and stenosis was recognized at the orifice of this collateral vein into the vena cava. Subsequently, the patient underwent percutaneous balloon dilatation therapy for this stenosis. After this treatment, the massive ascites was gradually reduced, and she was discharged from our hospital. It has now been one year since discharge, and the patient has been doing well. If deteriorating liver function or intractable ascites occur again, a liver transplantation may be anticipated. This is the first case report of Budd-Chiari syndrome associated with a superior vena cava occlusion.
