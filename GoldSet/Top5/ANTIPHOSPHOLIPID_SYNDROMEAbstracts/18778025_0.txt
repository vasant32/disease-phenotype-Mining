Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is one of the most common reasons of thromboembolic complications in the course of connective tissue diseases. There is a strong relationship between presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and the risk of thrombosis. APS related thromboembolic complications range from superficial vein thrombosis up to rapidly developing, life threatening, multi-organ embolism. We present a case of a 21-year old female who presented with myocardial infarction as the first symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus and APS. Afterwards she was consequently treated with antithrombotic and anti-aggregation agents but it did not prevent her from reoccurrence of middle retinal vein. During the 10-year follow up she presented with reoccurring neurological symptoms i.e.: headache, memory deficits, concentration loss and impairment of the cognitive functions. She was found many times to be positive for IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-beta2glicoprotein-I antibodies and lupus anticoagulant.
