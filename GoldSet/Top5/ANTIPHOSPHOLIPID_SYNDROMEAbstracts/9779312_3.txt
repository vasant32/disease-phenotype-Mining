OBJECTIVE: The outcome of 55 infants born to 53 antiphospholipid antibody (aPL)-positive mothers treated during pregnancy with calcium heparin is described. METHODS: The clinical state of the children was evaluated immediately after delivery by a clinical examination, and a neonatological check-up was performed no later than 24 hours after birth. Neonates with problems were transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. After their discharge from hospital the clinical state of the babies was followed by means of interviews with the pediatricians and mothers for a period varying between 1.33 and 5.66 years (mean 2.51 +/- 0.92 SD). RESULTS: The newborns comprised 30 females and 25 males, including 2 sets of twins, delivered between the 25th and 40th weeks of gestation (mean 36.69 +/- 2.91 SD). They had a mean birth weight of 2.828 g +/- 706.50 SD (range 800-4.000) and a mean Apgar score at 5 minutes of 9.60 +/- 0.68 SD (range 7-10). Soon after delivery, 12 children (21.81%) were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for periods varying between 2 and 120 days (mean 30.33 +/- 33.40 SD), after which the clinical course was normal. All of these neonates suffered from complications exclusively due to prematurity. Malformations and signs of thrombosis or other aPL-related disorders were not observed in any of the newborns. During the follow-up, none of the diseases suffered by the 55 children differed from those of the normal pediatric population; in particular, aPL-related manifestations were never observed. CONCLUSION: These data indicate the absence of aPL-related problems in the offspring of aPL-positive mothers treated during pregnancy with calcium heparin.
