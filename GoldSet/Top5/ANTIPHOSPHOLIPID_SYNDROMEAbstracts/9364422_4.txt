CNS involvement is one of the hallmarks underlying poor prognosis in SLE and for therapeutic strategies it is difficult to assess which patients are at risk. As detectability of cerebral microembolic signals (MES) using long-term transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) proved to be predictive of past and future thromboembolic events in patients with carotid artery stenosis, we investigated whether MES might be similarly useful in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Our study population consisted of 46 SLE patients and five with primary APS (pAPS). Twelve of the 46 patients with SLE, 10 of them with secondary APS (sAPS), and four of five patients with pAPS had a history of cerebrovascular ischaemia (CVI). MES in the middle cerebral artery were detected in 14 of 16 patients with and in one of 35 without CVI (P < 0.001). Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) were positive in 12 of 15 patients with and 18 of 36 without MES, and the rate of MES correlated to the titre of aPL. MES from APS patients resembled in their energy distribution those from patients with symptomatic carotid disease and were significantly different from those associated with artificial heart valves. In conclusion, cerebral MES are detectable in APS patients and correlate with a history of CVI. Whether this innovative method may provide individual risk assessment in APS patients has to be addressed in prospective studies.
