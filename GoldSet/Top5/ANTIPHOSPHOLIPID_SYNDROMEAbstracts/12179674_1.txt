This paper reports the first documented case of Takayasu's arteritis and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome complicating a pregnancy in a 29-year-old gravida-4 para-3 (1200) woman with recurrent fetal losses.  The epidemiology, pathophysiology, effects of both diseases on pregnancy, diagnosis and management are discussed.  There is a significant relationship between recurrent fetal losses and circulating antiphospholipid antibodies; however, there is no such relationship between these recurrent fetal losses and Takayasu's arteritis.
