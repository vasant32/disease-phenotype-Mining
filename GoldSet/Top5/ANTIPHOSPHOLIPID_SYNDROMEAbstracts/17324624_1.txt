We report a case of spontaneous coronary artery dissection occurring in a young female who had been diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. Coronary angiography revealed extensive dissection in the proximal to mid LAD. She was treated conservatively with an excellent result. Follow-up coronary angiography at two months failed to reveal any evidence of the previous dissection.
