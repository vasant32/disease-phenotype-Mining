Primary cases of splanchnic vein thrombosis are now less common since a systematic screening for hypercoagulability is performed. In 1996, a sequence variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the prothrombin gene (F.II 20210G/A mutation) has been linked to a threefold increased risk for venous thrombosis. The role of this thrombophilic disorder is not documented in patients with thrombosis of the splanchnic veins. This report presents two patients with a mesenteric ischemia associated with a heterozygous state for the F.II 20210G/A mutation. The first patient developed an ischemic colitis and the second one an ischemic necrosis of the terminal ileum related to a thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein. In both cases, another thrombotic risk factor was associated: either a general prothrombic state (primary antiphospholipid syndrome) or a focal factor (abnormal hemodynamic conditions related to a liver cirrhosis). It has recently been proposed that several conditions need to be combined for deep vein thrombosis to develop. Screening for the combination of multiple underlying prothrombotic conditions thus appears justified in patients with splanchnic thrombosis. The role of the F.II 20210G/A mutation as a predisposing factor for thrombosis of the digestive vessels should be considered and needs further investigation.
