Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can be associated with many autoimmune disorders such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. The most common neurologic complication is represented by peripheral neuropathies, but its pathogenesis is still unknown. We report the clinical case of a 44-year-old woman with HIV infection, peripheral polyneuropathy and arterial thrombosis, in which high serum levels of antiphospholipid antibodies were repeatedly documented. We suggest that the evaluation of serum antiphospholipid antibodies levels in HIV infection is fundamental both from an exploratory point of view and for starting the best treatment.
