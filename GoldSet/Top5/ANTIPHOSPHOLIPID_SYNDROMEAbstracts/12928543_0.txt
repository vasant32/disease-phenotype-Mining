A 28-year-old patient presented with severe intrauterine fetal growth retardation (IUGR) at 34 weeks' gestation. There was a prior history of a recurrent cutaneous ulcer on the left thigh. Serological tests for IgG anticardiolipin antibody were positive. A live premature male infant was delivered by an urgent cesarean section because of fetal distress. Histopathological examination revealed that the causes of the cutaneous ulcer and IUGR were thrombosis of the small blood vessels and placental infarction, respectively. Early diagnosis and proper treatment are important in the management of the antiphospholipid syndrome.
