The aim of this study was to compare whether oxidized LDL (oxLDL), anti-oxLDL and anti-annexin (anx) A5 antibodies are associated with clinical features of primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS), and to compare these to well-defined groups of non-PAPS myocardial infarction survivors (non-PAPS MI) and to non-PAPS patients with pulmonary emboli (non-PAPS PE). All parameters investigated were analyzed by ELISA using commercial reagents. PAPS patients with MI, in comparison to the group of non-PAPS MI survivors, had significantly elevated concentrations of oxLDL (p = 0.003) and anti-oxLDL antibodies (p = 0.024). Anti-anxA5 antibodies of the IgG isotype were associated with recurrent abortions (OR = 4.788, p = 0.036, 95% CI: 1.104 - 20.762). OxLDL and anti-oxLDL antibodies represent additional risk factors which, together with other factors, might lead to complications of arterial thromboses, such as myocardial infarctions in PAPS, while association of IgG anti-anxA5 antibodies with recurrent abortions is a reflection of the small number of patients with this feature involved in the study and should therefore be investigated further.
