We report the case of a 34-year-old white man with a 7-year history of nodules on the face, neck, upper torso, and arms which evolved to anetodermic lesions. After onset of these lesions, deep vein thrombosis developed in the patient's right arm and leg in association with circulating antiphospholipid antibodies.
