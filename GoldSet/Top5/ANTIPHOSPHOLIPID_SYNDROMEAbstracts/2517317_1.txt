The presence of a lupus anticoagulant (LA) is paradoxically associated with a high incidence of arterial and venous thrombosis. In a patient with a lupus-like systemic disease, having received phenindione for 11 years, LA was discovered in association with recurrent deep venous thrombosis, a right atrial thrombus, coronary occlusion, arterial hypertension, thrombopenia, and anticardiolipin antibodies without anti-DNA antibodies. Renal cortical ischemia was detected by a tomographic scan. Renal biopsy showed glomerular ischemia and diffuse interstitial fibrosis. After a one-year anticoagulant and steroid therapy, LA has disappeared despite a high level of anticardiolipin antibodies, and renal function remains normal.
