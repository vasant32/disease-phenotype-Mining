INTRODUCTION: CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cell dysfunction has been documented in various autoimmune disorders, but not in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) so far. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we aim to investigate CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells, CD3(+)CD19(-) T cells and CD3(-)CD19(+) B cells in patients with primary APS and healthy controls. Cell subtypes were immunophenotyped using specific monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD3 CY5, anti-CD4 FITC, anti-CD25, anti-Foxp3, anti-CD19 PE) and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Twenty patients with APS and 20 age- and sex-matched controls were studied. The percentage of total lymphocytes, activated Th cells (CD4+CD25+), Treg cells and CD3(-)CD19(+) B cells were found significantly lower in APS patients as compared to controls (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A dysfunction in CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells may represent one of the mechanisms leading to autoimmunity in APS patients. The decreased number of CD3(-)CD19(+) B cells of APS patients warrants further elucidation.
