 OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate antiphospholipid antibodies and antiphospholipid syndrome frequency (according to current criteria) in women with recurrent miscarriages. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 105 women diagnosed due to recurrent miscarriages. Patients were divided into 2 groups: with early recurrent miscarriages and with late recurrent miscarriages. The third group was the control group composed of 30 healthy women without poor obstetric history and having at least one child. All women were screened for the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies: anticardiolipin antibodies, anti beta2-glycoprotein antibodies and lupus anticoagulant. RESULTS: Antiphospholipid antibodies were found in 12.4% of women with recurrent pregnancy loss and in 13.3% of the controls. Among 87 patients in group I with early recurrent miscarriages the most common antibodies were: anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (9.2%), anticardiolipin antibodies (4.6%) and lupus anticoagulant (1.1%). Anti beta2-glycoprotein antibodies were the only antibodies found in 18 women in group II with recurrent late miscarriages. There were 13.3% aPL-positive cases in the control group. Among the studied population, there were only two patients (2.3%) fulfilling the criteria of APS. CONCLUSIONS: 1. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in low titers in women with pregnancy loss is unequivocal with antiphospholipid syndrome. 2. APL screening should be limited to a restricted group of women.
