Strokes are the main neurological manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome. Other clinical presentations are possible and may mimic classic symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). A 46-year-old woman, with a history of two miscarriages, presented four subacute neurological episodes (optic neuritis, right facial paralysis, paraparesis of the thigh, and right brachial monoparesis). Using McDonald criteria, the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was retained. Because of the occurrence of thrombocytopenia during a final relapse, we reconsidered the diagnosis of MS. Search for antiphospholipid antibodies was positive. All clinical manifestations and complementary tests were compatible with the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome associated with multiple sclerosis. Given the great similarity of clinical, radiological and biological findings in the two diseases, non-thrombotic neurological manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome can be difficult to distinguish from MS associated with antiphospholipid syndrome.
