Antibodies recognizing anionic phospholipids have been described in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune diseases. Recent studies have shown that some of these antibodies may recognize a cardiolipin-binding protein (apolipoprotein H) rather than phospholipids. A similar possibility is conceivable for other cardiolipin-binding proteins that are targets of autoantibodies. In this study we have addressed whether this might be the case for histones, a set of highly cationic and widely distributed proteins that react in a well known autoantibody system. Our results indicate that: (i) histones bind to anionic phospholipids (cardiolipin and phosphatidylserine) with high avidity, but not to zwitterionic phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine); (ii) monoclonal and polyclonal antihistone antibodies recognize histones bound to cardiolipin; (iii) the addition of histones to serum samples containing antihistone antibodies often enhances their anticardiolipin reactivity. In addition, we have found that antihistone-producing hybridomas derived from MRL-lpr mice may show anticardiolipin activity due to the presence of histones in the cell culture supernatants with the resultant formation of immune complexes. Taken together, the results suggest a potential role for histones in the anti-cardiolipin activity detected in sera containing antihistone antibodies. These histone-phospholipid interactions should be taken into account when evaluating the pathogenic effects of antihistone antibodies or other autoantibodies reacting with nuclear components (e.g. nucleosomes) containing histones.
