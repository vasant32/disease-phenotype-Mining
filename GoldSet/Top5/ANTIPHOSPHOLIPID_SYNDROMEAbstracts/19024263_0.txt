Antiphospholipid syndrome includes the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, vascular thrombosis and reproductive function disturbances. The aim was to show our diagnostic and therapeutic experiences. 62 women were included in study, 32 with primary antiphospholipd syndrome (PAPS), and 30 with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (SAPS). 36 were pregnant and studied prospectively throughout pregnancy and six weeks after the delivery. Lupus-anticoagulant (LA) was positive in 23 patients with PAPS (71.9%), and in 10 patients with SAPS (33.3%). In SAPS group anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) was positive in 8 patients (26.6%) compared to PAPS group with 3 aCL positive patients (9.4%). Antibeta2glycoprotein1 (antibeta2GP1) was positive in 3 patients with PAPS. Complications in previous pregnancies were in 25 cases (69.4%) spontaneous abortion, in 7 cases (19.4%) preeclampsia with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) in 3 patients. In 4 cases the complication was fetal death in utero. Average pregnancy lasted 37.06+/-0.707 weeks. Therapy with low dose aspirin and low-molecular-weight heparin was successful in 97.2%.
