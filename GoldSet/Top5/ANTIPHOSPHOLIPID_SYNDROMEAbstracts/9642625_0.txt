First-degree relatives (FDRs) of diabetic patients are at risk of IDDM, and frequently present several autoantibodies. We detected anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in 42 FDRs, aged 12.4 +/- 4.2 years and in 52 controls. aCL (IgG and IgM) were measured by ELISA and their results expressed in arbitrary units. All FDRs underwent islet cell antibodies (ICA) measurement, intravenous glucose tolerance test and HbA1c levels. HLA typing and HLA-DQ molecular analysis were performed in all FDRs. Positive levels of aCL-IgG were observed in 8/42 FDRs and no control subject (p = 0.04); aCL-IgM values were similar in FDRs and controls. No correlation was found between aCL levels and chronologic age or HbA1c levels. No association was observed between aCL frequency and immunologic (ICA), metabolic or genetic (HLA) parameters. No FDR showed any feature of antiphospholipid syndrome. aCL-IgG presence in FDRs is suggestive of a need to carry out a follow-up study to establish the significance of these antibodies.
