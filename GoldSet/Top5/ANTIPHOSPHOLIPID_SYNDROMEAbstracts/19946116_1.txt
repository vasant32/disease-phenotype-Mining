Libman-Sacks endocarditis, characterized by sterile fibrofibrinous vegetations that have the potential to develop anywhere on the endocardial surface, was originally reported in 1924. The mitral valve is most commonly affected, followed by the aortic valve, whereas tricuspid and pulmonary valves are seldom involved. Libman-Sacks vegetations can be found in approximately 1 of 10 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus by transoesophageal echocardiography (TTE), and they are variably associated with lupus duration, disease activity, anticardiolipin antibodies, and antiphospholipid syndrome manifestations. The capability to perform real-time 3D (RT3D) imaging in the evaluation of Libman-Sacks vegetation size may strengthen the already established role of transthoracic echocardiogram and TTE. The exact estimation of vegetation size may influence therapeutic interventions. Therefore, we are trying to highlight the role of RT3D echocardiography in assessing vegetation size in a patient with Libman-Sacks endocarditis.
