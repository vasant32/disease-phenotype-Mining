High-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a marker of inflammation which has been shown in several prospective studies to independently predict myocardial infarction, stroke and peripheral artery disease. Patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are at increased risk of recurrent thromboembolic events, but the possibility of predicting this risk seems rather limited. Similarities were recently found between aPL and CRP in the pathology of thrombosis. The current study investigated the predictive role of hs-CRP in a cohort of patients with neurological manifestations. A follow-up investigation was done in a cohort of 55 aPL-positive patients with acute manifestations of neurological disease. hs-CRP levels were measured in all patients at enrollment and were compared to the patients' condition after a median period of 32 months. Lupus anticoagulants were detected according to the Standardization of Lupus Anticoagulants (SSC) of the ISTH. Anticardiolipin tests were performed by a beta2-glycoprotein I-dependent enzyme-linked immunsorbent assay (Pharmacia ELISA). hs-CRP was measured by latex-enhanced turbidometry (dimension RXL, Dade Behring). Cerebral infarctions and transient ischemic attacks were the most frequent cerebral events. In patients with aPL, elevated levels of hs-CRP were closely associated with an increased rate of recurrent or residual symptoms (OR, 12.5; 95% CI, 3.72-41.94) and were not related to other risk factors, except smoking (p<0.05). The rate at which a given patient's condition deteriorated was also related to the level of hs-CRP. In patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), elevated levels of hs-CRP may identify a group of patients which is at high risk of recurrent or residual neurological symptoms and which may benefit from more careful follow-up and from antithrombotic therapy.
