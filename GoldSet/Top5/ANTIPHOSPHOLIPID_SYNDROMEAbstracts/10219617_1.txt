We report the first case of acute acalculous cholecystitis associated with primary antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome. The diagnosis was serological and was based on positive tests for lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin antibodies. The treatment was exclusively medical. Cholecystitis was cured with low-molecular weight heparin and oral anticoagulants. A rapid diagnosis can prevent lack of therapeutic errors such as surgery, antibiotherapy or corticotherapy, and long-term anticoagulant treatment can be proposed to prevent recurrent thrombosis.
