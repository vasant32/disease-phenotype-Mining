We describe a 24-year old Caucasian man with gangrene of small bowels and intestinal resection due to mesenteric inflammatory veno-occlusive disease (MIVOD) who later developed deep vein thrombosis in his left leg. He had no clinical evidence of an underlying symptomatic connective tissue disease or Beh√ßet's disease. An IgG anticardiolipin antibody titre above 60 GPL unit/mL and thrombocytopenia confirmed the diagnosis of primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). This is the first known case of APS associated with MIVOD.
