Sneddon's syndrome is a particular and rare entity that mostly affects young women and whose diagnosis is based on the coexistence of a cuteaneous livedo and a cerebrovascular ischemic attack. It had be considered as being an expression of an occlusive vasculitis or of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. We report the case of a 20-year-old female, who had developed a left homonymous hemianopia after ischemic encephalopathy. Visual field examination confirmed the presence of a complete left homonymous hemianopia. Cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging revealed right occipital cerebrovascular ischemic lesions. Sneddon's syndrome diagnosis was considered on the presence of cutaneous livedo reticularis and associated cerebral ischemic events. With medical treatment, a small functional improvement could be noticed but without net improvement in the visual field defect.
