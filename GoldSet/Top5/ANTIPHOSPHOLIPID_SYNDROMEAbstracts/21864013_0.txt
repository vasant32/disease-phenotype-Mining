 PURPOSE: To report a case of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) following toxoplasma retinochoroiditis. DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHOD: The patient was a 24-year-old female with an attack of visual loss due to toxoplasma retinochoroiditis concomitant with branch retinal vein occlusion. Retinitis resolved with anti-toxoplasma treatment. However, a recurrent episode of BRVO and vitreous hemorrhage occurred later. RESULT: In systemic evaluation, evidence of APS was detected, including high titers of anti-cardiolipin antibody, increased beta-2 microglobulin and anti-toxoplasma IgG antibody, and also low titers of C3, C4, and CH50. CONCLUSION: Ocular toxoplasmosis should be included in the list of etiologies of secondary APS. Systemic evaluation for detection of APS is a necessary approach to patients with toxoplasma retinochoroiditis and concomitant vascular accident.
