A case of disseminated lupus erythematosus with chorea is reported. CT was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple focal lesions on T2-weighted sequences, predominating in the periventricular white matter. This MRI pattern did not change in a second MRI investigation, 7 months later. The contribution of MRI to our understanding of the neurolupus pathophysiology is discussed.
