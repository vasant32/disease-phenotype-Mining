Loss of vision and periocular swelling can be an early manifestation of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. In May 2010, a 27-year-old lady was referred to us for an ophthalmological assessment on account of unilateral lid and conjunctival swelling. She was a medical inpatient receiving treatment for adrenal insufficiency caused by spontaneous adrenal haemorrhages. She was initially felt to have a viral conjunctivitis based on a visual acuity of 6/9 and inflammation limited to the left ocular surface (fig 1A). Rapid, but painless, progression of signs prompted a further request for assessment 48 hours later. On this occasion, she could only perceive hand movements in the left eye and was found to have an ipsilateral orbitopathy with proptosis and restricted ocular motility. Unusually, her fundal examination showed large areas of retinal pallor with haemorrhages suggestive of retinal necrosis. There were no abnormalities noted in the fellow right eye. The possibility of an orbital cellulitis, with co-existing viral acute retinal necrosis, was raised in view of her on-going treatment with corticosteroids for adrenal insufficiency. Treatment with intravenous antibiotic and antiviral agents was commenced immediately. An urgent computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain, paranasal sinuses and orbits was undertaken. This confirmed left-sided proptosis (fig 1B) but failed to reveal sinus disease or evidence of a localised abscess. Varicella zoster, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex were not detected by polymerase chain reaction undertaken on samples from a left anterior chamber tap and vitreous biopsy.
