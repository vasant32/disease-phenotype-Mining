The Obstetrical Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (OAAS) is representing a separate entity of the global Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APS), focusing the pregnancy morbidity. OAAS is generating morphopathological changes in almost all components of the gestational biologic transitory system (GBTS): placenta, umbilical cord or uterine wall. The most important, serious and lengthened anomalies are occuring in placenta. Our research has been developed on a group of 68 patients diagnosed with OAAS, initially using the Sapporo criteria and later using the "Sydney" ones. There have been morphopathologically examined: placenta, umbilical cord and myometrium. Histological examination revealed on one hand macroscopic modifications: fibrinoid deposits, white or red placental infarctions, intervillous thrombosis, marginal or basal decidual hematoma, calcareous deposits, umbilical cord thrombosis, and on the other hand microscopic findings: placental infarction, fibrinoid necrosis, myometrial thrombosis, degenerative myometrial disorders, focal myometrial necrosis, villous stasis and necrosis, umbilical cord thrombosis. Because of the increased prothrombotic background, in APS, any vessel or organ could be involved, with no exception for GBTS elements. The basis of the pregnancy morbidity from the obstetrical APS is represented by the morphopathological changes occurring in fetal adnexa and uterine structures.
