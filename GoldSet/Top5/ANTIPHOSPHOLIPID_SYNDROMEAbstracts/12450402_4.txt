Antiphospholipid antibodies interact with phospholipid membranes via lipid binding plasma proteins, mostly, prothrombin and beta(2)-glycoprotein I. Using ellipsometry, we characterized prothrombin-mediated binding of lupus anticoagulant (LA) positive IgG, isolated from patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, to phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing membranes. LA IgG did not bind to membranes in the absence of prothrombin, but addition of prothrombin resulted in high-affinity binding of prothrombin-LA IgG complexes; half-maximal binding was attained at IgG and prothrombin concentrations of 10 microg/mL and 4 nM, respectively. Adsorption to membranes containing 10-40 mol % PS revealed that membrane-bound rather than solution-phase prothrombin determines the adsorption kinetics. Depletion of prothrombin and LA IgG from the solution results in rapid desorption which is strongly inhibited by addition of prothrombin but not of LA IgG. Prothrombin-mediated adsorption of monovalent Fab1 fragments prepared from patient LA IgG was negligible, indicating that monovalent interaction between prothrombin and LA IgG is weak. The kinetics of adsorption and desorption indicate that divalent binding of LA IgG to prothrombin at the lipid membrane occurs.
