Budd-Chiari syndrome is a spectrum of manifestations which develops as a result of hepatic venous outflow obstruction. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a minimally invasive vascular and interventional radiological procedure indicated in the management of refractory ascites in such patients. Conventional TIPS requires the presence of a patent hepatic vein and reasonable accessibility to the portal vein, and in patients with totally occluded hepatic veins, this procedure is technically challenging. Direct intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (DIPS) or so called "percutaneous TIPS" involves ultrasound-guided percutaneous simultaneous puncture of the portal vein and inferior vena cava followed by introduction of a guidewire through the portal vein into the inferior vena cava, as a deviation from conventional TIPS. Described here is our experience with DIPS. Three patients with BCS who had refractory ascites but were unsuitable for conventional TIPS due to occlusion of the hepatic veins were chosen to undergo the DIPS procedure. Our technical success was 100%. The shunts placed in two patients remain patent to date, while the shunt in a third patient with underlying antiphospholipid syndrome was occluded a month after the procedure. The percutaneous TIPS procedure seems to be technically feasible and effective in the management of refractory ascites as a result of BCS, particularly in the setting of occluded hepatic veins.
