 INTRODUCTION: Thrombosis - the main manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) - is at the same time observed in some patients with malignancies. OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of prevalence of some antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in serum of patients with breast carcinoma and the possible correlation between aPL seropositivity and clinical symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 40 patients with breast carcinoma and 38 patients with non-malignant diseases of breast were studied. Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and antibodies to beta2 glycoprotein-I (anti-beta2GPI) were detected by ELISA. RESULTS: The aCL as well as anti-beta2GPI were positive in 1 patient with breast carcinoma, who at the same time presented with symptoms of APS. In the control group 2 patients were positive for anti-beta2GPI. CONCLUSIONS: We have not observed a difference of aPL prevalence between the group of patients with breast carcinoma and controls. The association of breast cancer and aPL seropositivity deserves further investigations.
