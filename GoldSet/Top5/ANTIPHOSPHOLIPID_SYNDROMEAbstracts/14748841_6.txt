 PROBLEM: A variety of reproductive impairments have been reported in the context of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS is associated with the presence of antibodies to negatively charged phospholipids that may affect the outcome of pregnancy. METHOD OF STUDY: Rat embryos were cultured within their yolk sacs. The effects of two antiphosphatidylserine monoclonal aPS antibodies (HL5B, RR7F) regarding their influence on growth and apoptotic events of the yolk sacs, as well as on growth and the morphology of the embryos, were studied. RESULTS: Exposure of rat embryos and their yolk sacs to aPS inhibited yolk sac growth. Moreover, increased number of apoptotic events of giant cells in the aPS-exposed ectoplacental cone was found in comparison with control IgG-exposed giant cells (P < 0.05). No significant damage was observed in the embryos. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that aPS affect growth and apoptosis of rat ectoplacental cone.
