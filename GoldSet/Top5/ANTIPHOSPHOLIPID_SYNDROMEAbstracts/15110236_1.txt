Recurrent pregnancy loss is a vexing problem facing many couples and doctors. Repetitive losses affect 2-5% of couples and specific causes are identified in only approximately 50% of patients. Many changes have occurred in this field over the past 20 years and the technology available for the workup of patients has improved.

In this regard, the identification of aPL as a new and treatable cause of recurrent abortion represents the major advance in the subject over the past 20 years.
