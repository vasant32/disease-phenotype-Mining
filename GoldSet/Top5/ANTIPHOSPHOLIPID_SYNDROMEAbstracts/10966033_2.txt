The antiphospholipid syndrome has been associated with many clinical conditions since its description by GRV Hughes in 1983. The linkage to Type 1 diabetes mellitus has not been established. There have been no reports of deep venous thrombosis in association with antiphospholipid syndrome and diabetes mellitus. We present the case of an African-American teenager with multiple miscarriages, diabetic ketoacidosis, deep venous thromboses, and elevated immunoglobulin M and G anticardiolipin antibodies. We urge that clinicians consider testing for antiphospholipid antibodies when diabetic patients present with multiple miscarriages or deep venous thrombosis.
