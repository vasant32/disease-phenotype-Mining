The antiphospholipid syndrome was initially described in 1986. To reassess the validity of antiphospholipid antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 95 patients with SLE were studied. Their antiphospholipid antibody profile was analysed and correlated with clinical findings such as thrombosis, abortions, or thrombocytopenia. A low prevalence of these antibodies was found (13 patients; 14%) with a high specificity for thrombosis (92%) and abortions (92%). The importance of anticardiolipin antibodies as a risk factor for thrombosis or abortions, or both, in patients with SLE is reaffirmed by this work.
