Primary antiphospholipid syndrome or PAPS is characterised by antiphospholipid antibodies and arterial and/or venous thromboses. Numerous other clinical features have been shown to be related to this syndrome. Chorea is a well known but rare phenomenon in systemic lupus erythematosus; it has been shown to be strongly related to the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. We describe two patients with chorea that appeared to be caused by the PAPS.
