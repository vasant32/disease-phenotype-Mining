PURPOSE: To evaluate the ocular involvement in patients with the primary antiphospholipid syndrome. METHODS: The authors performed a cross-sectional ophthalmologic study of 17 patients with the primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Retinal fluorangiography was performed in 13 patients. RESULTS: Visual symptoms were described by ten patients. Visual acuity was markedly decreased in five eyes. Conjunctival telangiectases and microaneurysms, in addition to single instances of bilateral episcleritis and limbal keratitis, were the anterior segment findings. Fundus abnormalities were present in 15 patients. Venous tortuosity was the most common finding but there were instances of optic disc edema, vitreous hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, vitreous bands, serous detachment of the macula, and retinal capillary abnormalities. Fluorangiography showed vaso-occlusive retinopathy in six eyes (5 patients, 29%). Choriocapillary vessel occlusion was observed in two eyes (1 patient) and binocular reticular degeneration of pigmentary epithelium was present in another case. CONCLUSION: The eye is frequently involved in the primary antiphospholipid syndrome, and serious ocular damage may occur. Detailed ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted in these patients.
