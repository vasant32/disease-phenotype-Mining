A case of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is presented, which manifested 5 years after onset of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). There were multiple collateral veins due to portal vein thrombosis. Because immunological abnormalities including anti-cardiolipin beta(2) glycoprotein-I antibody improved after surgical resection of BCC, it is likely that APS had occurred as a paraneoplastic syndrome with BCC. This case suggests that it is necessary to investigate the presence of APS when BCC is complicated by some coagulopathies.
