A 64-year-old woman with an 11-year history of systemic lupus erythematosus and amputation of her left lower leg as a consequence of arterial embolism, presented with two large, non-healing ulcers on her right shank. Pyoderma gangrenosum associated with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed based upon the typical clinical features and increased antibodies to cardiolipin. Although an aggressive therapy with corticosteroids and cyclosporine was started, her condition continued to worsen. She finally died as a result of sepsis. We discuss the difficulties in diagnosis and therapy of SLE combined with the antiphospholipid syndrome and pyoderma gangrenosum.
