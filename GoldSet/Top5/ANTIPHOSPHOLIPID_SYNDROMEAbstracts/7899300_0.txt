OBJECTIVES: Antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are widely associated with thrombosis, recurrent abortions and a thrombocytopenia. The purpose of this study was first to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in patients with SLE and secondly to establish the relationship between the findings and the presence of an antiphospholipid syndrome. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: First of all, a total of 52 consecutive patients with SLE and 52 healthy sex-and-age-matched control subjects were evaluated in a cross sectional study. All underwent M mode and two dimensional echocardiography, color flow imaging, pulsed and continuous wave Doppler. Secondly, in the SLE group, subjects exposed to antiphospholipid syndrome (n = 20) were compared to the control subjects. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, patients with SLE had significantly more pericardial abnormalities [(p = 0.0006) RR [3.36-infinity], mitral regurgitation [(p = 0.032) RR 2.48 [1.25-5.6]], tricuspid regurgitation [(p = 0.0016) RR 2.41 [1.58-8.85]. There was no significant difference between both groups for the left ventricular mass (p = 0.07), posterior wall (p = 0.25) and interventricular septum dimension (p = 0.16), and mitral valve thickness (p = 0.66). The antiphospholipid syndrome was significantly associated with increased left ventricular mass (p = 0.0054), posterior wall (p = 0.022) and interventricular septum dimension (p = 0.026). The relative risk increased for tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation in SLE patients who had the antiphospholipid syndrome. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy and right heart valvular regurgitation is significantly raised in SLE patients who have the antiphospholipid syndrome. However, antiphospholipid syndrome does not modify the prevalence of pericardial abnormalities which seems to be due to SLE alone.
