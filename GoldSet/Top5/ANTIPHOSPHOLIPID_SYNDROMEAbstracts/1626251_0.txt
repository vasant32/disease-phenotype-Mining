We report the case of a 74-year-old patient with HLA-B27 negative spondylarthropathy presenting with acute disseminated vascular occlusions. The presence of livedo reticularis prompted a search for antiphospholipid antibodies which were found to be markedly elevated. Histopathological examination revealed noninflammatory vascular obstruction. The clinical evolution was rapidly fatal in spite of corticosteroid treatment. Livedo reticularis can be an important diagnostic clue to various types of underlying disease. Increased levels of antiphospholipid antibodies have been associated with thrombosis and thromboembolism, especially in the context of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. This paper reports antiphospholipid antibody-associated noninflammatory vascular occlusions in a patient with HLA-B27 negative spondylarthropathy. The pathogenetic mechanism of antiphospholipid antibody-mediated vascular occlusions is not completely understood and optimal therapy remains to be defined.
