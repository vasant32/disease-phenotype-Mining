In the present study, anti-ribosomal P antibody in sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus was assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and its association with clinical symptoms of the patients was analyzed. The presence of anti-ribosomal P antibody was associated with increased frequency of lupus nephritis in the presence of anti-DNA antibody, and was associated with increased frequency of vascular thrombosis in the presence of anti-beta2 glycoprotein I antibody and/or lupus anticoagulant. The level of anti-ribosomal P antibody correlated inversely with the peripheral lymphocyte counts.
