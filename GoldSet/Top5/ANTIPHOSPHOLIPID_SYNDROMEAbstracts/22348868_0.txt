A Chinese woman had a first-episode of psychosis in the second trimester of pregnancy. The sudden onset of psychotic symptoms and fluctuating mental condition with visual hallucinations suggested an organic origin for the psychosis. Antipsychotic medication was started. Ultrasound investigation at 19 weeks of gestation revealed intrauterine growth retardation and she decided to terminate the pregnancy. Positive blood test results for antiphospholipid antibodies confirmed a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus with antiphospholipid syndrome. Psychosis is one of the neuropsychiatric syndromes in systemic lupus erythematosus and can sometimes be the primary manifestation, antedating other evidence of the disease. Pregnancy can exacerbate systemic lupus erythematosus. This report highlights the importance of considering an organic cause for psychosis, including systemic lupus erythematosus, especially when it occurs for the first time during pregnancy in a previously healthy woman.
