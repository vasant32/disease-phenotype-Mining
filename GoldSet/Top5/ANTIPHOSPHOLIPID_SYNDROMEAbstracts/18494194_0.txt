The aim of this study was to present our diagnostic and therapeutic experience with antiphospholipide syndrome (APS) and vascular thrombosis. Ninety-nine patients with positive antiphospholipide antibodies (aPL) and vascular thrombosis were included in the study: forty patients, according to clinical classification criteria, had primary antiphospholipide syndrome (PAPS), and fifty-nine patients had secondary antiphospholipide syndrome (SAPS). In PAPS group, 82.5% of the patients were LA-positive, 37.5% of the patients were IgG aCL-positive, 27.5% of the patients were IgM aCL-positive, and 15% of the patients were IgG antibeta2GPI-positive. In SAPS group, 61% of the patients were LA-positive, 50.8% of the patients were IgG aCL-positive, and 47.5% of the patients were IgM aCL-positive. Administered therapy was low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) throughout 7 days, followed by warfarin with prothrombin time maintained between 2.0 and 3.0 INR.
