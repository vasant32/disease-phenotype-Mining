We describe a 22-year-old woman with renovascular hypertension, stroke, and left renal infarction. She had markedly elevated antiphospholipid antibodies without evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus, other autoimmune or rheumatic disorders. Selective renal angiogram revealed lack of perfusion to the lower pole of left kidney and her left renal vein renin level was elevated. She represents an example of primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome resulting in renal infarction and hypertension.
