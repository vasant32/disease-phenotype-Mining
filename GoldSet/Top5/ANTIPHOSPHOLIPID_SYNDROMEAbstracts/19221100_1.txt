The objective of our study was to evaluate the significance of extended antiphospholipid profile in patients with venous thromboembolism without any systemic autoimmune disease. In 140 patients (age 18-69 years; 47.1% men) with venous thromboembolism and 136 control participants we tested anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I (anti-beta2-GPI) and also non-criteria antiphospholipid antibodies: antiphosphatidic acid, antiphosphatidylethanolamine, antiphosphatidylglycerol, antiphosphatidylinositol, antiphosphatidylserine. Commercial and in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used. The antibodies with significantly higher prevalence in patients (compared to controls) were: immunoglobulin (Ig) M-anticardiolipin antibodies (12.9%; P = 0.035), IgG-anti-beta2-GPI (16.4%; P = 0.0032), IgM-antiphosphatidylethanolamine (14.3%; P = 0.014). In most cases, these three antibodies did not overlap. In conclusion, of non-criteria antiphospholipid antibodies, only antiphosphatidylethanolamine were significantly more prevalent in patients with venous thromboembolism, with only minor overlapping with the criteria antiphospholipid antibodies. Our results suggest the possible utility of searching for antiphosphatidylethanolamine in the clinical suspicion of antiphospholipid syndrome and the absence of criteria antiphospholipid antibodies.
