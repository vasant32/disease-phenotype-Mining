The antiphospholipid syndrome has rarely been described in patients with autoimmune hepatitis. Two cases with type I autoimmune hepatitis and antiphospholipid syndrome are presented. The first case is that of a 53-year-old Caucasian female with a history of arterial thrombosis and fetal loss who was submitted to clinical and laboratory testing due to persistent transaminasaemia and was found to have autoimmune hepatitis. Antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant) were positive. The second case is that of a 31-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who was submitted to laboratory testing due to a second-trimester fetal death, revealing an increased activated partial thromboplastin time and positive antiphospholipid antibodies. In conclusion, secondary antiphospholipid syndrome may accompany autoimmune hepatitis.
