Obstetric complications such as fetal death, premature delivery, preeclampsia and recurrent abortions (since chromosomal or anatomic defects have been excluded) are characteristic manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). They can occur in patients with known APS with previous arterial or venous events in any tissue or organ, or be its first and only manifestation. Pregnancy in a patient with APS is considered high risk and the full prenatal clinical follow-up must be carried with this in mind, eliminating or minimizing concomitant thrombotic risk factors.
