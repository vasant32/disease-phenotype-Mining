Incidence of arterial hypertension (AH), its relation with activity of lupus nephritis (LN), other factors (antiphospholipid syndrome, old age, disturbances of purin and lipid metabolism), prognostic implication of AH were studied in a trial performed from 1957 to 1996. A total of 398 patients with LN were divided into 3 groups according to immunosuppressive therapy practiced in different time periods. Overall AH incidence and that of severe AH were similar at present and in the past. AH occurred frequently in patients with rapidly progressing LN and active LN with nephrotic syndrome. In remission of nephrotic syndrome AH incidence was on the decrease. This suggests that hypertension may be a criterion of LN activity. AH was also associated with the presence of antiphospholipid syndrome and old age. AH was a separate prognostic indicator in respect to overall and renal survival. Hemodynamic mechanisms may contribute to LN progression.
