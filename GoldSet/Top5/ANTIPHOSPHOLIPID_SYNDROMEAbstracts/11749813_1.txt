AIM: To explore the therapeutic effect and the mechanism of Chinese herbs on antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) by observing the effect of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge injectio (SmBI) on anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) induced by beta2 glycoprotein I (beta2-GP I). METHODS: Sixty female mice randomly fell into 6 groups: group A, B, C, D was injected through abdominal cavity with different dosage of SmBI daily; after 14 d, group A, B, C, E was immunized with 150 microg of purified human beta2-GP I in complete Freund's adjuvant subcutaneously; group F as control. The titre of aCL were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; subsets of T cell were grouped by streptavidin-biotin complex technique; and the activity of IL-2 was measured by MTT chromatometry. RESULTS: (1) Compared with group E, the absorbance (A) of aCL in group A, B, and C was decreased (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). By linear correlation, the dosage is negatively correlated with the A values of aCL in 1, 2, and 3 weeks (P < 0.01). (2) Compared with group E, TH/TS ratio was reduced in group A, B, and C (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01); there is no significant differences between group D and F (P>0.05). By linear correlation, the dosage is negatively correlated with TH/TS ratio (P < 0.01). (3) Compared with E, the activity of IL-2 in group B and C decreased significantly (P < 0.01). By linear correlation, there is negative correlation between dosage and IL-2 activity (P < 0.01). There is no significant difference between D and F (P > 0.05). (4) There is positive correlation between TH/TS ratio and IL-2 activity in different dilutions (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The mechanism of suppressive effect of SmBI on aCL induced by beta2-GP I may be realized by resuming the elevated TH/TS ratio and IL-2 activity. The state that SmBI have no effect on normal mice indicates that SmBI has selective immunoregulative functive.
