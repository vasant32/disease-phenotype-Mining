Antiphospholipid syndrome patients with recurrent miscarriage have an impairment in fibrinolysis demonstrated by prolonged clot lysis time (CLT) that cannot be attributed to differences in thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) antigen levels. Patients with unexplained recurrent miscarriage have an impairment in fibrinolysis demonstrated by increased CLT, that can be at least partly explained by higher TAFI antigen levels.
