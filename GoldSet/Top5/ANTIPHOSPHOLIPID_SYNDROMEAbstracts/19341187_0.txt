Antiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder characterized by recurrent venous or arterial thrombosis and/or recurrent abortions associated with persistently elevated levels of antiphospholipid antibodies. In some patients antiphospholipid syndrome occurs in association with systemic lupus erythematosus, or other autoimmune disorders or malignancies. Antiphospholipid syndrome can be induced by certain drugs. A correct diagnosis of this disease is necessary as it is potentially associated with serious and sometimes life-threatening complications. Clinical presentations of antiphospholipid syndrome may vary widely even in the same patient. The time between individual manifestations of the disease also varies considerably. Therefore its early detection requires a strong index of suspicion especially when thrombosis occurs at unusual sites or non-specific symptoms predominate in the clinical presentation. We report a case of a 20-year-old woman with a recent history of pulmonary embolism who was admitted to the hospital because of severe symptomatic anemia. Once the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome coexisting with systemic lupus erythematosus as a primary disorder has been established, implemention of specific treatment resulted in markedly improved condition.
