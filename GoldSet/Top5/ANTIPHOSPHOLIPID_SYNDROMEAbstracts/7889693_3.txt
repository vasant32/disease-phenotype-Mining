Results of immunological studies on skin biopsies of 5 patients with Sneddon's syndrome are reported. Also studied were coagulation factors and autoantibodies believed to play a role in this syndrome. Hemostasis was normal except for a mild increase of fibrinogen in one subject; lupus anticoagulant (LAC) and anticardiolipin antibodies were negative in all. The skin biopsies ruled out systemic vasculitis and vasculitis in association with connective tissue diseases. Sneddon's syndrome is a peculiar clinicopathological condition, probably with several etiologies, but is distinct from primary antiphospholipid syndrome.
