We present a case with diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis that illustrates the appearance of this rare chronic lung disease on conventional chest X-ray, high-resolution CT, and transbronchial lung biopsy. This is the first case reported which developed pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis after Varicella zoster infection in a patient with antiphospholipid antibodies and discoid lupus.
