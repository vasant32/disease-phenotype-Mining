Acute cerebral ischemia resulting from the occlusion of a large or medium size intracranial artery is a known complication of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (AAS). Usually these patients are treated by low dose aspirin and anticoagulants to prevent a stroke. We are reporting a case of acute stroke in a patient with AAS in whom combined intravenous and intraarterial thrombolytics were used emergently with an excellent outcome. A 32-year-old woman presented with a left hemispheric stroke of 2.5 hours duration. A computed tomography (CT) study of the brain was normal. The patient was treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator but remained aphasic and hemiplegic. Subsequently, the patient had a stable xenon CT cerebral blood flow study demonstrating low flow in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory and an angiogram, which demonstrated occlusion of the left MCA. The patient was then treated with intraarterial urokinase with a rapid and marked improvement in her neurological deficit. The case suggests that stroke patients can be treated safely and effectively with combined thrombolytics.
