A 39-years-old woman was admitted to our hospital with musculoskeletal complaints (myalgias and symmetric arthralgias in proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal joints of the hands and in knees), systemic symptoms like fever, fatigue, malaise and a six months previous history of a transient ischemic attack. The presence of antibodies to double-stranded deoxyribonucleic-acid (DNA) and antiphospholipid antibodies led to the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. Cerebral infarction develops significantly more often in patients with lupus and antiphospholipid antibodies, but other clinical syndromes are associated with lupus anticoagulant: cognitive dysfunction, seizures, polyneuropathy, aseptic meningitis, myelopathy.
