 BACKGROUND: In this study, we used an endogenous thrombin potential (ETP)-based assay to examine the response to activated protein C (APC) during early puerperium of 6 Japanese patients of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) without a history of familial thrombophilia or antiphospholipid syndrome. METHODS: The patient group comprised 6 Japanese women diagnosed for DVT or PE at Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, between July 1997 and April 2000. The control group comprised 30 healthy Japanese women in early puerperium. APC-sensitivity ratio (APC-sr), complete blood count (CBC), and other coagulant variables (thrombin-antithrombin-complex (TAT) and fibrin/fibrinogen-degration product (FDP)-D-dimer levels) were determined. RESULTS: Mean APC-sr was 2.0 +/- 0.3 in the control group and significantly higher (3.3 +/- 1.0) in the patient group (P < 0.05). The FDP-D-dimer level was significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group, but there was no significant difference in the TAT complex level. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that sensitivity to APC is reduced in patients with DVT or PE during early puerperium. Although further clinical studies are needed to confirm, it appears that sensitivity to APC detected by ETP-based assay could become a useful marker to estimate the occurrence of DVT or PE.
