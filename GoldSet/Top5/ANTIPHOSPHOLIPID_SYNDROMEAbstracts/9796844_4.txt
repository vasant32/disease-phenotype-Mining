The present study describes the clinical characteristics of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), from the rheumatology service of the two main teaching hospitals in Kuwait. It was a retrospective-cum-prospective clinical study of 108 SLE patients. There were 98 females and 10 males, with a median age of 31.5y. Kuwaitis constituted 69%, while 31% were expatriates. The mean disease duration was 62 months. The main clinical features were: musculoskeletal involvement (87%), photosensitivity (48%), malar rash (43%), discoid lesions (10%), oral ulcers (33%), vasculitic skin lesions (10%), haematological features (53%), constitutional symptoms (51.4%), neuropsychiatric manifestations (23%), renal involvement (37%), serositis (29%), clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome (21%), cardiac involvement (10%) and pulmonary manifestations (19%). In conclusion, the clinical features of SLE in Kuwait were similar to most major studies from developed countries. Main differences included prominent haematological and mucocutaneous manifestations and possibly a low prevalence of anti-Sm antibodies. Whether these differences are due to the environment or genetic factors, remains to be studied.
