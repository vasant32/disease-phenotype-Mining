Primary antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by venous and arterial thrombosis, fetal loss, or thrombocytopenia in association with antiphospholipid antibodies and no associated disease process. The authors report a case of lower extremity thrombosis in a 12 year old who had primary antiphospholipid syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first report of peripheral arterial thrombosis in primary antiphospholipid syndrome in the pediatric population.
