Chronic pulmonary thromboembolism is known to be associated with poor prognosis with conservative medical treatment. Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy for chronic pulmonary thromboembolic disease is a potentially lifesaving procedure that prevents right-sided cardiac failure as a result of secondary pulmonary hypertension caused by pulmonary thromboembolism. We report a rare case of systemic lupus erythematosus with antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient who presented with pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic proximal multiple pulmonary thromboembolism. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of chronic pulmonary thromboembolism complicated by systemic lupus erythematosus with antiphospholipid syndrome. Thromboendarterectomy was performed with satisfactory results.
