BACKGROUND: The antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome (APS) is a thrombophilic disorder, in which venous and arterial thrombosis can occur. We report the rare case of a patient with mesenteric infarction due to primary APS. CASE REPORT: A 46-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital because of severe abdominal pain. A laparotomy was performed and revealed infarction of a jejunal loop which was resected. At pathohistological examination mesenteric artery infarction was found. Preoperatively prolonged partial thromboplastin time led to coagulation analysis. Lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were found. TREATMENT: The diagnosis of primary APS was made and the patient was treated with aspirin (100 mg/day) and low molecular weight heparin (2,500 IE/day) permanently. Eighteen months after mesenteric infarction the patient is free of further thromboembolic events.
