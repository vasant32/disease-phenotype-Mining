OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) recurrence in young people, and its association with some genetic polymorphisms (FV G1691A, FII G20210A, MTHFR C677T, PAI-1 4G/5G). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: A database was established prospectively to follow-up a cohort of unselected patients who had had a first episode of objectively proven DVT under the age of 40 years. All patients had DNA analysis for heritable thrombophilia. We excluded patients with deficiency of antithrombin, protein C or protein S, malignant disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, or a requirement for long-term antithrombotic treatment. The end-point was objective evidence of symptomatic DVT recurrence. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were enrolled in the study. Mean duration of follow-up was 4.07 years. At 2 years, the cumulative recurrence rate was 19.3%. The risk of risk was not related to presence or absence of laboratory evidence of genetic polymorphisms: FV G1619A (HR 1.26 [95%CI: 0.64-2.46]; p = 0.51), FII G20210A (HR 0.81 [95%CI: 0.35-1.89]; p = 0.62), MTHFR C677T (HR 1.26 [95%CI: 0.56-2.81]; p = 0.58), PAI-1 4G/5G (0.84 [95%CI: 0.35-2.05]; p = 0.71). CONCLUSION: In this study, the risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis in young people was not related with the presence of FV G1691A, FII G20210A, MTHFR C677T or PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms.
