Portal vein thrombosis, except in hepatocellular carcinoma and severe cirrhosis, is due to one or several prothrombotic disorders with or without a local precipitating factor. We report a case of a portal and splenic vein thrombosis, without cavernoma and varices which occurred in a 72-year-old man with abdominal pain and weakness. Three prothrombotic states including latent myeloproliferative disorder, antiphospholipid syndrome, and factor II G202101 mutation, were observed. Anticoagulant treatment resulted in complete repermeation of the portal and splenic veins without a hemorrhagic event. This illustrates that several prothrombotic states may occur in a single patient with portal vein thrombosis. Early anticoagulant therapy, in recent portal vein thrombosis, can result in repermeation.
