We describe a patient with the lupus anti-coagulant who had recurrent episodes, over a 2 year period, of a severe and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. This patient also had positive serological assays for syphilis and anti-cardiolipin antibodies. Associated with the coagulopathy were co-expressed episodes of liver disease, ultimately terminating in fulminant liver failure. At autopsy the features were characteristic of the Budd-Chiari syndrome. This is the first report to document how consumptive coagulopathy may present as a dominant feature of the anti-phospholipid syndrome. It also clearly describes an immune mediated thrombotic mechanism as a cause of hepatic veno-occlusive disorders. Furthermore, this case highlights the varied clinical spectrum of the anti-phospholipid syndrome and suggests that a high index of suspicion is required to ensure its diagnosis.
