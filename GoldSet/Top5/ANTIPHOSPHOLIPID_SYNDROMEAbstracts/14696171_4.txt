Very little is known about any interaction between patent foramen ovale (PFO) and various hypercoagulable disorders that have been associated with cryptogenic stroke. Percutaneous PFO closure for secondary prevention of paradoxical thromboembolization is receiving increasing attention. Hypercoagulability may affect the potential risks and expected benefits of percutaneous PFO closure. Consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous PFO closure at a single center were screened for the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, elevated lipoprotein(a), hyperhomocysteinemia, and dysfibrinogenemia. Sixteen of 34 patients (47%) with complete arterial hypercoagulability screening had laboratory evidence of arterial hypercoagulability. Thirteen of these patients (38%) had antiphospholipid antibodies. Antiphospholipid antibodies appear to be common in patients referred for percutaneous PFO closure for secondary prevention of systemic thromboembolic events. Thorough testing based on established recommendations is warranted. Further studies are needed regarding the interaction between PFO and various hypercoagulable disorders that have been associated with cryptogenic stroke.
