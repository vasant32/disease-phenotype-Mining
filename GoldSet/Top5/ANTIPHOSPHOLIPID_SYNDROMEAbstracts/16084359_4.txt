Hyponatremia is a commonly encountered clinical problem with potentially severe complications. Among the underlying implicated etiologies are medications such as oxcarbazepine, which has been well documented and attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormones (SIADH). We report the case of a 28-year-old woman with a diagnosis of secondary antiphospholipid syndrome who presented with asymptomatic hyponatremia secondary to excessive water intake after oxcarbazepine ingestion, suggesting a new mechanism for oxcarbazepine-induced hyponatremia.
