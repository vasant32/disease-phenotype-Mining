Echocardiographic studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of valvular disease in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS). However, there are no studies assessing changes over time in valvular abnormalities. We conducted a study to determine whether there are changes over time in valvular lesions as detected by serial transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Twelve patients with a first TEE had a second evaluation after a mean period of 13.5 months. There were 10 women and two men with a mean age of 38 years. Two patients had normal TEE on both initial and follow-up studies. Ten patients (83%) had valvular abnormalities, predominantly of the mitral and aortic valves in both studies. Abnormalities consisted of thickening, nodules, regurgitation, regurgitation and stenosis, and calcification. The type and frequency of lesions changed over time. As an example, one mitral valve nodule disappeared on follow up but three new aortic nodules developed even though all patients were receiving anticoagulant therapy. Two patients with mitral and aortic nodules presented cerebral ischemia. Mitral valvuloplasty was performed in one case. These results show that valvular abnormalities in patients with PAPS resolve, appear, or persist irrespective of anticoagulant therapy. Regurgitation is often mild or moderate, but stenosis may appear.
