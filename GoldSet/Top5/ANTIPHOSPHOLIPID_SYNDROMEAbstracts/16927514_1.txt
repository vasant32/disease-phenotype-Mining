A 46-year-old white male diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) was seen for audiological testing 15 minutes following a sudden onset hearing loss in the right ear. The test battery included pure-tone audiometry, word-recognition testing, speech-recognition threshold (SRT) testing, immittance testing, and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) testing. Testing revealed a sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear. Shortly after testing, the patient indicated that his condition had improved. Testing was repeated, and the second round of tests revealed normal hearing in both ears. Four days later, a follow-up test again indicated normal hearing in both ears. Possible connections of this brief occurrence of idiopathic hearing loss with the patient's medical conditions are discussed. Specifically, symptoms were consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) affecting his right cochlea in the stria vascularis region, resulting in a temporary, sensorineural hearing loss. No residual effects were observed clinically.
