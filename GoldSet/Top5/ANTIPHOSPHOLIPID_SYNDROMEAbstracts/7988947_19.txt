The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of elevated antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) in a large series of patients admitted to a department of Internal Medicine. At the end of entry phase, 1014 patients were tested (488 males-526 females, mean age: 66.7 years, range 18-97). Seventy-two (7.1%) patients were found APA positive at least once: 44 males and 28 females, mean age 69 years, range 23 to 94. Twenty fulfilled the criteria of Primary Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome: 10 patients were referred for deep vein thrombosis, 3 had history of deep vein thrombosis, 1 had both arterial thrombosis and a history of venous thrombosis; 2 had thrombocytopenia; 3 had stroke, 1 had a history of a stroke. One patient had SLE according to ARA classification. The most frequent associated disease was cancer: 14 patients, 9 had evolutive malignant disease, 5 were in clinical remission of neoplasia. Other clinical conditions included chronic and/or acute alcoholic intoxication (n = 8), severe atherosclerosis (n = 4), leg ulcer (n = 4). Insufficient data are available about the evolution, but 7 patients died in the year following diagnosis. Eight patients had fluctuations in APA detection: 2 initially APA positive became negative, 5 initially negative became positive and 1 patient was alternatively positive, negative and positive without steroid treatment. Thus, as expected, APA occur in a variety of clinical disorders. The association with cancer or alcoholic intoxication deserves further investigations.
