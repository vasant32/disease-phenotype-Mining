This study of 49 patients with spontaneous venous and arterial thrombosis identified 27 with hypercoagulable states: 13 had only venous thrombosis (VT), six had episodes of VT followed by arterial thrombosis (AT) and eight had AT only. All 27 patients were less than 42 years of age; 22 had specific natural anticoagulant or fibrinolytic deficiencies: antithrombin III (nine patients), protein C (eight patients), protein S (three patients), heparin cofactor II (two patients), tissue plasminogen activator release (one patient) and mixed antithrombin III and protein S (one patient). The remaining five patients had recurrent thrombotic events associated with resistance to heparin anticoagulation, but no established laboratory diagnosis. Clotting complications included recurrent VT, pulmonary embolism, multiple failed arterial procedures and lower extremity amputation. The remaining 22 patients (mean age of 53 years, range of 46 to 63 years), 12 with VT and ten with AT, did not have laboratory evidence of hypercoagulability and none had recurrent vascular occlusions. All these patients were successfully treated by conventional therapy without any additional thrombotic events during the follow-up period. Young adults with spontaneous thrombotic events should be screened for possible hypercoagulable states. Additionally, these young patients need further evaluation and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors. Those with premature atherosclerosis have an especially poor prognosis despite surgical intervention and anticoagulant therapy.
