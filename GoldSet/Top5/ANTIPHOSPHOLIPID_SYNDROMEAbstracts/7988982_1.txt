To investigate the crossreactivity of anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aCL) with glycolipids and endothelial cells, we used (1) culture supernatants derived from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed peripheral lymphocytes of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) complicated by antiphospholipid syndrome, and also (2) sera from patients with SLE. The results obtained from culture supernatants demonstrated that aCL crossreacts with myelin-derived acidic glycolipid sulfatide, bacterial endotoxin glycolipid lipid A and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The results obtained from sera showed a significant correlation between levels of aCL and anti-sulfatide antibody, and between levels of aCL and anti-HUVEC antibody. These findings indicate that aCL can bind to the myelin sheath and HUVEC, which may have implications for the pathogenic potential of aCL for nervous system involvement and thrombotic complications.
