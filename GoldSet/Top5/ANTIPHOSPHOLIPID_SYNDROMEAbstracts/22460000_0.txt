 OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychiatric symptoms may be the main manifestations and very early symptoms of developing autoimmune diseases. Early detection and treatment could reverse psychotic symptoms and restore cognitive function. CASE REPORT: A 24-year-old woman presented with acute psychotic symptoms. Routine physical examinations revealed only mild fever. Due to positive antiphospholipid antibodies, low protein S with elevated d-dimer and brain hypoperfusion, early-phase antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) was suspected. Early immunomodulation treatment led to complete remission of the psychotic symptoms, preservation of cognitive function and prevention of APS progression. CONCLUSION: Since early detection and treatment can reverse the progression of autoimmune diseases with central nervous system involvement, these should be highlighted when managing high-risk patients.
