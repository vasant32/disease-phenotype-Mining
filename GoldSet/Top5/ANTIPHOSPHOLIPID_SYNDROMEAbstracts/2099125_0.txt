The recently described antiphospholipid antibodies syndrome (APA) is recognized because recurrent abortion, thrombocytopenia and repeated arterial and/or, venous thrombosis plus the demonstration of serum antibodies reactive with anionic phospholipids. We studied 51 patients who attend the anticoagulation clinic at our Institute. In a representative sample, we search for serum IgG specific for cardiolipin using an standard assay. We did not pick up unrecognized APA cases. The low frequency of this condition could be an explanation for our negative results in non-selected cases. Besides, this study denies a relationship between the chronic use of coumarin anticoagulants and development of peculiar antibodies.
