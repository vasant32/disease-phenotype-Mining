The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is characterized by venous and/or arterial thrombosis, repeated miscarriages and the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies and/or a circulating lupus anticoagulant. Antibodies directed against phospholipids constitute a family of immunoglobulins with different specificities. The mechanism through which lesions are induced by these antibodies has not yet been fully determined. Treatment includes immunosuppressive measures and prevention of recurrent thrombosis.
