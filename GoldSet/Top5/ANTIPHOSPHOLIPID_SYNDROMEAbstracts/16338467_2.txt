Studies suggest that preeclampsia (PE) originates in the placenta and is associated with deficient trophoblast invasion of spiral arteries. The direct cause remains unknown, but preeclampsia is often associated with circulating factors that can induce generalized endothelial dysfunction. Antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) in circulation are also associated with vascular diseases. Although the quantification of APA is not currently used as a prognostic of the risk of PE, studies suggest that thrombophilias play a role in PE pathogenesis. In fact, the pathology of placentae from PE and Antiphospholipid syndrome patients is similar; atherosis, thrombosis and infarction, and endothelium activation represent the pathological mechanisms. We identified a new antibody which recognizes non-bilayer phospholipid arrangements (NPA) in membrane models and in cell membranes in vivo, and which triggered an autoimmune-like disease in mice. We evaluated the presence of NPA in the placentae and in sera, and whether NPA induced NPA antibodies in patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). Results showed increased levels of NPA in the syncytiotrophoblast, extravillous cytotrophoblast, syncytial knots and the amnion epithelial cell membranes of the placenta, as well as increases in NPA and NPA antibodies in sera from HDP patients, when compared with controls. This suggests that NPA derived from placenta could be one of multiple factors associated with pregnancy pathologies.
