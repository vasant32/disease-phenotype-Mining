Antiphospholipid antibodies (APA), including lupus anticoagulants (LAC; as detected by in vitro blood clotting tests) and anti-cardiolipin antibodies (ACA; as assayed by solid-phase immunoassay), are strongly associated with recurrent thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent fetal loss in some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The combined presence of APA and these clinical manifestations is termed antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). LAC and ACA comprise heterogeneous and somewhat overlapping autoantibody subsets. To date, it is unclear what degree of heterogeneity is present in an individual patient and between patients. To begin to address these issues, we generated three monoclonal LAC antibodies from a patient with SLE and APS. These antibodies were studied for their binding specificities and variable (V) region nucleotide sequences. All three LAC were unreactive with DNA, cardiolipin or other phospholipids. Sequence analysis of these antibodies revealed extensive overlap in their Ig V genes with anti-DNA antibodies and other autoantibodies characteristic of lupus. These data provide the first V gene sequence information on a group of SLE-derived LAC without ACA activity, representative of a similar subset of LAC found in patients with APS.
