A 43-year-old male with recurrent cerebral infarctions and high titers of antiphospholipid antibodies was found to have a thrombus in his left ventricular outflow tract by transthoracic echocardiography. This thrombus disappeared after less than 24 hours of intravenous heparin therapy due to resolution or asymptomatic embolism. Left ventricular thrombi in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and rapid disappearance of left ventricular thrombi with heparin therapy are infrequently reported occurrences.
