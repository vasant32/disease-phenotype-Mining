beta(2)-Glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI) appears to be the major antigen for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). In early infancy, virtually all children initiate transient immune response to non-pathogenic nutritional antigens, which fails to terminate in children with atopic diseases. To examine the possibility that a prolonged immune response to beta(2)GPI could also spread to the human protein, antibodies against human beta(2)GPI (anti-beta(2)GPI) were determined in 93 randomly selected children with different allergic diseases. A high frequency (42%) of IgG anti-beta(2)GPI was found in children with atopic dermatitis (AD), but not in those with other allergic diseases. Anti-beta(2)GPI in children with AD were exclusively of the IgG1 subclass and bound to bovine beta(2)GPI as well, but not to either beta(2)GPI combined with the phospholipid cardiolipin. The epitopes were identified in domain V of beta(2)GPI and the antibody binding was abolished upon the specific proteolytic cleavage of the phospholipid-binding C-terminal loop in domain V of beta(2)GPI. These results indicated that the epitopes for anti-beta(2)GPI in children with AD most likely resided in close vicinity of the phospholipid-binding site of beta(2)GPI. The epitopic difference from anti-beta(2)GPI in APS may explain presumed non-thrombogenicity of anti-beta(2)GPI in children with AD.
