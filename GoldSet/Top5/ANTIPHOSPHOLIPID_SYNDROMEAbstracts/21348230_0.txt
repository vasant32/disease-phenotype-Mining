 BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown origins. We report a case of SLE retinopathy concurrent with macular edema and ischemic optic neuropathy. CASE: A 30-year-old women with SLE presented with sudden visual disturbances and SLE retinopathy with typical macular edema. We treated her with subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide injections which providing a resolution of the edema within a few days, but her visual acuity did not improve. Scotoma, relative afferent papillary defect (RAPD) and optic nerve abnormality appeared on MRI during her clinical course. A diagnosis of hidden ischemic optic neuropathy was established. She was treated with corticosteroid pulse therapy and because of an antiphospholipid syndrome, antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy were used to improve ocular circulation. Following therapy, her visual function recovered. CONCLUSION: Although the symptoms seemed complicated, circulatory insufficiency was the main cause of the complications and its improvement provided the key to the patient's recovery.
