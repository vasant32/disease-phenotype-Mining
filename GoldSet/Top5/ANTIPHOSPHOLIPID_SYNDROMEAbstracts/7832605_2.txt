The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome has numerous cardiac manifestations, including valvular thickening, insufficiency, and mass lesions. The mass lesions may be confused with atrial myxomas and other vegetations, sometimes necessitating a surgical diagnosis. There are no prospective studies on treatment or follow-up of intracardiac lesions in antiphospholipid antibody  syndrome. We prospectively followed up three patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome for intracardiac lesions (one atrial and two mitral valve masses) complicated by systemic embolization. Anticoagulation led to complete resolution of the masses in 6 weeks to 3 months. We propose that initial treatment of an intracardiac lesion in patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome should be a trial of systemic anticoagulation before surgical intervention.
