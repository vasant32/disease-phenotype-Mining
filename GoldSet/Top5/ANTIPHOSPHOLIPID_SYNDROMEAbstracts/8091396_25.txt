High levels of IgG antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) have been associated with clinical thrombosis. It is uncertain however whether these antibodies play a direct role in thrombosis or are merely epiphenomena. To investigate whether antiphospholipid antibodies might play a role in thrombosis, we utilized a novel mouse model in which the dynamics of in vivo thrombosis can be studied. CD1 mice (26-30 g) were passively immunized with 25 mg of human IgG from a patient with the Antiphospholipid Syndrome (IgG-APS) (n = 17), IgG from normal pooled sera (IgG-NHS) (n = 9), or saline solution (n = 12), followed by 40 mg of the same preparations at 48 h. At 72 h, levels of human aPL antibodies, detected using the anticardiolipin ELISA test (aCL ELISA test), in mice immunized with IgG-APS, were 50-100 GPL units. Each animal was anesthetized, femoral vein minimally mobilized and subjected to a standardized "pinch" injury to induce thrombosis. The vessel was transilluminated using acrylic optical fibers connected to a light source, and clot formation and dissolution were visualized by a standard surgical microscope equipped with a video camera, video recorder, and computer assisted analysis system. Results showed that average clot size was significantly larger in mice immunized with IgG-APS compared to those treated with saline (p < 0.037). In addition, the thrombus persisted longer in a significantly higher number of mice immunized with IgG-APS (10/17) compared to mice immunized with IgG-NHS (1/9) or saline (2/12) (p < 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
