Following an accidental finding of a large atrial lead-related thrombus in a 33-year-old woman with suspected prothrombotic disorder, a conservative treatment with low molecular weight heparin injections and close transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring was used. It led to a complete resolution of the thrombus in 4 weeks without the need for a high-risk operation in this patient.
