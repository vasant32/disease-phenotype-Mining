According to the recent data, the determination of the higher titer of antibodies to beta2-glycoprotein-I (beta2-GP-I) that is included in a complex compound with negative phospholipid membranes determinates the thrombogenicity in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). To specify this regularity, the authors examined 86 patients with primary APS and 20 patients with venous and arterial thrombosis without APS. With increased beta2-GP-I antibody levels, the incidence of thrombotic events was established to w significantly higher than in APS without the increased titer of beta2-GP-I antibodies. In primary APS-associated persistent miscarriage, the increased titer of beta2-GP-I is much more infrequently encountered.
