Thromboembolic complications during pregnancy are the most common causes of maternal death. Here we report on thromboembolic prophylaxis of 60 pregnancies of 32 pregnant women with familial thrombophilia. Long-term Fraxiparine (Sanofi-Chinoin) as thromboprophylaxis was applied in 26 cases throughout pregnancy. UFH (Heparin-Ca inj.) was used in 11 cases, and there were 23 pregnancies without thromboembolic prophylaxis in our patient's case histories. Artificial abortions were not included in this paper. The ratio of successful pregnancies were: with Fraxiparine: 24/26 (92.3%), with UFH (Heparin-Ca): 8/11 (72.7%), without prophylaxis: 4/23 (17.4%). In the patient group treated with Fraxiparine there were no foetopathy, thrombocytopenia or bleeding complication. LMWH is recommended for pregnant women with familial thrombophilia. According to literature data and our own experiences the doses of LMWH in patients with familial thrombophilia, and -antiphospholipid syndrome, and -artificial heart value are suggested.
