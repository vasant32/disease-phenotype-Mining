To assess the relation between immunological disorders and recurrent abortion, 15 pregnant women with previous unexplained recurrent abortivity were submitted to serum screening for antiphospholyeid antibodies syndrome (APA) syndrome. The screening included specific tests for autoimmune diseases (ANA, specific organ antibodies, immune complexes research, etc.), the immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA) for the research of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and the determination of the kaolin coagulation time (KCT) through Exener method for lupus anticoagulant (LAC). Nine gravids out of 15 were positive both to LAC and ACA antibodies, two gravids were positive to only ACA antibodies, while four had no antibody reaction. Therefore, whatever the effective mechanism is, it seems ascertained that several cases of unexplained recurrent abortion are related to APA syndrome. Nowadays the above-mentioned syndrome is successfully treated using corticosteroid immunosuppressors and platelet antiaggregators which reduce autoimmune reaction and thrombotic episodes.
