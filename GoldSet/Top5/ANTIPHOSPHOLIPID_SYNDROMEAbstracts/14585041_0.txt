Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is defined by the presence of arterial and venous thromboses, recurrent fetal death, cerebrovascular accidents, hemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and various other manifestations in different organs. APS is a clinical entity that can appear commonly alongside systemic lupus erithemathous on it can occur as a primary disease. The syndrome is defined by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in serum, a group of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA or an mixture of them) that adopt an hexagonal configuration when they are incubated at 37grades C. In APS, it is rather common to find cardiac lesions such as non-verrucous endocarditis, valvular lesions (especially of the mitral valve), microvascular cardiac disease and more risk of thrombosis at this level, myxomas that could be the cause of a systemic inflammation in relation to the production of antiphospholipid antibodies, intracardiac thrombii and congenital heart disease. We present the case of a woman with APS associated with interauricular communication whose initial diagnosis were pulmonary thromboembolism and cerebrovascular stroke. We were able to diagnose the cardiac abnormality by the use of transesophagic echocardiography. We propose the use of this imaging technique for patients with APS even though the transthoracic Doppler echocardiography was found to be normal. In this way we will be able to rule out cardiac lesions which could also be the cause of embolic manifestations.
