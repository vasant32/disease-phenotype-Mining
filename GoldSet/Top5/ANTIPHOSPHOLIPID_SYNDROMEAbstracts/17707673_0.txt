The desire of reproduction is a true challenge for the physicians in charge of patients with chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or other connective tissue diseases. It requires: 1) the strict evaluation of the potential risks of flare of the rheumatic disease because of the pregnancy; 2) the assessment of risks on pregnancy outcome and fetus development; 3) the management of the different anti-rheumatic agents in order to maintain optimal control of disease activity and avoid any teratogenic problem. Besides this, it clearly appears that inflammatory rheumatic diseases may have an impact on patients' fertility, which may be explained by different mechanisms, physical, psychological, hormonal or immunological. Moreover, some treatments may directly affect fertility, which may justify specific managements in order to preserve gonadic functions.
