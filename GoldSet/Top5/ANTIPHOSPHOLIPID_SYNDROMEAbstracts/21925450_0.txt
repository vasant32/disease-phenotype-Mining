We present the clinical and serological characteristics of four patients with rhupus (Simon's definition). The 4 patients with rhupus presented ACR criteria for SLE as well as for RA, ANA positive with titers ranging from 1/80 to 1/5,250, and positive anti-DNA, with the predominance of symmetrical erosive polyarthritis. We found anti-CCP positivity and high titers in 3 of the 4 patients, and positive antiphospholipid antibodies in 2 (anticardiolipin and LA), without manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome. One patient presented renal affection, and 2 subcutaneous nodules. The 3 patients with RA preceded the manifestations of SLE by an average of 7.7 years. Two patients were refractory to conventional DMAR in combination, requiring biologic and mycophennolate mofetil.
