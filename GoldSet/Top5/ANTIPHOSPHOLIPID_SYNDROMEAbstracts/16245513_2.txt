Cardiac involvement is a not uncommon complication in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Herein, the case is reported of cardiac failure in a female patient with Libman-Sacks endocarditis and with primary APS diagnosed eight years previously. Aggressive anticoagulation therapy and medical treatment for the cardiac failure over a 12-month period resulted in a partial regression of the severe mitral regurgitation. Close clinical and echocardiographic surveillance during the follow up of patients with APS and heart valve disease is mandatory. Optimal treatment, including adequate aggressive anticoagulation therapy and specific treatment for heart failure, may play a pivotal role in reducing the severity of valve dysfunction in these patients.
