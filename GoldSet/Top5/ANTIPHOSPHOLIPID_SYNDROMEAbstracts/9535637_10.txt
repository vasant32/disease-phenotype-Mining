PURPOSE: To report a 31-year-old healthy patient with retinal venous occlusion in his left eye attributable to primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. METHODS: The patient was examined clinically. Multiple serologic and clinical investigations were performed to determine the causative disease. He was closely followed up for more than 3 years. RESULTS: The presence of lupus anticoagulant in our patient was indicated by a kaolin clotting time index of 27 (normal, <17) and confirmed by the demonstration of IgG antibodies against phospholipids. After long-term oral anticoagulant treatment for 2 years, lupus anticoagulant levels returned to normal, and therapy was stopped. No further thrombotic event occurred during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In retinal vascular occlusions of unexplained origin, antiphospholipid antibodies may play an important role in the pathogenesis. Detecting these antibodies in the serum of patients with retinal vascular occlusion helps determine the appropriate treatment with long-term oral anticoagulants.
