BACKGROUND: Livedoid vasculopathy is an uncommon condition that affects young patients. It must be clinically distinguished from cutaneous vasculitis. CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old man presented pain and skin eruptions involving the lower limbs, hands and trunk. The skin eruption predominated on the feet with purpuric lesions producing a livedoid pattern, ulcerations on both ankles and white atrophic scars on the dorsum of the feet. Skin biopsy showed dermic vessel thrombosis without leukocytoclasia. These features favored livedoid vasculopathy rather than vasculitis. Anticardiolipin antibodies were positive. The patient was started on antithrombotic therapy. The skin ulcerations regressed and no recurrence has been observed at 7-months follow-up. DISCUSSION: Livedoid vasculopathy is characterized by painful purpuric lesions that generally occur on the lower limbs, and frequently ulcerate and heal leaving porcelain white atrophic scars (atrophic blanche). The histology evidences a thrombotic process. Livedoid vasculopathy is normally described as occurring as a sole entity, however thera have been reports of an association with anticardiolipin antibodies. This suggest a possible link with antiphospholipid syndrome.
