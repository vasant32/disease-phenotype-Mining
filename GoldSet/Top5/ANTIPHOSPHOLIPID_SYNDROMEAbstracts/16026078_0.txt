Clinical laboratory physicians and scientists/technologists in the clinical laboratory of a hospital can provide much more information about laboratory data to medical doctors, by the interpretation of laboratory data, and can provide strategies to understand laboratory results. For example, in a case of circulating anticoagulant without hemorrhage, interpretation of the slightly abnormal APTT is important for precise diagnosis, although it is very difficult to interpret the data in the early stages of the disease. Recently, we experienced a patient (female, age: 61) with strong anti-phospholipid antibody and lymphoma but without thrombosis, and found spuriously elevated FDP and CRP in the patient's immunoglobulin. The information from the laboratory was invaluable in indicating the need for splenorectomy. Another case with abnormalities in blood coagulation tests was discussed. From these experiences, we confirmed that our consultations are very important and can assist in the diagnosis of patients.
