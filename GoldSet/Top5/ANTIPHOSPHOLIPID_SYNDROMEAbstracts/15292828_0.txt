Certain coagulation disorders can occur in patients with cancer and thromboembolic complications are frequent. We report the case of a 53-Year-old patient with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung treated with chemotherapy who presented several cerebral arterial thromboembolic events leading to death a few weeks after the initial diagnosis of cancer. This case illustrates the important role of certain satellite disorders related to coagulation activation: non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome. The role of anticancer chemotherapy as a favoring factor for thromboembolic events is also emphasized in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.
