This report describes a rare case of hypertrophic pachymeningitis secondary to antiphospholipid syndrome in a 37-year-old woman. The patient had a history of antiphospholipid syndrome and developed hypertrophic pachymeningitis subsequently. Pathological examination of the dura mater showed not only fibrous thickening, the typical finding of hypertrophic pachymeningitis, but also thrombosis in the dural microvessels and T cell infiltration without B cell or plasma cell infiltration, suggesting cell-mediated immunity. The dural thickening spontaneously improved and did not deteriorate during corticosteroid therapy. The histological findings and spontaneous remission observed in this case might be characteristic of secondary hypertrophic pachymeningitis with antiphospholipid syndrome. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the pathophysiology of this novel type of hypertrophic pachymeningitis.
