For several months a 23-year-old woman had been suffering from increasingly frequent attacks of bilateral amaurosis fugax. They affected only individual segments of a monocular visual field and finally occurred several times daily. Physical and cardiological examinations as well as echocardiography were within normal limits. Laboratory tests revealed a slight increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high titres of serum antibodies against phospholipids. Fundoscopy did not show any vascular changes. Because vasculitis--possibly as an expression of systemic lupus erythematodes--was suspected, high-dosage treatment with steroids was commenced, but failed to influence the visual disorder. While steroid dosage was gradually decreased, administration of acetylsalicylic acid (for three months 100 mg daily, then three times daily 100 mg) brought about complete disappearance of the visual signs. Their cause was probably a reversible platelet aggregation induced by antiphospholipid antibodies which, because of the physiological characteristics of the terminal retinal vascular bed brought about the isolated sign of recurrent amaurosis fugax.
