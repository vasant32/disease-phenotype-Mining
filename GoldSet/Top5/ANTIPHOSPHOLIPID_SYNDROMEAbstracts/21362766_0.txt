 OBJECTIVE: To compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with and without previous thrombovascular events (TE). METHODS: The Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36) was used to assess HRQOL in 5 patient groups: (1) primary APS (PAPS; n = 35); (2) APS associated to SLE (SAPS; n = 37); (3) SLE+TE without persistent positive antiphospholipid antibody (SLE+TE-aPL; n = 75); (4) SLE-TE+aPL (n = 71); and (5) SLE-TE-aPL (n = 608). RESULTS: The data on both mental component summary and physical component summary (PCS) scores showed an impaired quality of life in all patient groups. Patients in the SLE+TE-aPL group had a lower PCS score compared to patients in the SLE-TE+aPL group. CONCLUSION: The combination of SLE and TE has a more negative influence on reported HRQOL, compared to having SLE or APS alone.
