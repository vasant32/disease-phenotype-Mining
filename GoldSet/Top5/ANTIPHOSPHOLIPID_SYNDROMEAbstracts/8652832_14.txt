Serum reactivities to a panel of phospholipid antigens, including cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylserine (PS), sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 196 human immunodeficiency virus-l+ (HIV-1+) patients with CDC II to IVC clinical disease. Significant levels of IgG to CL, PS, or both were observed in 23 patients lacking evidence of thrombophilic events or any peculiar clinical feature of HIV-1 infection. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses showed that in vitro apoptosis of T cells was increased in patients with high serum anti-PS IgG, whereas the overexpression of Fas/Apo-1 marker was detected in all patients regardless of their antiphospholipid reactivities. Macrophages from patients with significant titers of anti-PS IgG antibodies were not activated by the presence of apoptotic CEM lymphoblasts or by purified anti-PS IgG from the same patients. By contrast, these antibodies greatly improved the effector functions of autologous macrophages in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays using 51Cr-labeled CEM cells, whereas polyspecific IgG were unable to induce an equivalent cytotoxicity in all instances. An increasing effect on ADCC was also observed in tests using macrophages from healthy controls to CEM coated with anti-PS IgG. These results support a potential correlation of anti-PS specificity with T-cell apoptosis in HIV-1 infection. Because PS is exteriorized by apoptotic lymphocytes, its persistence may stimulate antibodies which cooperate with macrophages in the clearance of dead cells by an enhanced ADCC mechanism. This interpretation could explain the absence of thrombophilia in HIV-1+ patients with serum elevations of antiphospholipid reactivities.
