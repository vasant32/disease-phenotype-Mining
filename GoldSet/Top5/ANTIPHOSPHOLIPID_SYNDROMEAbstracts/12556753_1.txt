Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by venous and arterial thrombosis. Antiphospholipid antibodies are essential to making the diagnosis. It may be a primary disorder or it may be secondary to a connective tissue disorder. Cardiac manifestations of this syndrome include both thrombotic and degenerative valvular disease. Systemic or pulmonary embolism, as well as intravascular thrombosis, is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. We present a case of renal infarction in a woman with polymyalgia rheumatica and a positive test for antiphospholipid antibody.
