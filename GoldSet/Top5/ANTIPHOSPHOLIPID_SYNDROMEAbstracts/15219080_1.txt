Advances in the treatment of HIV infection in the recent years have improved the survival of these patients. This improvement in prognosis has been followed by a higher prevalence of kidney disease among these patients. We present a patient with a known HIV infection who developed renal insufficiency. The renal biopsy showed lesions of thrombotic microangiopathy and malignant hypertension with development of vascular and glomerular damage stages. The laboratory studies allowed us the diagnosis of anti phospholipid syndrome. Early diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome in patients with HIV infection is important, because it can have serious implications for the prognosis.
