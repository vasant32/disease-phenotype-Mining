Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic disease that causes venous and arterial thrombosis in virtually any organ and is responsible for fetal losses and pregnancy disorders. Previously, APS was thought to be present mainly in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The spectrum of clinical manifestations is wide, because the thrombotic process may involve arterial and venous vessels of any size in any organ. At present, there is no evidence to support or refute specific treatment strategies for primary prophylaxis of thrombosis.
