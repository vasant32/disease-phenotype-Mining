A patient who underwent redo coronary artery bypass grafting developed severe thrombocytopenia. A platelet transfusion caused recurrent hypotension and hypoxia. The patient status was complicated by a systemic thrombosis including coronary graft occlusion and central vein thrombosis. We found that the lupus anticoagulant, as well as other autoimmune antibodies, was positive only after the thrombotic episode developed. Even though the lupus anticoagulant returned to negative about 2 months after the episode of graft occlusion, the patient eventually died of heart failure.
