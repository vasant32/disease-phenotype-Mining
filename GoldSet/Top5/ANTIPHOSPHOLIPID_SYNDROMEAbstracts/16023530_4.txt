 PURPOSE: To investigate imaging findings, risk factors and outcome in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). METHODS: Records of all patients with diagnosis of CVT between 1992 and 2002 were reviewed. Patients with CNS infection and with CVT secondary to invasive procedures were excluded. Inherited and acquired thrombophilia were searched in all patients. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (18 women, 6 men) with mean age of 29.5 years (range 3-48 years) were identified. Mean follow-up was 44 months (range 11-145 months). The most common symptoms were headache (75%), vomiting (33%) and impairment of consciousness (21%). Probable causes of CVT could be determined in 21 (88%) patients: pregnancy or puerperium in six (25%), oral contraceptive use in four (17%), head trauma in two (8%), mastoiditis in one (4%), nephrotic syndrome in one (4%), systemic disease in three (13%), and inherited thrombotic risk factors in four (17%) patients. CVT associated with pregnancy, puerperium and use of oral contraceptives had a significant better outcome than CVT caused by inherited thrombophilia or systemic disease (OR=14.4; p=0.02). CT scans were abnormal in 15 (62.5%) patients and MRI with gadolinium was abnormal in all. Those with parenchymal involvement had neurological sequelae during follow-up. All were treated with heparin followed by oral anticoagulants, and none had new or worsening of pre-existing intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: MRI is superior to conventional CT for diagnosing CVT. Patients with parenchymal lesions, thrombophilia and antiphospholipid syndrome had greater risk to be left with neurological sequelae. Anticoagulant therapy did not predispose to further intracerebral hemorrhage.
