A 62-year-old woman was admitted to hospital because of chest oppression and abdominal discomfort. Coronary arteriography revealed that the proximal left anterior descending artery had a large thrombus with TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Grade 3 flow. On the second hospital day, she had sudden hematemesis because of esophageal varices. Her general condition became stable with conventional therapy. On the 20th hospital day, coronary arteriography and arterial portography showed that the thrombus had diminished. Arterial portography also revealed total occlusion of the portal vein as well as giant gastric varices. She was diagnosed as antiphospholipid syndrome, based on the presence of lupus anticoagulant. The treatment of this case was very complicated because of the bleeding from the esophageal varices induced by the anticoagulant therapy for the thrombus. Prednisolone was administered for 1 month, but no remarkable effects were observed. Therefore, she was treated with endoscopic sclerotherapy for the esophageal varices and anticoagulant therapy for prevention of thrombosis.
