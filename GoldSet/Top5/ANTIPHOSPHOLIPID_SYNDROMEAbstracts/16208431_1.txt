Cerebrovascular disease is one of the most common symptoms associated with anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and lupus anticoagulant (LA), usually in the form of ischemic stroke. However, many other neurologic disorders have been described in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome or ACA. So far, the precise relation between the presence of antibodies and the development of the disease in many of these cases remain unknown. Transient global amnesia (TGA) is an infrequent neurologic disturbance whose precise pathophysiology is not known. It is characterized by a sudden inability to acquire new information, usually lasting no more than 12 h, and it is not accompanied by any other focal neurological signs or symptoms. We report a patient with TGA with persistent and high levels of ACA and LA and suggest that in patients with TGA, investigation of the possible presence of ACA and/or LA may be warranted because a higher prevalence of TGA in the patients with antiphospholipidic syndrome with respect to the general population may lead to further insights into pathogenesis of neurologic disease associated with antiphospholipidic antibodies.
