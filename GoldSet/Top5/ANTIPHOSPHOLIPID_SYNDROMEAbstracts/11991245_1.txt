The case of a 26-year-old male chronic smoker is reported, who had thrombotic incidences on three occasions in both upper and lower limbs over a 10-month period. Laboratory examinations, including hematologic studies and creatinine, cholesterol, and glucose levels, were normal. However, IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies were detected. Duplex ultrasonography confirmed deep venous thrombosis in both lower limbs (two occurrences) and computer tomography depicted an inferior cava vein thrombosis. The patient fulfilled all of Shionoya's criteria for Buerger's disease, thus suggesting an association between anticardiolipin antibodies and this disease.
