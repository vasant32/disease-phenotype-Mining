This article reports a case of Anton-Babinski syndrome, due to right middle cerebral artery thrombosis and attributed to a likely primary antiphospholipid syndrome. It is always difficult to diagnose the latter, especially in the case of our patient who had a past history of multiple venous thromboses but also a heterozygosity for the mutation of the factor V of Leyden. We reviewed the literature dedicated to the prothrombotic events linked to the presence of these antiphospholipid antibodies: the lupus anticoagulant and the anticardiolipin antibodies.
