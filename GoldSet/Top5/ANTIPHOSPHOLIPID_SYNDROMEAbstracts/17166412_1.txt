Antiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder characterised by recurrent venous or arterial thrombosis and/or foetal losses associated with typical laboratory abnormalities. The initial manifestation of anthiphospholipid syndrome can involve many organ systems either singly or in combination. We describe the case of a 62 yr old female showing schizophrenia-like symptoms in which further evaluations allowed us to diagnose the antiphospolipid syndrome.
