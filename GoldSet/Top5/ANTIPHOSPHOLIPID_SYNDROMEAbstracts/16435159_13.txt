The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies has been reported in a large variety of patients with malignancies. Many case reports and reviews have appeared indicating that the presence of the antiphospholipid antibodies is related to thrombotic associations with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in a proportion of these patients. We investigated the frequency of the thrombotic manifestations in 58 patients demonstrating antiphospholipid antibodies and with a history of neoplasia, including haematologic and lymphoproliferative malignancies. Antiphospholipid antibodies were detected by clotting assay [lupus anticoagulant (LAC)] or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL)] according to the Sapporo criteria. Patients, 39/58, suffered from solid tumours and 19/58 patients from malignant haematologic or lymphoproliferative diseases. One patient was suffering simultaneously from two solid tumours and a malignant lymphoma. Among the patients with solid tumours, 18/39 (46%) patients had thromboembolic complications of the antiphospholipid syndrome. Among the patients with haematologic and lymphoproliferative malignancies, only 6/19 (32%) suffered from thromboembolic complications. There was, however, no relation between the titres of aCL antibodies and the clinical manifestations. The presence, but not the titres, of antiphospholipid antibodies may identify a subset of cancer patients with a high risk of developing thrombotic complications. The frequency of thrombosis, however, is lower in aPL-positive patients with lymphoproliferative and haematological malignancies.
