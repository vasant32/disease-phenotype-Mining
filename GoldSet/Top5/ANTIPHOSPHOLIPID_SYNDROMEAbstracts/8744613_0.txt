BACKGROUND: The clinical associations of anti-lamin autoantibodies were first described in 1973. Since then a number of individual case reports and two small series have been published. These have suggested an association with connective tissue disorders and autoimmune liver disease. AIMS: To identify the clinical and laboratory associations of anti-lamin autoantibodies in an Australian population. METHODS: Retrospective review of routine antinuclear antibody testing between 1990-1994 for characteristics linear staining of nuclear envelope on indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells with clinical status defined by retrospective review of case records. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were identified and the clinical status of 27 patients defined. Eleven patients had associated IgG anti-cardiolipin antibodies; anti-phospholipid syndrome was present in nine. Seven further patients had liver disease; five had autoimmune liver disease, with associated autoantibodies. The remaining nine patients had a diverse group of diseases. There was no correlation between the titre of the autoantibody and clinical status. An association with anti-cardiolipin antibodies was found although the cause remains obscure. CONCLUSION: Anti-lamin autoantibodies, as identified by indirect immunofluorescence, are associated with a diverse group of diseases but particularly with anti-phospholipid syndrome and liver disease. Testing for anti-phospholipid antibodies and more specific markers of systemic lupus erythematosus and autoimmune disease, for example anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibodies and anti-mitochondrial antibodies should be pursued when anti-lamin autoantibodies are detected.
