Antiphospholipid syndrome is a multisystem auto-immune disorder characterized by thrombotic events and the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. Large vessel involvement in the form of thrombosis/stenosis and thrombotic microangiopathy is a commonly described renal finding. However, non-thrombotic glomerulopathies are increasingly being recognized in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. We report a rare occurrence of both renal vein thrombosis and membranous nephropathy in a previously healthy adolescent male. Investigations revealed persistently positive antiphospholipid antibodies in the absence of an underlying systemic autoimmune disorder or malignancy. Our patient responded favourably to anti-proteinuric therapy and anticoagulation with complete resolution of proteinuria and a nearly occlusive thrombus.
