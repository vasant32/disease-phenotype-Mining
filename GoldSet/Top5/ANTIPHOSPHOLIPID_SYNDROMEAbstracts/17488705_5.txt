Interference of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) with coagulation was investigated in 40 aPL-patients (24 with thrombosis) using thrombography. Impairment of the activated protein C anticoagulant pathway was partially offset by the genuine anticoagulant effect. The net result, a procoagulant phenotype, was associated with a 7-fold increased risk of thrombosis in aPL-patients.
