Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are an eterogeneous group of immunoglobulins, that include lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies. Patients with aPL are at high risk of venous and arterial thrombosis, thrombocytopenia and recurrent fetal loss. Antiphospholipid antibodies should be suspected in case of unexplained thrombophilia and prolongation of coagulation assays (aPTT); infact although such antibodies present an anticoagulant effect in vitro, in vivo the interfere with physiological anticoagulant reactions and may have a procoagulant effect. This paper deals with a case report characterized by a poor sintomatology, a short bleeding, but a spread of abnormal laboratoristic findings that give us the opportunity to investigate an uncommon syndrome.
