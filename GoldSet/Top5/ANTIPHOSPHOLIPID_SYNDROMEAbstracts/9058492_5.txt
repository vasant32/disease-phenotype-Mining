Recurrent fetal wastage has been attributed to thrombosis in the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APAS); however, this has not been proven. Assays of coagulation activation fragments which may provide evidence for a role for thrombosis, have not been previously reported in this setting. We therefore investigated whether F1.2 levels are altered in APAS pregnancies. F1.2 levels were performed on plasmas obtained from fifty-four APA patients with a history of persistent elevation of antiphospholipid antibodies and recurrent abortion who were studied during eighty-three consecutive visits. Results from these patients were compared to a control group of thirty-two healthy pregnant females. F1.2 levels were significantly higher in APAS patients than controls in the second trimester (6.5 nM +/- 4.3 nM vs. 1.2 nM +/- 0.9 nM, p < 0.0001), and in the third trimester of pregnancy (8.6 nM +/- 2.5 nM vs. 3.7 nM +/- 2.0 nM, p < 0.0001). The F1.2 levels in the APA group returned to baseline soon after delivery. No correlation was observed between F1.2 and APA values. This study shows that pregnant patients with a history of recurrent abortions and APA have significantly increased activation of prothrombin compared to healthy pregnant females. These data indicate that the potential value of activations peptide assays such as F1.2 in this setting should be tested in prospective clinical trials.
