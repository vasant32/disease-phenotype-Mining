OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlation between antiphospholipid antibodies (APA), activated protein C resistance (APCR) and antiphospholipid thrombosis (APL-T) syndrome and further investigate the mechanism of thrombosis in APL-T syndrome. METHODS: ELISA, PTT-LA and APTT +/- APC methods were used to detect anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), lupus anticoagulants (LA) and APC R in 20 APL-T syndrome patients. RESULTS: Twenty patients were diagnosed as APL-T. ACA-IgG, M and LA are strongly associated with APL-T. The incidence of APCR in APL-T (75%) was significantly higher than that of the normal group (5%). CONCLUSION: There was high prevalence of APCR in APL-T, which was strongly associated with LA. It is proposed that acquired APCR induced by APA is a key to understanding thrombosis in Chinese APL-T patients.
