We report a case of a 21-year-old university student with underlying lupus nephritis who presented with recurrent symptoms of fever, haemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain. CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed pulmonary embolism in the right subsegmental pulmonary arteries. One week later, she developed left renal vein and left common iliac vein thromboses, with new emboli in the left subsegmental pulmonary arteries. We hereforth discuss the diagnostic issues of a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on corticosteroids therapy, and also treatment of the antiphospholipid syndrome.
