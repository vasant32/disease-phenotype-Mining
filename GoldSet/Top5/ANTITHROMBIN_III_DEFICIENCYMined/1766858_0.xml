<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thrombotic disease</z:e> can result either from increased deposition or decreased dissolution of fibrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the first observation of a familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, numerous inherited defects of antithrombotin III, protein C, protein S, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II and plasminogen have been described and were assumed to be responsible of a thrombophilic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However a disparity in the clinical expression of heterozygous deficiency in coagulation inhibitors or molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>abnormalities of coagulation</z:hpo> does exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On one hand, the prevalence of such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">molecular diseases</z:e> is not yet perfectly known and on the other hand, contributory factors (acquired environmental insults or other genetic abnormalities) could play a role in individuals already predisposed to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The molecular genetics of deficiencies is going to help us to establish specific gene lesions and thromboembolic history relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analysis of structural or regulatory mutations in the genes of the different coagulation inhibitors, of the molecules of the fibrinolytic system, and of the fibrinogen molecule will greatly increase our knowledge of the molecular basis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The influence of the genetic polymorphism of these molecules on the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> should be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, cellular aspects of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> including the role of blood cells and endothelial cells will bring lot of informations on the comprehension of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
