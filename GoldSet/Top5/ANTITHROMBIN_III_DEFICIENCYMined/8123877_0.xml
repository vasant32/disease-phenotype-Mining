<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Usually, heterozygous patients with this defect have little or no thrombotic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> has never been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a young woman who had an episode of right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The computed tomographic scan showed an ischemic lesion in the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no previous thrombotic episodes in the patient's history and the sole risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was taking of an oral contraceptive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Her family history was midly positive for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> in two relatives) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antithrombin III antigen, low <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity and an increased slow-moving peak in crossed-immunoelectrophoresis with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same pattern was found in 7 of 20 relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, a diagnosis of congenital type II C defective antithrombin III was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This report suggests that young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> should be screened for defective antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
