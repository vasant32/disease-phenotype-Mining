<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 72 consecutive DVT patients, the presence of DVT was suspected based on a history of lower limb swelling and tenderness with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo>, and was confirmed by duplex scanning, radioisotope venography, or contrast venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DPG was identified by the observation of dissociation between the activity and antigenicity of plasminogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 72 patients, 9 (12.5%) were diagnosed as having DPG, and several <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin-III deficiency</z:hpo> and protein C and S deficiency were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the genetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and DPG patients was 52 +/- 15 and 40 +/- 15 years, respectively (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, these findings suggest that DPG is deeply related to the development of DVT, and that abnormality of the fibrinolytic system is one of the major etiologic factors in DVT </plain></SENT>
