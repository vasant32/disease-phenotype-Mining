<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A familial abnormal antithrombin III (AT-III) is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The characteristic of the abnormality in this family is low <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progressive antithrombin activity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or rather increased level of AT-III antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient is a 23-year-old female who had suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> involving her lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Her plasma AT-III antigen concentration was 54 mg/dl and progressive antithrombin and factor Xa inhibitory activities were of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity of her plasma was as low as 26% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) containing <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in the first dimension <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi>, patient's AT-III showed no increase in electrophoretic mobility compared to that in the absence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, suggesting that the patient's AT-III has no affinity for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From CIE pattern in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, the patient was found to be a homozygote, and parents and one of her younger sisters were heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> is proposed to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
