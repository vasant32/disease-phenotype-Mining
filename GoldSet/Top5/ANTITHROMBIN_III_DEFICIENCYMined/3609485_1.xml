<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the clinical importance of acquired ATIII deficiency, whether spontaneous or associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-containing oral contraceptive treatment, remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moderately reduced ATIII activity before or immediately after surgery is neither sensitive nor specific for a high risk of postoperative venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE), while moderately reduced ATIII activity during <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment for VTE fails to indicate an unusually large <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> requirement or to predict recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the absence of good clinical trials, the value of ATIII replacement therapy also remains obscure; its use in congenital deficiency is largely based on anecdote, and while it may cause more rapid correction of the hemostatic defect in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>), any improvement in morbidity or mortality resulting from ATIII replacement remains to be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
