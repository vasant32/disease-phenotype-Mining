<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A control group of 20 healthy adults was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AT III was measured as antigen concentration (Ag) and antithrombin or anti-factor Xa <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor (H.C.) activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Crossed immunoelectrophoresis on <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> (H-CIE) was carried out on plasma samples; moreover the distribution of isoantithrombins was investigated on whole plasma by a technique of crossed immunoelectrofocusing (CIEF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AT III plasma levels in full term infants were significantly lower as compared to the adult values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The preterm newborns group showed a further significant decrease in AT III levels as compared to the full term neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infants AT III H-CIE runs displayed a single fast moving anodal peak, so that a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> binding to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CIEF AT III plasma pattern of the adults as well as of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neonates displayed three major peaks at pH range 5.2-4.9, a small amount of AT III at pH 4.9-4.8 and a minor peak at pH 4.8-4.6, so that it was concluded that the isoantithrombins plasma distribution in neonatal age is identical to that of the adult subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four neonates whose mothers were affected by AT III congenital defect were also investigated: diagnosis of congenital deficiency was established in three cases </plain></SENT>
