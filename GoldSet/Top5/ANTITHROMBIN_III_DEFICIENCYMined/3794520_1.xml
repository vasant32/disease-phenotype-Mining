<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that binding to an endogenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-like substance controls breakdown of antithrombin III (ATIII) in vivo, the metabolic behavior of a commercial ATIII concentrate was investigated in three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and five subjects with hereditary ATIII deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concentrate, purified to homogeneity as evidenced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>--gel electrophoresis, was a 2:1 mixture of functional ATIII with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity and dysfunctional ATIII incapable of binding enzymes or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each subject received intravenously a dose of 75 U/kg of ATIII activity together with <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> 125-labeled tracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Daily fractional catabolic rates calculated from the three-exponential disappearance curves of plasma radioactivity were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> investigated subjects and were within the range obtained in studies using functionally homogeneous tracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects had markedly increased ATIII levels after injection of the concentrate, the relative sizes of their ATIII distribution pools resembled those reported previously for people with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ATIII concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was, however, a noticeably faster disappearance from plasma of excess functional ATIII compared with that of ATIII antigen, with mean half-lives of 47.5 +/- 9 hours and 62.3 +/- 8 hours, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Assuming that antigenic ATIII represented both functional inhibitor and dysfunctional ATIII incapable of binding <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, these data are consistent with the supposition that interaction with endogenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or a similar substance may regulate a catabolic pathway marking ATIII for destruction </plain></SENT>
