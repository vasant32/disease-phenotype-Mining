<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The genetic basis of Type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> has been investigated in six unrelated kindred with positive histories of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> using a PCR amplification/direct sequencing approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four frameshift mutations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> introducing premature translation termination codons were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, deletions, of a C at nucleotide position 2599 or 2600, a G at position 2601-2602 and a CT <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> at position 7428-7429 were detected in three kindred and confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The identical insertion, of a T at nucleotide 2770, was observed in two apparently unrelated families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding may have been due to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect since antithrombin gene polymorphism analysis showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected individuals to share a common haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An in frame deletion of 6 bp at nucleotide position 2690-2696 causing the removal of codons 76 and 77 encoding Ile 76 and Phe 77 was also detected indicating that these amino acids are essential for stability of the mature antithrombin </plain></SENT>
