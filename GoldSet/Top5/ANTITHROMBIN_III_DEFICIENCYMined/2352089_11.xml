<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology is thought to be placental transfer of emboli or thromboplastic material through vascular shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thromboplastic material precipitates <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) in the fetus, with a resultant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> due to relative fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two cases of this syndrome will be discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The case of a live-born twin with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011100'>intestinal atresia</z:hpo>, who developed in utero with a fetus papyraceous, is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emboli were demonstrated in vascular shunts of the diamniotic-monochorionic placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011100'>intestinal atresia</z:hpo> as a result of a vascular accident is reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another case involving a live-born twin with congenital skin defects, who developed in utero with a fetus papyraceous, is also reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The skin defects were a congenital disruption from fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> with resultant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several other manifestations of the placental emboli syndrome will be discussed and the vascular etiology of the disruptions explained </plain></SENT>
