<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011900'>Hypofibrinogenemia</z:hpo> and increased fibrin(ogen) degradation products in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> have been attributed to intravascular thrombin generation triggered by leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the strict relationship between fibrinogen catabolism and turnover of fibrinopeptide A (FPA), which is a sensitive and specific marker of thrombin activity, has not been evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) to see whether mechanisms other than thrombin activity could be responsible for fibrinogen consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here the 125I-fibrinogen kinetics and FPA measurements in 19 patients with AL, 6 of them with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiolabelled fibrinogen kinetics were studied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients concomitantly with the start of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fibrinopeptide A was measured by a radioimmunoassay at time of diagnosis and during chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of disappearance of radiolabelled fibrinogen where biphasic, with a rapid phase in the first 1-3 days of chemotherapy and a subsequent slow phase associated with the reduction or disappearance of blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> had a significantly shorter half-life and turnover than patients without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The latter group had significant shortening of these parameters in comparison to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The thrombin-dependent catabolic rate of fibrinogen, calculated from the mean level of FPA during the first phase of disappearance curve and by assuming 2 moles of FPA generated per <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027962,C0027960" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mole</z:e> of fibrinogen, was similar in patients without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, whereas patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> had a significantly higher catabolic rate, even though the increase was not sufficient to account for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the turnover of fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No relationship was observed between fibrinogen turnover and FPA turnover </plain></SENT>
