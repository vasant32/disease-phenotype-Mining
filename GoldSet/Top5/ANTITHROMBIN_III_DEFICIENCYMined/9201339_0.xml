<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, deficiencies of fibrinolytic factors emerged as an important etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the young population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The literature has emphasized the diagnosis of such conditions especially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases of undetermined etiology and with history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We carried out a research on the serum level of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III in young patients, between 15 and 40 years, with CI of undetermined cause after application of a standard protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients had low levels of these proteins; two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of them had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that systematic investigation of such causes of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> will reduce the group of undetermined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and will open the possibility of prophylactic treatment in a non-negligible group of patients </plain></SENT>
