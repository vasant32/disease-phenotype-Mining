<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Examination of the genetic code and the sequence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antithrombin III revealed that these amino acid substitutions could arise from the substitution of either two <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> or a single nucleotide at codon 393 of the antithrombin III gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two families, detection of the ATIII variants by genetic linkage analysis was not possible owing to lack of informative RFLP markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we synthesized two 22-base-long oligonucleotides specific for the single-base substitutions in the region of codon 393 and demonstrated by oligonucleotide hybridization that the molecular defect of ATIII Northwick Park is caused by the CGT----TGT mutation at codon 393 and that ATIII Glasgow is caused by the CGT----CAT mutation at codon 393 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These oligonucleotide probes should prove useful as an alternative method for early detection of the ATIII variants </plain></SENT>
