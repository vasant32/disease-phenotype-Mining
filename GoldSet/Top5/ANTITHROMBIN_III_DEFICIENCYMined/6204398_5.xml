<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No history of thrombotic episodes was associated with this abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma antithrombin concentration as well as the rate of thrombin inactivation by defibrinated plasma in the absence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity was decreased by about 50% in plasma of affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, about half the amount of plasma antithrombin did not bind to gel bound <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover the crossed immunoelectrophoretic pattern in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> demonstrated two peaks of antithrombin, the slower one migrating as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antithrombin when <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was omitted from the first <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that molecular alteration of the antithrombin molecule seemed to affect only the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding site thus preventing from any rate enhancement of thrombin inactivation </plain></SENT>
