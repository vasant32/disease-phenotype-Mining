<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present an additional family with AT III deficiency and a high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AT III levels were determined by both a functional and an immunologic assay </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following gel filtration, the platelets were very sensitive to thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thrombin-induced platelet aggregation appears to be dependent on a balance between the amount of thrombin and AT III present </plain></SENT>
