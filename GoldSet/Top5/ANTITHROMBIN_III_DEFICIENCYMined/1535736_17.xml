<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both F1 + 2 and FPA were measured with simple, commercially available ELISA methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High levels of F1 + 2 or FPA were found in about one fourth of the patients as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When patients were divided according to the type of inherited thrombophilic syndrome, it appeared that F1 + 2 was more frequently elevated in protein C and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiencies</z:e> than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e>; and that, in general, it was no more frequently elevated than FPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although our data confirm the existence of a procoagulant imbalance in inherited thrombophilic syndromes due to defects of natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> proteins, they do not confirm that such imbalance can be more frequently diagnosed by measuring F1 + 2 levels, particularly in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
