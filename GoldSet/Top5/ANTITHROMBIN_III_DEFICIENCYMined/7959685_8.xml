<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were used to determine the nature of the mutations in the antithrombin III (AT3) gene in seven unrelated patients with familial antithrombin III (ATIII) deficiency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three novel mutations were found, two associated with a type I deficiency state (Pro80--&gt;Thr and His120--&gt;Tyr) manifesting reduced synthesis of ATIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other novel lesion (Met251--&gt;Ile) was associated with a dysfunctional ATIII protein (type II ATIII deficiency) and is predicted to interfere either with a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-induced conformational change in the ATIII molecule or with docking to thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A novel polymorphism (Tyr158--&gt;Cys) was also found to occur in several individuals of Scandinavian origin </plain></SENT>
