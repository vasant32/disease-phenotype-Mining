<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical data from 32 consecutive patients who underwent endovascular or open surgical reconstruction of central veins because of symptomatic benign SVC syndrome between November 1983 and June 2001 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 17 male and 15 female patients (mean age, 38 years; range, 5-69 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Presenting symptoms were head fullness (n = 26), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> or orthopnea (n = 23), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (n = 17), or dizziness (n = 11); physical signs were head swelling (n = 31), chest wall collateral vessels (n = 29), facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo> (n = 18), or arm swelling (n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Etiologic factors included mediastinal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (n = 19), indwelling catheter (n = 8), idiopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n = 4), or post-surgery (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients were heterozygous for factor V Leiden; 1 patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients underwent surgical reconstruction with 31 bypass grafts: spiral saphenous vein (n = 20), superficial femoral vein (n = 4), human allograft (n = 1), or expanded <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (ePTFE, n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or stenting; 3 primary and 8 secondary endovascular procedures were performed to treat graft stenosis (n = 7) or occlusion (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five early graft failures in 3 ePTFE grafts and 2 bifurcated vein grafts (<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, n = 4; stenosis, n = 1) were successfully treated with open surgical revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up of 5.6 years (range, 0.4-16.6 years) in surgical patients, 17 additional secondary interventions were performed in 8 patients, 14 endovascular and 3 surgical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates of surgical bypass grafts were 63%, 79%, and 85%, respectively, at 1 year, and 53%, 68%, and 80%, respectively, at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Graft patency was significantly higher in vein grafts compared with ePTFE grafts (P =.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or stenting was 3.1 years (range, 1 day-11.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Twelve secondary endovascular interventions were performed in 6 patients (primary group, 3 of 3; secondary group, 3 of 9 grafts in 8 patients) to maintain patency in 11 of 12 reconstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up in the entire patient cohort was 5.3 years (range, 0.4-16.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In 79% of patients symptoms had resolved or were significantly improved at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of benign SVC syndrome is effective over the long term, with secondary endovascular interventions to maintain graft patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Straight spiral saphenous vein graft remains the conduit of choice for surgical reconstruction, with results superior to those with bifurcated vein and ePTFE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment is effective over the short term, with frequent need for repeat interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It does not adversely affect future open surgical reconstruction and may prove to be a reasonable primary intervention in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Patients who are not suitable for or who fail endovascular intervention merit open surgical reconstruction </plain></SENT>
