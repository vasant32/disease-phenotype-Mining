<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Frameshift mutations of one base and two bases, respectively, were found to have occurred in two unrelated patients at the same GAG codon (Glu 245) within exon 4 of the ATIII gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A literature search showed six further hitherto unrecognized deletion "hotspots" in four other human genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These deletion-prone sites exhibited sufficient sequence homology with each other to derive a consensus sequence (T G A/G A/G G A/C), suggesting that deletion in human genes may not only be non-random but also sequence-directed </plain></SENT>
