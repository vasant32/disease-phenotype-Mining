<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood 85, 1527-1534, 1995) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compared the antithrombotic effects of DHG in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and in ATIII-deficient mice with those of unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (UFH) and low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DHG, unlike UFH and LMWH, exerted an in vivo antithrombotic effect even in mice with decreased plasma ATIII activity (about 30% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then compared the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and antithrombotic effects of DHG in mice with those of high molecular weight (HMW)-DHG, low molecular weight (LMW)-DHG, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18376">dermatan sulfate</z:chebi> (DS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In terms of in vitro <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity assessed by use of purified human components, DHGs (DHG, HMW-DHG, and LMW-DHG) had different anti-thrombin activity in the presence of HCII and anti-factor Xase activities, which differences were dependent on the molecular weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With respect to in vivo antithrombotic activity, DHG, HMW-DHG, and LMW-DHG showed almost the same inhibitory effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in mice (minimum effective dose [MED]: &gt; 0.3 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since the antithrombotic activities of DHGs were not correlated with the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>-specific activities, the contribution of the two <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activities to the in vivo antithrombotic effect of DHGs remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, DHG was more effective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in mice than DS (MED &gt; 1 or &gt; 3 mg/kg), which showed no inhibitory activity toward factor Xase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it seems that factor Xase inhibition contributes greatly to the antithrombotic effect of DHG and that DHG exerts this effect in mice mainly by inhibiting factor Xase </plain></SENT>
