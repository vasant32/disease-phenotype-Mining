<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of this strategy in pregnant women requires documentation of fetal safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE: A woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> during early pregnancy and could not be successfully managed long term with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One milligram of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> daily was used for prophylaxis, and serial fetal blood samples were used to monitor the fetal coagulation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No apparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> were demonstrated in the fetus at 33, 36, and 38 weeks' gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The woman suffered no further thromboses throughout the remainder of her pregnancy and puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of fixed mini-dose <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for prophylaxis in pregnancies at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> will require further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This fetus did not appear vulnerable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> as a consequence of the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> regimen </plain></SENT>
