<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A deficiency of serum antithrombin III was found in approximately half of the 13 family members by either coagulant or immunologic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No clear relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> and a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet antithrombin assays were also studied in the same subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 13 members were deficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the remaining three had a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these findings, the hypothesis is proposed that in some cases familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> may be due to a platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> and that the serum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> in some cases is a secondary rather than a primary effect </plain></SENT>
