<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the demographics, presentation, family history, and laboratory findings in children with clinically recognized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected about children with clinically recognized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> from 1987 to 1994 at two pediatric hematology referral centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen children, mean age 11.8 years (standard deviation 4.69 years) including 11 boys were affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lower extremity thromboses were present in 7/14 children evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 16 children were apparently well before development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e>; seven were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the 15 children tested were antithrombin III deficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of 14 children tested was protein C deficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of 13 children tested were protein S deficient or had a free protein S antigen at the fifth percentile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of 10 children tested had an acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0011901'>dysfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of nine children tested had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our limited data suggest at least 70% of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> referred for hematology evaluation have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and coagulation regulatory protein abnormalities </plain></SENT>
