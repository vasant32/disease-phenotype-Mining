<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a trial involving 61 patients suffering from shock and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, the relations between the concentration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, the effect of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> on coagulation and the activity of AT III were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> decreased to one-half when the activity of AT III was 75 per cent of the average <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 50 per cent AT III, the effect of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When AT III was substituted the disappearance rate of the AT III activity from circulation was considerably increased in the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, while the concentration of AT III when measured immunologically, did not show an increased disappearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This difference suggests increased consumption of AT III by active serine proteases of coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients substituted with AT III, the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> was between 16 h and 19 h, while it was 3.3 days in patients who received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The survival rate of most severe cases of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> showed a distinct trend towards improvement, but significance was lacking, probably due to the small number of comparable cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When AT III and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> were given simultaneously, there was no further shortening of the duration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>; however, severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications occurred in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The substitution of AT III was calculated on the following basis: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> an increase in AT III activity of 1 per cent can be expected when 1 unit/kg body weight is given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The same dose of AT III increases the plasma level by 1.8 per cent when the clotting system is unaffected </plain></SENT>
