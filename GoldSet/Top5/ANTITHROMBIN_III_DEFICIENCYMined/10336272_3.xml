<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The elegant report from Hagglund et al1 recently published in Blood raises a very important ethical issue in clinical hematology practice: primum non nocere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors describe the impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7627">norethisterone</z:chebi> treatment, routinely used in the prevention of menstrual <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in women submitted to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">veno-occlusive disease</z:e>, which is one of most dreadful complications of an otherwise successfull stem cell transplantation (SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is an example of how we can interfere dramatically on the outcome of transplantation by simply adding an unsafe drug to the corollary of what we call "supportive treatment." Neverthless, the management of menstrual <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> during the phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in premenopausal women may still be troublesome and requires specific treatment, particularly when concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017411" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gynecological disorders</z:e> are present (ie, uterine fibromyomata or dysfunctionl <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>), and the use of estroprogestinics should be clearly avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Estroprogestinics may induce liver toxicity, primarily <z:hpo ids='HP_0001406'>intrahepatic cholestasis</z:hpo> and transaminitis,2 and they also interfere with hemostasis through a reduction in the natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> protein S and an increase in factor II levels inducing a thrombophilic state, which may be further amplified by genetically determined prothrombotic defects that occur fairly commonly in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These defects include activated protein C resistance related to factor V Leiden, factor II G20210 A mutation, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>.3-5 </plain></SENT>
