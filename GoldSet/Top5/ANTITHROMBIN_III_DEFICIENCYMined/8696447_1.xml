<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory activity of the concentrate, measured by chromogenic assay, correlates well with the manufacturer's quoted activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean in vivo recovery of the product was 0.0124 iu mL-1 per iu of antithrombin (AT) concentrate administered by kilogram body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The recovery was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnostic groups studied and did not vary during the course of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consumption of the antithrombin concentrate was monitored by measuring the production of thrombin-antithrombin complexes and the loss of plasma antithrombin activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean concentration of thrombin-antithrombin complexes was elevated (23 ng mL-1) at the time of admission to the intensive care unit and fell progressively over the next 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean time for the decay of half the antithrombin activity was 23 h during the first 24 h of therapy and rose to 42.1 h after day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The recovery and half-life measurements are necessary to plan an appropriate dosage regimen for the administration of this antithrombin concentrate in acquired deficiency states </plain></SENT>
