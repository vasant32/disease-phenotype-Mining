<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Acquired antithrombin III (AT) deficiency may render <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> less effective during cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors examined the pharmacodynamics and optimal dose of recombinant human AT (rh-AT) needed to maintain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT activity during CPB, optimize the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> response to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, and attenuate excessive activation of the hemostatic system in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six patients scheduled to undergo elective primary coronary artery bypass grafting and who had received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> for 12 h or more before surgery were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten cohorts of three patients each received rh-AT in doses of 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 175, or 200 U/kg, a cohort of six patients received 150 U/kg of rh-AT, and a control group of six patients received placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Antithrombin III activity exceeded 600 U/dl before CPB at the highest dose (200 U/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Doses of 75 U/kg rh-AT normalized AT activity to 100 U/dl during CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activated clotting times during CPB were significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) greater in patients who received rh-AT (844 +/- 191 s) compared with placebo patients (531 +/- 180 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant (P = 0.001) inverse relations were observed between rh-AT dose and both fibrin monomer (r = -0.51) and D-dimer (r = -0.51) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No appreciable adverse events were observed with any rh-AT doses used in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of native AT with transgenically produced protein (rh-AT) in cardiac surgical patients was well tolerated and resulted in higher activated clotting times during CPB and decreased levels of fibrin monomer and D-dimer </plain></SENT>
