<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The etiology of cerebrovascular disease in the paediatric population, remains unknown in up to 40% of the cases ("idiopathic"), but recent advances could improve this percentage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We devised a comprehensive study protocol for such investigation aimed at the identification of potentially modifiable risk factors for paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From the 141 patients initially registered in our data base for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> population (from January 1984 until December 1995), we invited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with idiopathic cerebrovascular disease to complete the study protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>New cases appeared from January 1996 until July 1999 were also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 68 cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found an etiology in 38% and in 76% of the cases we found at least one risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> was the most frequent risk factor identified (36% of patients versus 5% of controls), one of them an infant with fatal haemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>31% of the patients had thrombotic risk factors (protein S, protein C, antithrombine III deficiency, factor V Leiden, etc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>17.6% had unspecific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0743841" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">febrile illness</z:e> at the time of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and 11.6% had minor head injuries before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of the protocol improves the identification of potentially modifiable risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in childhood and may serve as a practical guideline for clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> protocol is as important as management strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or for recurrence prevention, currently under consideration in the adult population </plain></SENT>
