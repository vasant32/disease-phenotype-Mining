<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Identification of mutations in the SERPINC1 gene has revealed different mechanisms responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deletions and nonsense mutations associate with type I deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Certain missense mutations cause type II deficiency by affecting the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding site or the reactive center loop, while others result in type I deficiency by intracellular retention or <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the molecular, biochemical, proteomic and glycomic characterization of a new natural mutant (K241E) that may be classified as pleiotropic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mutation caused a significant decrease in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity mainly due to a reduced <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> affinity and a modification of the electrostatic potential that might explain the impaired ability of the mutant protein to form complexes with the target protease in the absence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mass spectrometry and glycomic analyses confirmed an increased molecular weight of 800 Da in the mutant protein possibly due to core-fucosylation, provoking the loss of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, carriers of this mutation also have a minor mutant isoform that still followed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> glycosylation, retaining similar <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> affinity to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> alpha-antithrombin, and certain <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity, which may explain the milder thrombotic risk of patients carrying this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed using recombinant K241E antithrombin molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a new mechanism involved in antithrombin type II deficiency by indirectly affecting the glycosylation of a natural variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are required to confirm this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
