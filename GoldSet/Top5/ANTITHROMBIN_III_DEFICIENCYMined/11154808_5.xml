<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 55 such patients under age 50, we systematically searched for deficiencies of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No abnormalities of protein C or antithrombin III were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had a deficiency of protein S, which was most likely acquired rather than inherited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients who lack clinical features of a prothrombotic state, the yield of testing for protein C, S and AT III deficiency is likely to be low </plain></SENT>
