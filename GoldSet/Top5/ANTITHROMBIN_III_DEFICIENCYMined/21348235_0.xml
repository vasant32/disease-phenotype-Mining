<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, genetic diagnostics of pathogenic splicing abnormalities are increasingly recognized as critically important in the clinical genetic diagnostics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is reported that approximately 10% of pathogenic mutations causing human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited diseases</z:e> are splicing mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, it is still difficult to identify splicing abnormalities in routine genetic diagnostic settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied two different kinds of cases with splicing abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first case is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide analyses revealed that the proband had a previously reported G to C substitution in the invariant AG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> at the splicing acceptor site of intronl/exon2, which produces multiple splicing abnormalities resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second case is an antithrombin (AT) deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This proband had a previously reported G to A substitution, at nucleotide position 9788 in intron 4, 14 bp in front of exon 5, which created a de novo exon 5 splice site and resulted in AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From a practical standpoint, we discussed the pitfalls, attentions, and screening approaches in genetic diagnostics of pathogenic splicing abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Due to the difficulty with full-length sequence analysis of introns, and the lack of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> samples, splicing mutations may escape identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although current genetic testing remains to be improved, to screen for splicing abnormalities more efficiently, it is significant to use an appropriate combination of various approaches such as DNA and/or <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> samples, splicing mutation databases, bioinformatic tools to detect splice sites and cis-regulatory elements, and in vitro and/or in vivo experimentally methods as needed </plain></SENT>
