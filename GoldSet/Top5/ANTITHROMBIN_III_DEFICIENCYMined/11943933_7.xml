<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four coagulation activation markers were utilized to assess these patients [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for soluble fibrin polymer (TpP), prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and D-dimer] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean levels of the activation markers directly correlated with the number of hypercoagulable abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with increased TpP levels for each group was lower than the other activation markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that activation markers reflect the number of underlying thrombophilic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that there is a utility in performing a panel of coagulation activation markers to assess the thrombotic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The measurement of soluble fibrin polymer may be more reflective of an impending vascular event </plain></SENT>
