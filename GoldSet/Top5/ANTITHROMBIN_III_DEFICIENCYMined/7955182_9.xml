<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> needs the plasma protein antithrombin III to function as an inhibitor of thrombin, and local <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> might therefore limit the antithrombotic effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present double-blind study, 615 consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), of a total of 713 stenoses, were prospectively randomized to receive a bolus injection of 15,000 U <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> followed by a continuous intracoronary infusion via the guiding catheter of either 250 U <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> per minute or 250 U <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plus 25 U antithrombin III per minute during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four clinical variables, 19 lesion-specific characteristics, and 16 procedure-related variables were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Procedural success was assessed by quantitative angiography; procedure-related ischemic complications were analyzed during in-hospital follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Procedural success rates (&lt; 50% final diameter stenosis and no major ischemic complication) were similar, with 85% in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> group (n = 324 patients) and 83% in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>+antithrombin III group (n = 291 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Percent diameter stenosis after PTCA was 39 +/- 18% in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> group and 40 +/- 20% in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>+antithrombin III group (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the two groups with respect to PTCA-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vessel occlusion, angiographic evidence of intracoronary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, post-procedure <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase increase, Q-wave <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or emergency coronary artery bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-risk subgroup analysis revealed no beneficial effect of adjunctive intracoronary antithrombin III in any of the analyzed subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, although risk stratification according to the criteria of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force classification proved to be very useful for the entire study population, no beneficial effect of intracoronary antithrombin III infusion was observed in any of the different risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> alone, adjunctive intracoronary antithrombin III therapy does not appear to have any beneficial effect on procedural outcome as well as type and frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complications during PTCA even in subgroups of patients with a high risk for thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, a local deficiency of antithrombin III does not play a major role for the failure of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> to abolish thrombotic complications during PTCA </plain></SENT>
