<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases in which coagulation factors have been analysed, a deficiency of AT-IIIc and factor VIIc has been reported, the cause of which has not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activation of coagulation with consumption of coagulation factors has been postulated as the mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper reports a longitudinal study of two patients: patient 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> and his asymptomatic sister, patient 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before start of therapy in patient 1, a reduction of FVIIc, other coagulation factors, and AT-IIIc was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Markers of activation of coagulation (F1 + 2, TAT, FM, D-dimers) were elevated only in patient 1, and only at the time of thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patient 2 reduced levels of FVIIc and other coagulation proteins, and a low borderline AT-IIIc level was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the two patients, sustained activation of coagulation can be reasonably excluded to be the cause of low levels of coagulation proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vitamin therapy with 15 mg <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and 600 mg <z:chebi fb="5" ids="16709">pyridoxine</z:chebi> per day led to almost complete normalization of amino acids in urine and plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> has not recurred to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FVIIc and the other coagulation proteins and AT-IIIc increased in parallel with the biochemical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Direct inhibition of the activity of AT-III and coagulation factor VIII and other factors by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> was attempted in vitro but could not be shown at HC concentrations known to occur in the plasma of HOCY patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in these patients, deficient synthesis of coagulation factors and AT-III due to a disturbance of amino acid metabolism is still the most probable explanation for the observed low levels </plain></SENT>
