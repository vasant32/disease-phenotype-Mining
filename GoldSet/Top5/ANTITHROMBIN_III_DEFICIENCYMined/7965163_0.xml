<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a case of multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> associated with congenital AT III deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was made by 111In-labeled platelet scintigraphy (In-scan) which allowed for the daily assessment of thromboemboli size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thromboemboli were found not only in sites predicted clinically, but also in unexpected sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these patients, thus, a careful whole-body examination is necessary for full detection of thromboemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In-scan may be a useful technique for such screening </plain></SENT>
