<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were stratified for schedule of antithrombotic prophylaxis and followed for a total period of 160 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were observed for a total incidence of 4.3% pts.-ys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was not significantly different in patients of different age, sex and schedule of prophylaxis, although there was a trend to a lower incidence in young individuals and in those receiving long-term oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with AT III deficiency had an higher incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than patients with Protein C or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Protein S deficiency</z:e> (12 vs. 2.8 vs. 3.3% pts.-ys, p &lt; 0.05), despite the fact that they were, on average, younger and more prophylaxed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>Antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> constitutes a greater risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than congenital deficiencies of Protein C and Protein S </plain></SENT>
