<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper reports an 8 months old South African Black male infant with multiple large vessel venous and arterial thromboses, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0276088" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">E. coli septicaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was associated with an extremely low plasma AT-III level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001413'>Micronodular cirrhosis</z:hpo> and intracytoplasmic hyaline globules in the liver cells were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These globules were eosinophilic, and <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-positive after diastase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They measured approximately 5 mu to 30 muin diameter, occurred singly in the liver cells and were located mainly in the periportal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histological findings in the liver are similar to those observed in alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency in which the intracytoplasmic globules represent accumulation of altered AAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunochemical studies carried out on formalin fixed tissue failed to detect cross reaction material with anti-alpha 1 antitrypsin or anti-AT III antiserum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first case report of AT-III deficiency presenting in infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is also the first case associated with distinctive liver pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The available data presented are insufficient to distinguish between an inborn defect and acquired caused of the severely depressed AT-III plasma level and the distinctive liver pathology </plain></SENT>
