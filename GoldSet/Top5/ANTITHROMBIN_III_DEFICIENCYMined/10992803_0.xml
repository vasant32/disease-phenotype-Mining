<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>37 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (VT) and 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (ArT) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean ages of the patients with VT and ArT were 46 years (range 20-70) and 38 years (range 32-40), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activity of AT III was measured by commercially available immuno-turbidimetric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The activities of PC and PS were determined by coagulometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The APC resistance was measured using a modified APTT-based clotting assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the VT patients, there were 2 cases (5.4%) with AT III, 5 (13.51%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e>, 5 (13.51%) with PS deficiency and 2 (5.4%) with APC resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the ArT patient group, there was 1 patient (5.88%) with AT III, 3 (17.64%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e>, 1 (5.88%) with PS deficiency and no APC resistant patients, while there was one (2.08%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e> and one (2.08%) with APC resistance in the control group (49 persons, mean age 41 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (odds ratio) was 1.7 in the deficiency of PC and 5.6 in the deficiency of PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data presented suggests that the prevalences of AT III, PC and PS deficiencies causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in the Trakya region of Turkey are higher than in other reported studies while the APC resistance is lower than in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies including more patients would be required to clarify these discrepancies </plain></SENT>
