<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The plasma AT III level (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity) was maintained at values in excess of 100% postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A mean dose of 0.74 u/kg (range 0.64 - 0.83) of AT III resulted in a 1% increase in AT III level after concentrate infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The half-life of AT III (mean 66 h; range 58-76) was shorter during surgery and in the early postoperative period suggesting an increased consumption of the inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At III antigen was consistently higher than <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity during the first 24 h after concentrate infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy was associated with the presence in the patient's plasma of an AT III fraction showing a slower mobility than the main AT III peak on two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A biological assay is preferred to an immunological assay in monitoring replacement therapy with AT III concentrates </plain></SENT>
