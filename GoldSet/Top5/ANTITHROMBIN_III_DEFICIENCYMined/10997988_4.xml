<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the molecular bases of familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> in eight French families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight mutations in the antithrombin coding exons were identified, seven of which were novel mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, individuals were heterozygous for the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found two small frameshift deletions in exon 3a, leading to type I deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five missense mutations in exons 3b or 5 also caused type I deficiency and their potential consequences on the antithrombin three-dimensional structure were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The last mutation in exon 4 was associated with a type II 'reactive site' deficiency: a dysfunctional antithrombin that is affected in its interaction with thrombin was present in circulation </plain></SENT>
