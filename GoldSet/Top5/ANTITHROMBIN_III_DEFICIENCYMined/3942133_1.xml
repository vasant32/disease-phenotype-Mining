<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a newly diagnosed family with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, with thromboembolic complications in the propositus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the propositus and his asymptomatic sister had decreased plasma levels of antithrombin III antigen and activity (28-52% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with good agreement between functional and immunologic assays) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The propositus developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, followed by massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> despite <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy and was treated with streptokinase and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> with excellent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Shortly thereafter, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235329" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">small bowel obstruction</z:e> required surgical intervention, and antithrombin III concentrate, recently available in the United States as an investigational new drug (I.N.D.), was administered with no postoperative thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was subsequently asymptomatic while on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> prophylaxis but twice developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> when he failed to take <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> therapy led to a sustained rise in the antithrombin III level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each of these therapeutic approaches is discussed and the literature reviewed with emphasis on the newer agents--streptokinase, antithrombin III concentrate, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
