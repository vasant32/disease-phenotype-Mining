<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients with anterior or posterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain attacks</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred healthy subjects matched for sex and age were randomly assigned to a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had a physical examination and radiologic work-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography showed no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> either with or without contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Digital angiography of epiaortic and intracerebral vessels was unremarkable patients non controls ever had war-farin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III, protein C and plasminogen were determined by functional methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Protein S was assayed by a functional clotting method based on prolonged PT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The activated protein C resistance test was performed and a poor response to activated protein C was verified in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings show protein S, protein C and antithrombin III type I deficiency with a functional activity &lt; 70% compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight of fifty patients (16%) had low protein S levels, 5 (10%) had low protein C, 2 (4%) had low antithrombin III and 1 (2%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398621" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">plasminogen deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant (p &lt; 0.01) difference in activated protein C ratio was seen for controls and patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that screening for natural <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> in young people suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> could be beneficial and should be encouraged </plain></SENT>
