<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fibrinolysis and coagulation were studied in 10 neonates undergoing cardiac operations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Coagulation was activated during cardiopulmonary bypass as evidenced by highly increased prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 levels compared with preoperative values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 levels remained elevated until postoperative day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike coagulation, fibrinolysis was not activated during cardiopulmonary bypass but did show late activation on postoperative day 3, as evidenced by elevated levels of the fibrin degradation product D-dimer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lack of fibrinolytic activation during bypass and its appearance on postoperative day 3 were partly explained by changes observed in tissue plasminogen activator and its inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During bypass, levels of tissue plasminogen activator and its inhibitor increased by 3.4-fold and 3.2-fold, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the postoperative period, levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor normalized rapidly whereas tissue plasminogen activator remained elevated, resulting in late fibrinolytic activation on postoperative day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In accordance with elevated prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, platelet count, antithrombin III, protein C, prothrombin, and factor VII were decreased on postoperative day 2, indicating ongoing consumptive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had antithrombin III and six had protein C levels below age-specific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges, consistent with an acquired deficiency state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three had central <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> by postoperative day 4 or 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was preceded by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, and highly elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor (3.7 to 37 times the mean of the other patients) on postoperative days 1 to 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, cardiopulmonary bypass in neonates caused rapid and profound alterations in the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems and initiated consumptive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> lasting until at least postoperative day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thrombophilic abnormalities in antithrombin III, protein C, and fibrinolysis were frequently found and were associated with serious thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
