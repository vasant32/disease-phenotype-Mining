<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> in an asymptomatic individual (and family) with borderline levels (approximately 70% antigen and activity) of antithrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of amplified DNA showed a mutation in codon 135, AAC to ACC, predicting a heterozygous Asn135Thr substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This substitution alters the predicted consensus sequence for glycosylation, Asn-X-Ser, adjacent to the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> interaction site of antithrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antithrombin isolated from plasma of the proband by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> chromatography contained amounts of beta antithrombin (the very high affinity fraction) greatly increased (approximately 20% to 30% of total) above the trace levels found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of the residue 135 variant in both a cell-free system and COS-7 cells confirmed altered glycosylation arising as a consequence of the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> and variant protein were translated and exported from COS-7 cells with apparently equal efficiency, in contrast to the reduced level of variant observed in plasma of the affected individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case represents a novel cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e>, removal of glycosylation concensus sequence, and highlights the potentially important role of beta antithrombin in regulating coagulation </plain></SENT>
