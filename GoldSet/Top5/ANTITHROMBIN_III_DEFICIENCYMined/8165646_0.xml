<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This occurred in spite of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> concentrations of thrombin <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> present in the blood of the healthy subjects examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are several reports showing that in vivo increased thrombin-antithrombin III-complex (TAT) concentrations and relatively low FPA concentrations may occur e.g. in patients with (pre)thrombotic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These in vivo findings indicate more effective thrombin inhibition by antithrombin III, with almost no fibrin formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To find an explanation for the differences observed in vitro and in vivo, we extended the in vitro studies by measuring concentrations of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2), TAT and FPA at several time points until 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to test whether thrombin at least initially is neutralized by antithrombin III, resulting in a lack of fibrin formation, either in the absence or in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (0.2 and 0.5 U/ml whole blood, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the absence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> a simultaneous increase in the concentrations of F1 + 2, TAT and FPA was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thrombin was only partially neutralized by antithrombin III and large amounts of fibrin were formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> virtually suppressed thrombin formation since the F1 + 2 concentration remained low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the small amounts of thrombin formed were neutralized by antithrombin III to a greater extent than in the absence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
