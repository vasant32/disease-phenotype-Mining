<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the identification of a new mutation resulting in type I antithrombin (AT) deficiency and the mechanism by which the deficiency arose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The single base substitution of G to A at nucleotide 2709 was identified in a proband with a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mutation results in a substitution of 82 Ser by Asn, creating a new glycosylation site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression studies were then carried out, to confirm Asn-linked glycosylation occurred at this consensus site and that this resulted in the AT deficient phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell-free translations using rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of microsomes demonstrated that the 82 Asn variant was post-translationally processed efficiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 82 Asn variant protein was of a higher molecular weight than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT. consistent with the addition of a fifth glycan chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incubation of translation product with endoglycosidase H, confirmed that the higher molecular weight product had resulted from additional carbohydrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of the 82 Asn variant in COS-7 cells resulted in intracellular accumulation, with a low level of secretion of the protein into culture supernatant, consistent with type I AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The addition of an extra carbohydrate side chain to residue 82 of antithrombin may block post-translational folding. trapping the variant intracellulary </plain></SENT>
