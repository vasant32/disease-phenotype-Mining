<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> and other thrombophilic factors as risk factors in the development of PVT in the pediatric age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From March 2001 to January 2002, 40 children with PVT were enrolled in the study, in addition to 20 age-matched and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, and activated protein C resistance (APCR) were assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular study of factor II and factor V mutations was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 25 had detectable hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (62.5%), 12 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> (30%), 11 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> (27.5%), 6 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1610621" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor II mutation</z:e> (15%), 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> (2.5%), and none had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five children had concurrence of more than one defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> is the most common hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> associated with PVT and the relative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>, as a cause of PVT, was six times more than in controls (odds ratio=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concurrence of more than one hereditary thrombophilic factor was seen in 12.5% of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Circumstantial risk factors (neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, umbilical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, umbilical catheterization) were not more significantly prevalent among patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> than among those with no detectable abnormalities in anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
