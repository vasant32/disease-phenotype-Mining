<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III is a major inhibitor of thrombin and augmentation of its inhibitory actions by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is the basis for the clinical uses of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that another <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18376">dermatan sulfate</z:chebi>, is an effective antithrombotic drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="18376">Dermatan sulfate</z:chebi> catalyses the inhibition of thrombin by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II are higher in the plasmas of individuals with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> and pregnant women than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II as a physiologic thrombin inhibitor is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to quantify thrombin-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II and thrombin-antithrombin III endogenous to the plasmas of adult antithrombin III-Hamilton deficient subjects, their siblings with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antithrombin III levels, pregnant women at term and 3 to 5 days after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both thrombin-antithrombin III and thrombin-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II complexed with vitronectin were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the plasmas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly, the concentrations of thrombin-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II-vitronectin were higher in the plasmas of congenital antithrombin III deficient subjects and in pre- and post-delivery plasmas than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the concentrations of thrombin-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II decreased 3 to 5 days after delivery, reflecting the disappearance of the catalytically active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18376">dermatan sulfate</z:chebi> elaborated by the placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II normally inactivates thrombin in vivo, with its role increasing in conditions associated with high levels of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18376">dermatan sulfate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
