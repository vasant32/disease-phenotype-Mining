<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The intrinsic thrombogeneity of stents was the historic limitation to their usage during the early phases of stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk of stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has been minimized by the widespread use of platelet antiaggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nowadays, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is around 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic risk depends on several factors, such as type of stent, complexity of lesion, and clinical picture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We present a case of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> in-stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in a patient with mild antithrombin III (AT) deficiency despite the combined administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> and aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our patient, several factors, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, AT deficiency, and the use of a paclitaxel-eluting stent, have contributed to the development of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although we were not able to identify the culprit factor, we should keep in mind that the deployment of a drug-eluting stent could be unsafe if it is not supported by a clear clinically oriented pathway that considers the overall condition of the patient since, in some cases, neither coronary lesions nor coronary stents are responsible for the negative outcome of patient therapy, which may be caused instead by incomplete or inadequate patient assessment </plain></SENT>
