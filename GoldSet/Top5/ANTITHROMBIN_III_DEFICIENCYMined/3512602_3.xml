<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels were: AT-III ag, 0.92-0.96 U/ml; AT-III <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity, 0.54-0.62 U/ml; progressive antithrombin activity index, 0.13-0.18; anti-Xa activity, 0.50-0.56 U/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) patterns performed with and without added <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but serum CIE revealed a decreased complex peak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Purification of the patient's plasma AT-III by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">sepharose</z:chebi> affinity chromatography showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> protein recovery and elution profile, but the purified AT-III fraction showed only 50% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progressive thrombin neutralization and anti-Xa activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes were formed by incubating with excess thrombin, <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis revealed that half the patient AT-III formed TAT complexes while the remainder migrated as free AT-III </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient's nonreacting AT-III (AT-III "Denver"), isolated by affinity chromatography, showed CIE and <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE migration patterns characteristic of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT-III but failed to bind thrombin or Xa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calculations from turnover studies in one patient and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects with autologous 131I-AT-III suggested that AT-III "Denver" is removed from the plasma slightly more rapidly than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that the patients' variant AT-III molecule was characterized by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> interaction but defective binding and inhibition of thrombin and Xa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These characteristics allow isolation of the nonreactive variant molecule by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">sepharose</z:chebi> affinity chromatography </plain></SENT>
