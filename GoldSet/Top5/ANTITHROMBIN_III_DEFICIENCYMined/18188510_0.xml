<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The causes and the effects of this phenomenon are not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the study is to evaluate the relationship of AT postoperative values on short and mid-term outcome after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January and June 2005, 405 patients, who underwent cardiac operations at our Institution had AT values available preoperatively and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, a cut-off equal to 63.7% for ICU-arrival AT was chosen in order to divide the entire population in two groups (117 patients with ICU-arrival AT &lt; 63.7%, Low AT group, and 288 patients with ICU-arrival AT &gt; or = 63.7%, High AT group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Objective of the study was to evaluate the predictive role of ICU-arrival AT &lt; 63.7% on in-hospital mortality and morbidity and on 18 months follow-up after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ICU-arrival AT was significantly lower than preoperative AT (90.7 +/- 16.3% vs. 71.2 +/- 15.1%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in the Low AT group were older, more often female, had a worse Euroscore and required longer CPB duration and cross clamp time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They had significantly higher preoperative and postoperative D-dimer levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ICU arrival AT &lt; 63.7% was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality but it was an independent risk factor for longer mechanical ventilation, need of inotropic support, excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and blood products transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ICU arrival-AT &lt; 63.7% was associated with worse survival during 18 months follow up (92.3% vs. 85.4% in the High AT and Low AT group, respectively, P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low AT after cardiac surgery is associated with higher incidences of peri-operative complications and worse survival in the mid-term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future studies should clarify the pathophysiologic mechanism of this findings and possible therapeutic directions </plain></SENT>
