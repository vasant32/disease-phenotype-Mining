<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This article discusses the management of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, as well as the use of antithrombotic agents, during pregnancy and is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Grade 2 recommendations are weaker and imply that the magnitude of the benefits and risks, burden, and costs are less certain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Support for recommendations may come from high-quality, moderate-quality or low-quality studies; labeled, respectively, A, B, and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for pregnant women, in general, we recommend that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> should be substituted with unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (UFH) or low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) [Grade 1A], except perhaps in women with mechanical heart valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For pregnant patients, we suggest LMWH over UFH for the prevention and treatment of VTE (Grade 2C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For pregnant women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> VTE, we recommend that subcutaneous LMWH or UFH should be continued throughout pregnancy (Grade 1B) and suggest that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> should be continued for at least 6 weeks postpartum (for a total minimum duration of therapy of 6 months) [Grade 2C] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For pregnant patients with a single prior episode of VTE associated with a transient risk factor that is no longer present and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, we recommend clinical surveillance antepartum and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> prophylaxis postpartum (Grade 1C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For other pregnant women with a history of a single prior episode of VTE who are not receiving long-term <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, we recommend one of the following, rather than routine care or full-dose anticoagulation: antepartum prophylactic LMWH/UFH or intermediate-dose LMWH/UFH or clinical surveillance throughout pregnancy plus postpartum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (Grade 1C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For such patients with a higher risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, in addition to postpartum prophylaxis, we suggest antepartum prophylactic or intermediate-dose LMWH or prophylactic or intermediate-dose UFH, rather than clinical surveillance (Grade 2C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that pregnant women with multiple episodes of VTE who are not receiving long-term <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> receive antepartum prophylactic, intermediate-dose, or adjusted-dose LMWH or intermediate or adjusted-dose UFH, followed by postpartum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (Grade 2C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For those pregnant women with prior VTE who are receiving long-term <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, we recommend LMWH or UFH throughout pregnancy (either adjusted-dose LMWH or UFH, 75% of adjusted-dose LMWH, or intermediate-dose LMWH) followed by resumption of long-term <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> postpartum (Grade 1C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We suggest both antepartum and postpartum prophylaxis for pregnant women with no prior history of VTE but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> (Grade 2C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other pregnant women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> but no prior VTE, we suggest antepartum clinical surveillance or prophylactic LMWH or UFH, plus postpartum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, rather than routine care (Grade 2C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For women with recurrent early pregnancy loss or unexplained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> loss, we recommend screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APLAs) [Grade 1A] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>For women with these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> who test positive for APLAs and have no history of venous or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, we recommend antepartum administration of prophylactic or intermediate-dose UFH or prophylactic LMWH combined with aspirin (Grade 1B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We recommend that the decision about <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> management during pregnancy for pregnant women with mechanical heart valves include an assessment of additional risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> including valve type, position, and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (Grade 1C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>While patient values and preferences are important for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> decisions regarding antithrombotic therapy in pregnancy, this is particularly so for women with mechanical heart valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>For these women, we recommend either adjusted-dose bid LMWH throughout pregnancy (Grade 1C), adjusted-dose UFH throughout pregnancy (Grade 1C), or one of these two regimens until the thirteenth week with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> substitution until close to delivery before restarting LMWH or UFH) [Grade 1C] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, if a pregnant woman with a mechanical heart valve is judged to be at very high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and there are concerns about the efficacy and safety of LMWH or UFH as dosed above, we suggest <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> throughout pregnancy with replacement by UFH or LMWH close to delivery, after a thorough discussion of the potential risks and benefits of this approach (Grade 2C) </plain></SENT>
