<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Binding of AT-III to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> dramatically increases its inhibitory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AT-III deficiency during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can lead to insufficient anticoagulation which cannot be treated by higher doses of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 60-year-old male with familial AT-III deficiency was admitted to our hospital for coronary artery bypass surgery and aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four days before the operation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53766,53768,53769">acenocoumarol</z:chebi> was stopped and anti-Xa nadroparincalcium (Fraxiparine) was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AT-III activity at that time was 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two hours before the operation, a single dose of 4500 IU AT-III concentrate was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heparinization was performed with 400 IU/kg of porcine mucosal <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, increasing the activated coagulation time (ACT) from a baseline of 115 to 549 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AT-III activity at that time was above 100% and the plasma D-dimer concentration was 230 ng/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ACTs during CPB remained above 999 s, whereas the AT-III activity dropped to 54% and the D-dimer increased up to 500 ng/l at the end of CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CPB was terminated uneventfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> was reversed with 3 mg/kg protamine <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, decreasing the ACT to 155 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the intensive care unit (ICU), the patientreceived prophylactic Fraxiparine and 1500 IU AT-III, increasing the AT-III activity to 84% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, there was continued blood loss, which necessitated the administration of whole blood and eventually re-exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The case presented illustrates an uneventful treatment of a patient with a hereditary AT-III deficiency undergoing CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In spite of an uneventful treatment with AT-III pre-CPB, administration of prophylactic AT-III concentrate after surgery should be considered with caution, as this might increase the postoperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
