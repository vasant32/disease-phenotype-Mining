<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 56 patients, 30 were male, 26 female, and the mean age of the patients was 43 years (18-65 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None had factor V mutation or activated PC resistance; 21 patients (37.5%) showed abnormal results: 4 (7.1%) had AT deficiencies, 6 (10.7%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiencies</z:e>, 6 (10.7%) PS deficiencies, 2 (3.6%) a combined PC and PS deficiency, and 3 (5.4%) LA and ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only PC and PS deficiencies were significantly associated with increased risk for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with an odds ratio of 4.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.2-15.0, P=0.018) and 8.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.6-40.6, P=0.003), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the prevalence of heritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (34.0%) in Taiwan is higher than that in Western countries, but that it is lower than previously reported in Hong Kong and Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We attribute this to selection bias </plain></SENT>
