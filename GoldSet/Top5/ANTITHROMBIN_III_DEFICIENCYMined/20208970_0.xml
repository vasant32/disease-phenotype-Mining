<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our article is to present our experience with a new type of retrievable "Recovery IVC Filter" with prolonged period of placement in the inferior vena cava (IVC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: "Recovery IVC Filter" was implanted in another department for a 27 year old patient with congenital deficiency of anti thrombin III with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (PE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 383 days from implantation of vena cava filter, the patient was indicated for removal of the filter from the right jugular vein access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Filter was removed with the help of a special extraction system without significant technical complications in our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On control phlebography after extraction of cava filter, there were no signs of injury to the wall of inferior vena cava, extravasation or stenosis </plain></SENT>
