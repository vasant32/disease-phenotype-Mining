<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the two patients who were tested, urinary concentrations of these proteins exceeded the plasma concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the urinary losses of plasminogen and antithrombin III decreased over the course of illness, the plasma concentrations of antithrombin III and plasminogen rose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had multiple thromboembolic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude the deficiencies of antithrombin III and plasminogen, probably secondary to urinary excretion of these proteins, may contribute to the thrombotic diathesis associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
