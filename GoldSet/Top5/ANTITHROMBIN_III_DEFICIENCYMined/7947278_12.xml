<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of the family history as a tool for the diagnosis of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several authors have indicated that a positive family history is not a good predictor of inherited abnormalities such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, or deficiencies of protein C or protein S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have tried to approach the family history in a quantitative way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To this end we used the cumulative incidence data of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the general population and also in a population of protein C deficient families to estimate the expected number of symptomatic subjects in a family under both the hypothesis of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and the null-hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although a number of assumptions underlying our calculations need to be verified and probably adjusted before any truly quantitative meaning can be assigned to this approach, we feel that the family history is a useful diagnostic test for inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> if it is used in a critical way </plain></SENT>
