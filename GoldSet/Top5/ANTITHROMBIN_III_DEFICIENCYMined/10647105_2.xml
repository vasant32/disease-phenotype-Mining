<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RPCA and deficiencies of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III were sought in 22 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005743'>Legg-Perthes disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two healthy children paired by age and sex served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of congenital prethrombotic disorders was not found to differ significantly among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005743'>Legg-Perthes disease</z:hpo> and among control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one patient had RPCA; this patient was heterozygous for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that unless more data become available, RPCA and deficiencies of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III should not be considered associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005743'>Legg-Perthes disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
