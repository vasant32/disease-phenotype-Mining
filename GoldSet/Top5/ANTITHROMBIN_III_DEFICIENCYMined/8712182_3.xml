<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors prospectively evaluated laboratory testing of this disorder over a 1-year period in their reference laboratory, which draws samples from a large number of community and academic hospitals throughout the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Testing for other inherited thrombotic disorders (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, protein C and S deficiencies) occurred at a six-fold greater rate than that for APC resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously published studies have indicated a prevalence of up to 60% for APC resistance in populations with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; however, the prevalence rate in this study was only 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of patient samples submitted for APC resistance assays, 37% were not evaluable because of concomitant <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical pathologists and practitioners need to be made aware of APC resistance and of optimal sample collection to improve the efficiency of laboratory testing for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
