<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a 43-year-old male patient with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> requiring haemodialysis due to extension of venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During dialysis with adequate heparinization, the patient often revealed clot formation in the extracorporeal circuit resulting in unexpected discontinuation of dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When either a combination of antithrombin III concentrate plus <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or the newly developed synthetic antithrombin preparation, MD805, was infused during dialysis, he could be uneventfully dialysed with either of the two regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The functional antithrombin III activity with MD805 increased to the same level as that obtained with antithrombin III concentrate, and it was possible to achieve an antithrombotic effect, as measured from the APTT and thrombin-antithrombin III complex with MD805 during and after dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We thus found that MD805 could be used as an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> drug when an AT III-deficient patient required anticoagulation in the extracorporeal circulation </plain></SENT>
