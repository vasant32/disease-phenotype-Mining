<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was determined that excess thrombin generation induced the marked acceleration of 125I-antithrombin III clearance from blood stream in consequence formation of thrombin antithrombin III complexes with the following limited proteolysis of the inhibitor by enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results give evidence that apart from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> the excess thrombin generation accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> play a part in the development of acquired deficiency of antithrombin III in this experimental pathology </plain></SENT>
