<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004448'>fulminant hepatic failure</z:hpo> have severe circulatory disturbances which may be due to fibrin and cellular plugs in micro-vessels which are a consequence of intravascular coagulation and which can lead to multiorgan failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since antithrombin III supplementation has been shown to be beneficial in animal models of septic shock with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo>, a controlled study was performed to investigate the effect of antithrombin III supplementation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004448'>fulminant hepatic failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients in grade III or IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> were selected on the basis of evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, intravascular coagulation and a high risk of developing multiorgan failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients received 3000 units of antithrombin III (Kybernin P; Behringwerke), followed by a further 1000 units every 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III activity increased from 0.26 +/- 0.04 SE U/ml to 0.82 +/- 0.07 U/ml at 3 h post infusion (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range 0.80-1.20 U/ml) and remained greater than 0.80 U/ml throughout the study without any apparent increase in the frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, survival was not improved and markers of intravascular coagulation remained similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, although the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004448'>fulminant hepatic failure</z:hpo> can be corrected by supplementation with antithrombin III concentrate, its use in the prevention of intravascular coagulation and to avoid microvessel plugging needs to be studied at an earlier stage in the disease </plain></SENT>
