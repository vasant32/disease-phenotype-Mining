<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In nine cases a consistent deficiency of antithrombin was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In five there was a reduction in the plasma antigenic concentration of antithrombin and in a further four cases deficiency was due to the presence of a dysfunctional antithrombin variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The variants have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> been characterized by DNA analysis and in three the mutations have been confirmed by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequencing (antithrombin Basel (41 Pro to Leu) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our series 5% of patients who presented before the age of 40 years had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e>, and 2% of the total number of patients investigated had a dysfunctional variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our figures indicate that a significant number of cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> are due to dysfunctional variants and that the true incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> in patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is in the order of 5% </plain></SENT>
