<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A study is presented which was carried out in twenty-five patients operated on in a surgical service, and who received total parenteral nutrition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Samples were taken to check modifications to the fibrinolytic system occurring after administration of hyperosmotic solutions, principally lipidic emulsions, from a contemporary standpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed three extractions: on day one, day five and following the withdrawal of the fat emulsion, with study of modifications to antithrombin III, alpha 2 antiplasmin, plasminogen, C protein, plasminogen tissular activator (t-PA), plasminogen tissular activator inhibitor (PAI 1), fibrinogen, and fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The laboratory techniques used are shown, along with the results obtained: increased for alpha 2 antiplasmin and antigenic t-PA with significant values (p &lt; 0.05) on the day of withdrawal in comparison with pre-PN values, plus increased values for plasminogen, fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products and t-PA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it is suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, along with reduction in C protein levels and increased fibrinogen and PAI 1 concentration predispose patients with t-PA release defects to thrombo-embolic complication </plain></SENT>
