<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the presence of the gene mutation of factor V, FV R506Q or factor V Leiden, responsible for activated protein C resistance, in DNA samples of 127 probands and 188 relatives from 128 families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The factor V mutation was identified in 18 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine families were available to assess the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> and the clinical relevance of combined defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The factor V and antithrombin genes both map to chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Segregation of the defects on opposite chromosomes was observed in three families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Co-segregation with both defects on the same chromosome was demonstrated in four families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one family a de novo mutation of the antithrombin gene and in another a crossing-over event were the most likely explanations for the observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In six families with type I or II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> (reactive site or pleiotropic effect), 11 of the 12 individuals with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> and the factor V mutation developed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median age of their first thrombotic episode was 16 years (range 0-19); this is low compared with a median <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of 26 years (range 20-49) in 15 of 30 carriers with only a defect in the antithrombin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of five subjects with only factor V mutation experienced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at 40 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In three families with type II <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding site deficiencies, two of six subjects with combined defects experienced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; one was homozygous for the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results show that, when <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurs at a young age in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e>, the factor V mutation is a likely additional risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Co-segregation of mutations in the antithrombin and factor V genes provides a molecular explanation for severe <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in several generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The findings support that combinations of genetic risk factors underly differences in thrombotic risk in families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
