<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we assessed the VTE risk associated with the phenotypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> in patients admitted to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that patients with type I deficiency (n = 21) had more VTE events and earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of VTE than those with type II deficiency (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The VTE-free survival analysis showed that the risk for VTE in patients with type I deficiency was sevenfold greater than that in patients with type II deficiency (hazard ratio: 7.3; 95% confidence interval: 1.9-12.2; P = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of type I deficiency in the VTE group (5.6%, 6/108) was higher than that in the general population (0.04%, 2/4,517) (odds ratio: 132.8; 95% confidence interval: 26.5-666.1; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence of type II deficiency was not different between the VTE group and the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study indicated that the risk for VTE in patients with type I deficiency was much higher than that in patients with type II deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, simple phenotypic classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> is useful for assessment of VTE risk in Japanese </plain></SENT>
