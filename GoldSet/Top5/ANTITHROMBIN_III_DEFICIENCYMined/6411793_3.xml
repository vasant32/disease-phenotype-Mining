<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven of 129 patients (5.4%) developed central vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> when TPN solutions provided less than 6,000 units (usually 1,000 units/liter) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the subsequent period when <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was increased to 6,000 units per day, 10 of 858 (less than 1.2%) patients developed a TPN-related <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (P less than 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
