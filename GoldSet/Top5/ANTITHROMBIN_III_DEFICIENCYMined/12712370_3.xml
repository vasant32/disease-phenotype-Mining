<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three patients were identified that met our criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first patient was discovered to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second patient was afflicted with afibrinoginemia, a protein C and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The third patient had been previously diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> and had an elevated ESR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each patient had a protracted course of symptoms before mesenteric disease was considered, confirmed by angiography, and treated by arterial bypass with/without bowel resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients survived and are currently asymptomatic at an average of 2 years postoperatively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e> in our study cases suggests the need for a search for such disorders and the possible need for long-term anticoagulation therapy as a deterrent to recurrence </plain></SENT>
