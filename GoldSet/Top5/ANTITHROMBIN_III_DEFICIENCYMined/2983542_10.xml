<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ATIII-deficient family members were identified on the basis of: (1) reduced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity and (2) the presence of an electrophoretically abnormal inhibitor molecule in their plasmas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Affected individuals have two copies of the ATIII structural gene, and both alleles appear <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at the resolution of whole genome Southern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, family studies revealed statistically significant cosegregation of ATIII-deficiency trait and a particular ATIII DNA polymorphism haplotype (lod = 3.35; theta = 0.0); this result is consistent with the presence of a dysfunctional ATIII gene on a chromosome of the +, S haplotype </plain></SENT>
