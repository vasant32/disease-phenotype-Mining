<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical history of 238 patients with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (AT III = 94, PC = 103, PS = 41) was analyzed retrospectively at diagnosis and in the follow-up period after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis 129 patients (54%) had suffered from <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, with a recurrence rate of 48% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> manifestation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> of lower limbs (58%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic history started before 40 in 80% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine percent of the venous thromboses were preceded by a triggering event, in most cases pregnancy (17%) and surgery (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After diagnosis, follow-up lasted a total of 1,113 pt-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A policy of short-term prophylaxis during risk situations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and long-term prophylaxis in symptomatic patients failed to prevent venous thrombotic episodes (diagnosed by objective methods) in 4 previously asymptomatic subjects and recurrence in 7 previously symptomatic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After knowledge of the patients' diagnosis the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>/100 pt-years was reduced as compared before diagnosis as total episodes (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>+recurrencies) (1.0 vs 1.9), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> episodes (0.7 vs 1.3) and recurrent episodes (1.3 vs 4.8), even though the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However most of the venous thromboses occurred at a more advanced age (67% after 40 years) and without any apparent cause (83%), at significant variance with the period preceding the diagnosis; in particular the incidence of venous thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in patients younger than 40 passed from 1.3/100 pt-years to 0.2/100 pt-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 6 recurrences after diagnosis a poor compliance for antithrombotic treatment was recognized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
