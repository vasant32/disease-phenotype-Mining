<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of the inferior vena cava (IVC) was present in 52 and PTE in 27 patients, The recurrence of phlebothrombosis was recorded in 40 (76.9%), that of PTE in 12 (44.4%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time elapsed between disease exacerbations accounted for one month to nine years, the number of recurrences constituted two to 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initially, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in three patients was located in lower limb saphenous veins, in 18 in the tibial and femoral veins, in 29 in the femoral and iliac veins; two patients presented with femoroiliocaval phlebothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recent control examination revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the saphenous veins in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In ten patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was located in the tibiofemoral segment, in 19 patients, it was discovered in the femoroiliac and in two cases, in the femoroiliocaval segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During observation period, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in the previously intact lower limb developed in nine (16.7%) patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these, seven patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the arteries of the upper and lower limbs: in four cases, it was located in the system of the IVC and in two cases, in the mesenterial arteries; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was recorded in two cases, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the portal vein in one, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was also marked in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In view of different hemostatic changes underlying the development of venous thromboses and PTE, we carried out differentiated therapy applying <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, platelet inhibitors, and transfusions of quickfrozed plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> femoroiliac and caval thromboses and PTE, 40 patients were provided implantation into the IVC of the cava filter &lt;&lt;volan&gt;&gt; </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After cava filter implantation 16 patients developed tnrombosis of the IVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Embolism to the cava filter occurred in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In three cases, it terminated in occlusion of the IVC and in the remaining cases, in its recanalization </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the course of phiebothrombosis and PTE in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> made it possible to define situations that require its goal-oriented search </plain></SENT>
