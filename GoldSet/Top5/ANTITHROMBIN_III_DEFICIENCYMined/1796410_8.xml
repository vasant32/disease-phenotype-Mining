<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order that a record is kept of the new and duplicated mutations that are found, we have compiled a database that we plan to update annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this, the first report of the database, we list 6 antithrombin III locus sequence polymorphisms and 94 recorded mutations causing functional deficiency of the protein, 38 of which are novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As is the case with mutations affecting other protein genes, most mutations of antithrombin III involve a CG to TG or CA change </plain></SENT>
