<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>F1.2 concentrations were not altered by exogenous factor Xa, thrombin, or thromboplastin if blood was collected by routine venipuncture into tubes containing <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> as <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (but not <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi>, acid-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="10" ids="4167">dextrose</z:chebi>, EDTA, or oxalate) and if plasma antithrombin III concentration was &gt; or = 30% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heparinized plasma F1.2 was stable for &gt; or = 8 h at 20-25 degrees C, and if premixed with a stabilizing reagent, for &gt; or = 4 years at -70 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean values for heparinized plasma F1.2 collected and stored by recommended procedures were increased in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and conditions of increased thrombotic risk, and were sensitive to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that plasma obtained by routine venipuncture into tubes with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> as <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> is an appropriate specimen for F1.2 measurements for most patients </plain></SENT>
