<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 3-year-old girl with multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo> was referred to our clinic for living-donor liver transplantation, the patient's father being the donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pretransplant evaluation revealed that the father presented partial asymptomatic antithrombin (AT) deficiency, with no inherited AT deficiency found in the girl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genetic testing showed an AT type IIb deficiency responsible for a defect in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-binding region of AT which is less thrombogenic but more common than the other AT qualitative defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Her mother was ABO incompatible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> on the father's side, transplantation was successfully performed under replacement therapy with intravenous AT concentrate and low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> thromboprophylaxis given to both the recipient and the donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No thrombotic complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the posttransplantation course, acquired partial AT deficiency was detected in the recipient, who received adjuvant chemotherapy without thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case report highlights the relevance of full thrombophilic work-up before liver transplantation from a living donor, while illustrating that the procedure can be successfully performed in the case of AT deficiency on the donor's side provided that appropriate AT supplementation and thromboprophylaxis are administered to both the recipient and the donor </plain></SENT>
