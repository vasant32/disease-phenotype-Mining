<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III (ATIII) deficiency has been implicated in adults as a predisposing factor to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; however, thromboembolic complications are rare in children with the same deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that because of the elevated levels of plasma alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) throughout childhood, plasmas of ATIII-deficient children inhibit thrombin more efficiently than those of ATIII-deficient adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 14 ATIII-deficient adults (ages 25 to 46 years), 13 ATIII-deficient children (ages 2 to 13 years), 9 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children (ages 3 to 15 years), and 16 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured thrombin inhibition in these plasmas, as well as the contributions of ATIII, alpha 2M, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II (HCII) as thrombin inhibitors in each plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>125I-alpha-thrombin, 25 nmol/L, was added to each plasma (defibrinated with Arvin at 37 degrees C), and 90 seconds later the free thrombin and thrombin-inhibitor complexes were quantitated after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, autoradiography, and densitometric scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma from ATIII-deficient adults inhibited significantly less thrombin (12.8 +/- 0.6 nmol/L) than both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults (16.1 +/- 0.3 nmol/L, P less than .01), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children (15.7 +/- 0.4 nmol/L, P less than .01), or ATIII-deficient children (15.5 +/- 0.3 nmol/L, P less than .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the total concentration of thrombin inhibited by ATIII-deficient children and either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, plasmas of ATIII-deficient children inhibited thrombin significantly more efficiently than plasma of ATIII-deficient adults (P less than .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the ATIII-deficient patients there was a significant correlation between the alpha 2M level and ability to inhibit thrombin (P less than .01), but no correlation between either ATIII or HCII levels and thrombin inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the addition of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (0.4 U/mL) to plasma, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four types of plasma inhibited thrombin to the same extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although ATIII was the predominant inhibitor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> heparinized plasmas, HCII inhibited more thrombin in the ATIII-deficient patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients (2.8 +/- 0.3 v 1.2 +/- 0.2 nmol/L, P less than .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the lower risk of thromboembolic complications in ATIII-deficient children may be due in part to the protective effect of elevated alpha 2M levels during childhood </plain></SENT>
