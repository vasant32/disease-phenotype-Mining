<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reported a 22-year-old young male who presented to our emergency department because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> after exercise </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other physical examinations were unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve-lead electrocardiography showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm with rate of 96 beats per minute, hyperacute T wave in V1 to V6 and II, III, aVF with reciprocal change in lead I, aVL </plain></SENT>
