<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As a major physiological inhibitor of thrombin and other coagulation proteases, antithrombin (AT) plays an important role in the maintenance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemostasis and its deficiency is associated with a predisposition for familial venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we found a novel mutation (13387-9delG) in the antithrombin gene that is associated with type I AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine the molecular pathologic mechanism of this mutation causing type I AT deficiency, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and the mutant AT constructs were expressed in COS-7 cells or Chinese Hamster Ovary cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No AT antigen could be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the conditioned media of cells expressing the mutant protein, and the AT antigen level was reduced in cell lysates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutant AT-expressing cells did not have less intracellular <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels than the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> transfectants as estimated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Metabolic and pulse-chase experiments showed the newly synthesized <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> AT protein was gradually secreted into the media, whereas no labeled mutant AT protein was detected in the media and the total amount of radioactivity was significantly reduced in the cells during the chase periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By immunofluorescence analysis, the staining of the mutant AT was weaker than that of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, and was predominantly diffuse without perinuclear enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the 13387-9delG mutation, which disrupts the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bridge Cys247-Cys430, impairs the secretion and stability of the truncated AT protein associated with intracellular degradation </plain></SENT>
