<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed changes in antithrombin activity, platelet count, and blood chemistry in 23 twin and seven triplet pregnancies in which the mothers received antenatal care and gave birth in our hospital during 1999 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both antithrombin activity and platelet counts gradually decreased until delivery, then promptly increased after delivery in both twin and triplet pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significantly larger number of women developed gestational <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> of &lt; 100 x 10 (9)/L (43% [three of seven] versus 4.3% [one of 23]; p &lt; 0.01) and pregnancy-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> of &lt; 60% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activity (57% [four of seven] versus 17% [four of 23]; p &lt; 0.05) in triplet than in twin pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight women with pregnancy-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e>, including three women with gestational <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, were significantly more likely to develop perinatal elevations of AST, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, and D-dimer than were those without pregnancy-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that women with triplet pregnancies are at an increased risk of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HELLP">HELLP syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> of pregnancy compared with women with twin pregnancies </plain></SENT>
