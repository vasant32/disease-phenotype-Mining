<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An abnormal AT III variant was found in five members from a family where a high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the affected subjects AT III antigen concentration was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, whereas antithrombin and antifactor Xa progressive activities as well as <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activities were low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Crossed immunoelectrophoresis performed either in absence or in presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further chromatographic investigations showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> affinity to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An abnormal plasma pattern was evidentiated by crossed immunoelectrofocusing throughout <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the AT III pH range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with the presence of an abnormal AT III variant with a defective binding to serine proteases and clearly identifiable only by crossed immunoelectrofocusing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This variant appeared different from the other qualitative AT III defects so far described and was named 'Antithrombin III Pescara' </plain></SENT>
