<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A girl with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor developmental delay</z:hpo> associated with an uncertain abnormality (detected by conventional karyotyping) in chromosome 10q had a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at the age of 35 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laboratory and radiographic examinations revealed antithrombin (AT) deficiency and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two concurrent chromosomal aberrations, inverted duplication and deletion in the 10q26 region and a microdeletion in the 1q24.2q25.2 region including the AT gene (SERPINC1), were identified by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both chromosomal aberrations were found to be of paternal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study described the concurrence of chromosomal rearrangements involving two chromosomes, and estimated the frequency of two or more chromosomal aberrations as 2-4% </plain></SENT>
