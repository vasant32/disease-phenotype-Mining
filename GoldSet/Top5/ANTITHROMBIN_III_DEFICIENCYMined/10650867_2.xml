<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to treatment of the underlying disease, consumption <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> was previously treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nowadays it is treated by substitution of coagulation factors, especially antithrombin (AT) concentrate, alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this pilot study we administered AT concentrate (dosage 80 U/kgbw/d), without additional <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment, to 29 children beyond infancy with acquired AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin, platelet count, fibrinogen, PT, and APTT were assayed before and during the course of AT substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These coagulation parameters returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 48 hours after normalisation of the plasma AT level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AT levels normalised within 24 h of initial substitution in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lethal outcome due to the underlying disease was observed in only two children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Data of this pilot study suggest that, concomitantly with the treatment of the underlying disease, consumption <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> in childhood can be managed successfully with early substitution of AT concentrate </plain></SENT>
