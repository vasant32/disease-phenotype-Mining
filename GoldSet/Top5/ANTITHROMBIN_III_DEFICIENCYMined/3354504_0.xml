<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cross-reactivity of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II (HC II) in assays of AT-III may, in some cases, interfere with the ability to diagnose hereditary deficiency of AT-III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For that reason, we have evaluated the interference by HC II in the new DuPont <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aca</z:e> antithrombin assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response of the assay to purified AT-III and HC II was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the bovine thrombin in the assay was sixfold less per molecule of HC II than of AT-III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This level of selectivity should be adequate to prevent misdiagnosis of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of patient samples showed close correlation (r = 0.91) of values from the automated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aca</z:e> assay with those of a manual assay (Coatest antithrombin, Helena Laboratories) </plain></SENT>
