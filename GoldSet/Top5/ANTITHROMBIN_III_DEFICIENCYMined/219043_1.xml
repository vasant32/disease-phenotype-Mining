<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These findings include: (a) inhomogeneous density of the inferior vena cava, usually best demonstrated after contrast medium injection; (b) caval density less than aortic density; (c) rim enhancement which may be seen with both caval <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion; and (d) enlargement of the vena cava if accompanied by at least one or more of the above findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A bolus injection of contrast medium followed immediately by CT helps to make some of the above described findings more prominent </plain></SENT>
