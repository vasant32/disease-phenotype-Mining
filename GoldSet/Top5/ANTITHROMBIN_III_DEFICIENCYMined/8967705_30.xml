<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been reported that women with an inherited deficiency of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S have an increased risk for developing venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> during pregnancy and the postpartum period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, because the available data on risk are flawed, it is difficult to define a rational, efficacious, and safe policy about prophylaxis for venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in these women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> during pregnancy and the postpartum period in women with heritable deficiencies of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University outpatient clinics in the Netherlands and Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 129 otherwise asymptomatic female family members of patients with a history of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and an established deficiency of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Medical history, with specific attention to episodes of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and obstetric history, was taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> factor status of the study participants was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If a patient had an episode of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, subsequent pregnancies in that patient were not analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 129 women who participated in the study, 60 had <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> factor deficiency and 69 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the nondeficient group, 198 pregnancies occurred; 1 of these (0.5%) was complicated by an episode of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> during the postpartum period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the deficient group, 169 pregnancies occurred; 7 of these (4.1%) were complicated by an episode of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> during the third trimester of pregnancy (2 pregnancies [1.2%]) and the postpartum period (5 pregnancies [3.0%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The risk for venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was increased eightfold in deficient women compared with nondeficient women (hazard ratio, 8.0 [95% CI 1.2 to 184]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> factor-deficient women have an increased risk for venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> during pregnancy and the postpartum period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although data from an appropriate randomized clinical trial are lacking, the frequency of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> seen in deficient women might justify the use of anticoagulative prophylaxis during the third trimester of pregnancy and the postpartum period </plain></SENT>
