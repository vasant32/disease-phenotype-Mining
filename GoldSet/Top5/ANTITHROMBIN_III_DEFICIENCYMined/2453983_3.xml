<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No patient given AT III concentrate alone or in combination with other methods had signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the 29 operations without prophylaxis there were three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, one with clinical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> and another with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But as the selection criteria for thromboprophylaxis are difficult to evaluate, a prospective study should be of great value </plain></SENT>
