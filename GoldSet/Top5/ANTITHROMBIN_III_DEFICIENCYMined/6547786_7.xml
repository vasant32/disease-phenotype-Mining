<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An assay measuring the thrombin inactivating effect of human plasma in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18376">dermatan sulfate</z:chebi> (DS) is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Test plasma, diluted 1/50, is incubated with human thrombin in the presence of DS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Remaining thrombin is determined with chromogenic substrate 2AcOH  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>H-D-CHG-Ala-Arg-pNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three dilutions of reference plasma suffice and the standard curve is linear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III (AT) exerts a small (3-8%) effect in the assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When test plasma contains <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> above 0.05 U/ml, this unspecific effect of AT increases, but it may be abolished by antibodies against AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> material (n = 50), the SD of DS cofactor activity was greater (15%) than that of AT (8.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DS cofactor was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in hereditary AT deficiency and in 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, both inhibitors were markedly depressed, to similar degrees (r = 0.84) </plain></SENT>
