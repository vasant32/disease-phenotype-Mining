<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) are at an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Potential responsible mechanisms include the disease process itself, treatment with chemotherapeutic agents (particularly L-Asparaginase [ASP]), or a combination of the disease and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied thrombin regulation in 26 consecutive children with ALL and 14 healthy age-matched controls by: (1) plasma concentrations of prothrombin; (2) plasma inhibition of 125I-alpha-thrombin; and (3) four biochemical markers of in vivo thrombin activation (thrombin complexed to its inhibitor antithrombin III [ATIII; TAT], prothrombin fragment 1.2 (F1.2), activated protein C complexed to the inhibitors alpha 1 antitrypsin [APCAT]), and protein C inhibitor (APC-PCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements were made at presentation before treatment, after treatment with ASP alone, and during combination chemotherapy with and without ASP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At presentation, the capacity to generate thrombin (reflected by plasma prothrombin concentrations) and the capacity to inhibit thrombin (125I-alpha-thrombin--inhibitor complex formation) were similar in children with ALL compared with that for healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After ASP alone or as part of combination chemotherapy, prothrombin levels were preserved, whereas plasma inhibition of 125I-alpha-thrombin decreased significantly because of a decrease in plasma concentrations of inhibitors, most importantly ATIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After combination chemotherapy without ASP, plasma concentrations of ATIII and the capacity to inhibit 125I-alpha-thrombin returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values, whereas prothrombin levels increased above control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thrombin generation in vivo also differed from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At presentation, plasma concentrations of three of four markers of in vivo thrombin activity (TAT, F1.2, APCAT, but not APC-PCI) were increased in children with ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither ASP alone nor combination chemotherapy with or without ASP significantly altered values of these three markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, although the in vitro capacity to generate thrombin was preserved, the in vitro capacity to inhibit 125I-alpha-thrombin decreased after ASP therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Evidence for increased endogenous thrombin generation was documented in children with ALL at presentation and throughout treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We speculate that poor regulation of this thrombin may contribute to thrombotic complications in children with ALL </plain></SENT>
