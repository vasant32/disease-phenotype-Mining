<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) has been considered for a long time a limited clinical condition of low importance, but this approach has changed in recent years, when several studies demonstrated that extension to deep veins occurs in 7.3 to 44% of patients, with high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of inherited deficiency of natural coagulation inhibitors in patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo>, and to understand their role in extension to deep veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 83 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>, without clinically obvious risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound examination was performed, and deficiencies of Protein C, Protein S and Antithrombin (AT) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the patients where <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> occurred in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> veins, coagulation inhibitor deficiencies were 6.45% in the absence of extension and 62.5% in patients with extension to deep veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicose vein</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>, the presence of these factors was less evident, but their prevalence was considerably higher in those with extension to deep veins (36.3%) than in non-extension (6.06%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Present data confirm the role of inherited thrombophilic states related to inhibitor deficiency, considering them as risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an association has been found between their presence and the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> to deep veins </plain></SENT>
