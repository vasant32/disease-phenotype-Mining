<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> was accompanied by the activation of blood coagulation and appearance of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> due to its loss with the urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The replacement therapy by bovine antithrombin III at a dose of 25 U/kg a day for 10 days decreased the signs of excessive thrombinogenesis in experimental animals and increased the amount of thrombin-antithrombin III complexes in the blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activation of coagulation in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> predominantly induced the disturbances of the excretory renal function which could be efficiently corrected by antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
