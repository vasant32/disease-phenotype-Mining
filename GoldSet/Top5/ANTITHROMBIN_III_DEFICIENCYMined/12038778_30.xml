<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little conclusive information is available on the actual risk of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> during pregnancy or puerperium in women with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, particularly in carriers of factor V Leiden and of the G20210A prothrombin gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the pregnancy-related and puerperium-related risk of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in women with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, we performed a case-control study on 119 women who had a first episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> during pregnancy or puerperium and 232 healthy women who had at least one pregnancy without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 47 patients (39.5%) and 15 controls (6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was 10.6 (95% CI, 5.6-20.4) for heterozygous carriers of factor V Leiden, 2.9 (95% CI, 1.0-8.6) for heterozygous carriers of the prothrombin mutation and 13.1 (95% CI, 5.0-34.2) for those with antithrombin, protein C or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> taken together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight of the 119 women (57%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after delivery, confirming the puerperium as a particularly high-risk period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When women were divided into two groups of those with antenatal or postnatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>. the relative risks associated with each type of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> were of similar magnitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, women with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> have an increased risk of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among thrombophilic abnormalities, the prothrombin mutation was the weakest risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> occurred more frequently in puerperium than in pregnancy, whether or not <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
