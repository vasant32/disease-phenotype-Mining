<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other disturbances demonstrated were related to fibrinolysis frequently, and rarely platelet function and coagulation factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Possible existence of these anomalies requires investigation during biologic tests in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, particularly in the presence of a family history or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the initial affection before 40 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of the importance of screening for such anomalies is supplied by results of a study of 11 families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> and 9 families deficients in protein C, and a literature review of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, currently available biologic tests provide data enabling only partial explanation of the mechanism underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> accidents </plain></SENT>
