<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the pathogenesis of fibrinolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, antithrombin III (AT III) activity, prothrombin fragment (F1 + 2) and d-dimer (D-DI) were measured in 50 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> and in 17 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 4 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> were randomly assigned to receive either an intravenous infusion of AT III (at two different dosages) or placebo, with a crossover design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of D-DI were detected in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> in comparison both with control subjects and with patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation was observed between AT III and D-DI (r = -0.755, P &lt; 0.001, simple linear regression), while no correlation was found between D-DI or AT III and F1 + 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation of the deficiency of AT III activity by infusion of human AT III did not result in any significant change (P0.10, analysis of variance for repeated measures) of the plasma concentration of either D-DI or F1 + 2, in comparison to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, advanced forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and mild forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, are associated with increased plasma concentrations of markers of fibrinolysis, which are inversely correlated with AT III activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the correction of the deficient AT III activity does not affect the plasma concentration of either D-DI or F1 + 2, thence not supporting the hypothesis that enhanced fibrinolysis in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> is the result of low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
