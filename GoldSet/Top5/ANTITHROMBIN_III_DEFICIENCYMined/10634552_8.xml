<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The role of decreased levels of protein C, protein S and antithrombin III were investigated in patients with branch and central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five patients with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion and 20 healthy subjects as a control group was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (31%) had central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion and 31 (69%) had branch <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of protein C, protein S and antithrombin III were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma levels of protein C, protein S and antithrombin III were not reduced in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of the 14 central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion cases and 3 of the 31 retinal branch vein occlusion cases had decreased levels of protein C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of the 14 central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion cases and 1 of the 31 retinal branch vein occlusion cases had decreased levels of protein S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III was reduced in 1 patient of the 31 retinal branch vein occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found statistically significant differences for number of cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> between the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion cases and the branch <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion cases (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Deficiency of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> proteins, especially protein C, may play a role in the etiology of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Measurement of these parameters may be useful in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> elsewhere in the body </plain></SENT>
