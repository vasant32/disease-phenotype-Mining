<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 34-year-old Korean man who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) in his right leg without precipitating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On outpatient evaluation, coagulation tests without anticoagulation revealed a decreased AT III activity level at 48%, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT III antigen level at 103%, indicating type II AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Family studies revealed that his father (62 years of age) had decreased AT activity (48%) but had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT antigen levels (116%), indicating that the proband had a paternally inherited type II AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of the SERPINC1 gene in the patient and his father revealed a heterozygotic missense mutation, a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi> substitution at nucleotide position 235 in exon 2 of the SERPINC1 gene (p.Arg79Cys) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report of Arg79Cys heterozygote mutation in family members with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
