<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors detected AT III deficiency in two patients with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients were otherwise healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One had recurrent <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the other cilioretinal occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To the authors' knowledge, only one case of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessel occlusion with AT III deficiency has been reported in literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the patients reported here <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessel occlusion may have been caused by AT III deficiency, which has considerable therapeutic and prophylactic consequences for patients with this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AT III should therefore be determined in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessel occlusion of unknown cause </plain></SENT>
