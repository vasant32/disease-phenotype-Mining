<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She reported to have suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> of the lung and a non-A-non-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> five years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiography of the aorta thoracica revealed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">complete obstruction</z:e> of the left arteria (a.) subclavia, stenosis of the a. carotis communis on both sides, of the a. carotis interna and the a. vertebralis on the left side as well as a non-detectable perfusion of the upper and medium segment of the left lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ESR was elevated with 89/128 mm n.W., a hypochromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo>, hypalbuminaemia, elevation of alpha 2 and gammaglobulins in serum as well as a reduced quick value were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AT III and protein C concentrations in plasma were also decreased, whereby protein C activity was reduced additionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HLA-B-51 was positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s arteriitis was diagnosed by us </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As this therapy was not associated with a normalization of protein C and AT III concentrations in plasma, protein C and AT III deficiency could be of significance in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s arteriitis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Until now protein C and AT III deficiency were not described in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s arteriitis </plain></SENT>
