<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-five healthy pregnant women (control group) and 34 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HELLP">HELLP syndrome</z:e> (study group) were included in the study between April 2007 and January 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> levels and activities of protein C, protein S and antithrombin III of the groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>, prothrombin 20210A mutation and C677 T mutation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase gene were also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Frequencies of thrombophilic gene mutations of the two groups were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protein C and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiencies</z:e> of the two groups were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>Antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> was statistically higher in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HELLP">HELLP syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were higher in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HELLP">HELLP syndrome</z:e>; however, there was no positive relationship between hereditary thrombophilic mutations and the disease </plain></SENT>
