<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recurrent fetal loss (RPL) is one of the most common cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterility</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> as the principal cause of recurrent pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, reported studies often do not evaluate other causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> in their inclusion and exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>So the aim of our study was to investigate the role of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in patients with RPL and without other causes of RPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with 2 or more first trimester abortion or with 1 or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> loss were considered for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the causes of RPL we looked for chromosomal, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory, and infectious alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>90 patients affected by unexplained RPL were enrolled and tested for hemostatic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These women were tested for inherited and/or acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> by MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism, factor V Leiden gene polymorphism, PTHRA20210G gene polymorphism, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, and anticardiolipin antibodies Ig G and Ig M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Acquired and/or inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> are strongly associated with RPL when other common causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>78% of tested women showed hemostatic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Several women with combined thrombophilic defects were also identified by our data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After a thorough evaluation of other causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> women affected by RPL should be tested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrated 78% of women with one or combined thrombophilic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Differences with previous studies should be related to difference in the inclusion and exclusion criteria and ethnic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because these patients often also show a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e>, it an antithrombotic treatment before and during pregnancy may improve their clinical outcome (ie, secondary prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> and primary thromboprophylaxis) </plain></SENT>
