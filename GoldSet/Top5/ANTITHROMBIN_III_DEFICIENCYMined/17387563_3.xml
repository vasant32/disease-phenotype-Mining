<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enhanced computed tomography showed segmental dilation of the small intestine, wall thickening, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo>, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and portal vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, an emergency laparotomy was performed, which revealed segmental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241950" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal infarction</z:e> caused by the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the SMV and portal vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We resected the necrosed intestine and performed anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was given intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and nafamostat mesilate as anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> again recurred 4 days after this operation, necessitating a second laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Segmental <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> of the intestine was found and another resection was done, after which he recovered rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood chemistry subsequently revealed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, which was confirmed to be inherent, after screening his family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, laboratory testing for these proteins may help define the cause of mesenteric <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
