<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A mutated AT cDNA expression plasmid ATM2759 was constructed by mega-primer method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ATM2759 and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> AT cDNA expression plasmid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ATN</z:e> were transfected into COS7 cells or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells by using Superfect reagent respectively for in vitro expression study and immunofluorescence assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The antigen levels of AT (AT:Ag) in the cell lysate of ATM2759 transfected COS7 cells and the cell culture supernatant were 174.97% and 35.63% of that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ATN</z:e> transfected COS7 cells respectively, whereas the AT activity in the cell culture supernatant was 47.73% of the control's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the fluorescence intensity was significantly higher in ATM2759 transfected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells than in those transfected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ATN</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Leu99Phe substitution may not affect the binding capacity of AT with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secretion defect and intracellular accumulation of the mutated AT protein might be the mechanisms of this mutation causing AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
