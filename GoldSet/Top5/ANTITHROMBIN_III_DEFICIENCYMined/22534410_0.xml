<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although failure to achieve an adequate activated coagulation time (ACT) after full heparinization before cardiopulmonary bypass often is attributed to antithrombin (AT) deficiency, it remains unclear if this is a causative mechanism of decreased <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the authors determined the relationship between AT and other coagulation-related factors that affect the ACT measurement and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> sensitivity index before the establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Adult elective cardiac surgical patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Preoperative data collection included demographics, type of preoperative medical therapy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, platelet count, and AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative measurements included ACT and anti-Xa activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 203 patients enrolled in this study, 10% (n = 21) did not achieve an adequate ACT (â‰¥400 seconds) after full heparinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subnormal AT activity (55%-79%) was not related to a low ACT and a low <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> sensitivity index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preoperative low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy did not cause a decreased ACT response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, preoperative low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels and high platelet counts were associated with a decreased ACT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these observations suggest that failure to achieve an adequate ACT is, in general, not an indicator of AT deficiency but could be affected by high platelet counts and low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
