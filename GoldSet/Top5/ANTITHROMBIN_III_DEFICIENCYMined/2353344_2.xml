<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Healthy pregnant women received 1500 units over 20 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial blood specimens were obtained over the next 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) activity elimination half-life of AT III was 29.4h +/- 3.4h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preeclamptic subjects had a mean baseline AT III activity of 70.5 +/- 2% (range 61 to 75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their activity eliminator half-life after 3000 units of AT III concentrate was 8.5 +/- 1.2h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a direct relationship between the pre-concentrate AT III activity level and the AT III activity elimination half-life (r = 0.79, p = 0.01) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based upon parameters calculated from the first infusion, the AT III activity of preeclamptic subjects was maintained by a constant infusion at approximately 100% for 96h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the conclusion of the infusion, the activity elimination half-life was again measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A dramatic increase in the activity elimination half-life was demonstrated (433.6h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the activity elimination half-life of AT III concentrate is increased during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy and further increased in preeclamptic women with an acquired deficiency </plain></SENT>
