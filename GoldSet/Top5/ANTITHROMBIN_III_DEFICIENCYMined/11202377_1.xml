<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood samples from 41 horses with severe colic and from 30 healthy control horses were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> was based on the findings of at least 3 of 6 abnormalities: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005542'>prolonged clotting times</z:hpo> (PT and APTT), increased polyclonal FDPs, decreased fibrinogen and decreased AT-III activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma thrombin-antithrombin III complexes (TAT), monoclonal fibrin degradation products fragment D (D-dimer) and monoclonal fibrinogen degradation products (FgDP) were also tested by using ELISA kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> was diagnosed in 16 of 41 horses with colic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to control and non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> colic values, TAT was significantly (P &lt; 0.000) greater in horses with colic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> (Control group, mean +/- s.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2.6 +/- 2; non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> colic group, 7.5 +/- 9, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> colic group, 30.9 +/- 36 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, D-dimer was significantly (P &lt; 0.000) less in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> group when compared to control and non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> colic values (mean +/- s.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>677 +/- 119, 682 +/- 220 and 399 +/- 234 ng/ml, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> colic values, FgDP was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> group (363 +/- 111, 437 +/- 230 and 293 +/- 187 ng/ml respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both PT and APTT showed a significant positive correlation with TAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> was more common among nonsurvivors and horses with ischaemic bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a hypercoagulative state was detected in horses with colic, which was stronger in horses with colic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hypofibrinolysis was present only in horses with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, marked hypercoagulation together with hypofibrinolysis are associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> in horses </plain></SENT>
