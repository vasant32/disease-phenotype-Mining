<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reference values for adult horses at 25 degrees C were 18-25 IU AT III per ml plasma and 84-118% AT III activity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> horse plasma, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Precision and accuracy were good (intra assay coefficient of variation less than 2%, accuracy 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical operations on healthy horses led to a biphasic decrease in AT III activity touching the lower border of the reference values on the second postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other reasons for acquired AT III deficiencies included <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using follow-up studies, differences in the dynamics of acquired AT III deficiency and coagulation promoting factors were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>12 of 35 horses with decreased AT III values suffered from phlebothrombosis of the jugular veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was presumed that acquired AT III deficiencies promote development and progression of phlebothrombosis/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> in horses </plain></SENT>
