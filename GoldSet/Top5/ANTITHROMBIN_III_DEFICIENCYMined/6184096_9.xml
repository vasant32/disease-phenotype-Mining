<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While 11 members had reduced plasma levels of both antithrombin-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor and antithrombin III antigen, the levels of antithrombin-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor were always greater than the levels of antithrombin III antigen: 66% (+/- 7%) and 49% (+/- 5%) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pooled <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma and plasma from one of the affected family members (60% antithrombin-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor and 47% antithrombin III antigen) were fractionated by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> affinity chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor, which eluted from <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> with buffer containing 0.4 M <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> and did not cross-react with antibody specific for antithrombin III and did not inhibit factor Xa at an appreciable rate in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, was designated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor, which eluted from <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> with buffer containing 2.0 M <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>, was functionally and antigenically identified as antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor A in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and patient plasma were similar (4.5 x 10(-7) M), while the concentration of antithrombin III in patient plasma (8.0 x 10(-7) M) was only 50% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (1.6 x 10(-6) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The functional properties of both <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor A and antithrombin III obtained from patient plasma were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the results of the present study it would appear that the antithrombin-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor concentrating measured in patient plasma reflects the combined concentrations of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor A and antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor A does not cross-react with antibody to antithrombin III, the concentration of antithrombin III antigen in patient plasma is thus lower than the concentration of antithrombin-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor </plain></SENT>
