<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine the effect of selective correction of antithrombin III activity on the increased turnover of fibrinogen, which occurs in patients with liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> supposedly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human antithrombin III concentrates were therefore transfused in seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> (less than 80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen half-life and the fractional catabolic rate constant were calculated from the turnover of 125I-fibrinogen which was represented by a two-compartment model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prior to antithrombin III transfusion, 125I-fibrinogen half-life was 76.7 +/- 15.2 h and the fractional catabolic rate constant was 0.33 +/- 0.11 of the plasma fibrinogen pool per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In six healthy adult controls these values were significantly different: 109.4 +/- 8.8 h and 0.19 +/- 0.01 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correction of antithrombin III activity with human antithrombin III concentrate reduced the increased turnover of radiolabelled fibrinogen to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 125I-fibrinogen half-life became 108.4 +/- 17.6 h and the fractional catabolic rate constant decreased to 0.23 +/- 0.06 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>decreased antithrombin III</z:hpo> activity contributes in an important way to the increased 125I-fibrinogen turnover in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and this might reflect intravascular coagulation </plain></SENT>
