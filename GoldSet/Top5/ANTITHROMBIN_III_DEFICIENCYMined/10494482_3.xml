<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 525 women (mean age 21.9 years, 73% aged &lt; 25 years) were examined before their first OC course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At first screening, completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results were recorded in 485 (92.4%) women, the remaining showing single (n = 34) or multiple (n = 6) alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At second examination (possible in 37 of 40), activated protein C resistance (APCR) was confirmed in 21 cases (4.0%, 18 with factor V Leiden), protein C, or protein S reduction in 8 (1.5%) and 2 (0.4%) cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The global estimated cost ($US) to detect one altered case was: $7795 for protein S, $2696 for antithrombin III (no case found), $1374 for protein C and $433 for APCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study confirms that extensive thrombophilic screening before OC treatment is not currently advisable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APCR assessment, however, seems to have a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio: the alteration is frequent and has a synergistic effect with OC; sensibility and specificity of some methods are good; family history is unreliable to single out possible carriers; finally, carriers can be fully informed of their increased thrombotic risk if treated with OC and can receive thromboprophylaxis during life situations associated with high thrombotic risk (e.g., pregnancy and puerperium) </plain></SENT>
