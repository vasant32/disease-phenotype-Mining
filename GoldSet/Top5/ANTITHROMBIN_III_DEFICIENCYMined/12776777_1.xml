<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most lead to a familial tendency to recurrent venous, not arterial, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, usually at a young age, and with spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the genetic defects known today affect the function of natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> pathways, in particular, the protein C system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, 602 (265 female, 337 male) patients with suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, arterial or venous, were referred to King Hussein Medical Center in Amman, Jordan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of hereditary deficiencies of antithrombin (AT), protein S (PS), and protein C (PC) were studied over a seven-year period (1993-2000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activated protein C (APC-R) resistance subjects were studied over four years (1996-2000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 30 years in females and 42 years in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis was established in 22.4% (n = 135) of the subjects (20.3% venous, 2.1% arterial) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>Protein C deficiency</z:hpo> was found in 3.8%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> in 2.3% and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> in 1.4% of our sample group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An APC-R problem was seen in 23.0% (n = 89) of the surveyed population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Out of the APC-R patients, 75.0% had the DNA analysis of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the subjects found to have the mutation 87.0% were heterozygous and 13.0% were homozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that APC-R, as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>, is the most prevalent cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> is related to venous, not arterial, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
