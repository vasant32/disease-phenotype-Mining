<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A family including 18 members with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>decreased antithrombin III</z:hpo> (AT III), measured with both a biological and an immunochemical method, is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pattern found on crossed immunoelectrophoresis, using <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> in the first run, was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, though the peaks were low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This suggests decreased synthesis of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> protein in the affected members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AT III deficiency occurred in both the paternal and the maternal branch, of the above 18 persons had had at least one thromboembolic episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of the episodes had been precipitated by the presence or occurrence of some predisposing event or circumstance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests the possible occurrence of a gene making some of the maternal family members more susceptible to certain trigger factors, such as surgery, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, pregnancy, and the puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> filled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic treatment, preferably oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>, is recommended for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persons with a low AT III concentration in any situation known to increase the predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in these patients is impaired since the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> co-factor, which is identical with AT III, is lowered </plain></SENT>
