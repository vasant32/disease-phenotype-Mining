<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported that recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhs-TM) is effective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) in vivo, in mice and rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we investigated the effects of decreased plasma antithrombin III (ATIII) levels on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> effects of rhs-TM, as compared to findings with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, of which effect is lowered by the decreased plasma ATIII levels in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rat plasma ATIII levels decreased when we mixed plasma with anti-rat ATIII antibody and the potential of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> to prolong APTT or PT was markedly diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The potential of rhs-TM to prolong APTT and PT was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In rats injected with anti-rat ATIII antibody, plasma ATIII levels decreased immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the rats were infused with tissue factor (TF), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At doses of rhs-TM and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> which were equally effective at inhibiting the decrease in platelet count and fibrinogen level in control rats treated with TF, only rhs-TM remained effective in preventing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> in rats with reduced ATIII levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> was not effective when administered to these rats with reduced ATIII levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, rhs-TM effectively inhibits coagulation independent of ATIII levels, in contrast to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, which depends on the ATIII level </plain></SENT>
