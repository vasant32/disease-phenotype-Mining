<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations affecting mobile domains of antithrombin induce conformational instability resulting in protein polymerization that associates with a severe clinical phenotype, probably by an unknown gain of function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By homology with other conformational diseases, we speculated that these variants might infect <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) monomers reducing the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infective polymerization of WT polymers and different P1 mutants (p.R425del, p.R425C and p.R425H) were evaluated by using native gels and radiolabeled WT monomers and functional assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human embryonic kidney cells expressing the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (HEK-EBNA) cells expressing inducible (p.R425del) or two novel constitutive (p.F271S and p.M370T) conformational variants were used to evaluate intracellular and secreted antithrombin under mild stress (pH 6.5 and 39Â°C for 5 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated the conformational sensitivity of antithrombin London (p.R425del) to form polymers under mild heating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions purified antithrombin London recruited WT monomers into growing polymers, reducing the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This process was also observed in the plasma of patients with p.R425del, p.R425C and p.R425H mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under moderate stress, coexpression of WT and conformational variants in HEK-EBNA cells increased the intracellular retention of antithrombin and the formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-linked polymers, which correlated with impaired secretion and reduction of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity in the medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mutations inducing conformational instability in antithrombin allow its polymerization with the subsequent loss of function, which under stress could sequestrate WT monomers, resulting in a new prothrombotic gain of function, particularly relevant for intracellular antithrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The in vitro results suggest a temporal and severe plasma <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> that may contribute to the development of the thrombotic event and to the clinical severity of these mutations </plain></SENT>
