<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the molecular basis for such deficiencies by asymmetric polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing of the seven exons and of the intron-exon junction of the AT III gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three different mutations were observed in the exon IV: a 4-bp deletion, a 2-bp deletion, and a nucleotide insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each of these mutations results in a frameshift introducing premature stop codons at positions 313, 309, and 232, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed by dot-blot analysis with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no mutation was observed in the other six exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The comparison of the type of mutations observed by our group in six cases of type I deficiencies and in 16 cases of type II <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding site variants deficiencies suggests that the former are caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> molecular abnormalities while the latter are caused by recurrent missense mutations </plain></SENT>
