<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirteen consecutive Japanese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) were studied for the incidences of antithrombin III (AT-III), protein C (PC) and protein S (PS) deficiencies, and the results were compared with those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 392 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Japanese subjects were found with PS deficiency (n = 8, 2.02%) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e> (n = 2, 0.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PS deficiencies comprised type I (1/8, 12.5%), type 11 (4/8, 50%), and type III (3/8, 37.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiencies</z:e> were type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among patients with DVT, 32 (28.3%) were deficient in AT-III, PC and PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients consisted of two AT-III deficiency (1.77%), nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e> (7.96%), 20 PS deficiency (17.7%), and one combined deficiency of PC and PS (0.88%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both of the patients with AT-III deficiency were classified as type II, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e> as type I, and those with PS deficiency as type I in 25% (5/20), type II in 55% (11/20) and type III in 20% (4/20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of PC and PS deficiencies in patients with DVT were 15.6 and 7.38 times the control population frequency, respectively, and this difference was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the Japanese population has a high frequency of PC and PS deficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We recommend that PS activity should be measured for screening of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> since type II deficiency accounted for approximately 50% of PS deficiency cases in both patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group in the Japanese </plain></SENT>
