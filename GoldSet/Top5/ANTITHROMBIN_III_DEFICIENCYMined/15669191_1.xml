<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with a history of unexplained abortion were enrolled as the investigation group for tests of protein C, protein S, antithrombin III (AT-III), as well as activated protein C resistance (APC-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of fifty healthy women with a history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy and delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were obtained for, measuring serum activity of protein C, protein S, AT-III, and APC-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with positive APC-R were tested for factor V (FV) Leiden gene mutation by PCR-RFLP method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 57 patients, 12 (21.1%), 1 (1.8%), and 5 (8.8%) cases were found with protein S, protein C, and AT-III deficiency respectively, and 13 (22.8%) cases with positive results of APC-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the control group, no protein C or AT-III deficiency was ever found, whereas 2 (4.0%) volunteers were presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> and 3 (6.0%) with positive results of APC-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No FV Leiden gene mutation was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with positive APC-R results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Late <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> cases had higher incidence of anticoagulation protein defect than the early cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anticoagulation protein defect may play a role in the pathogenesis of fetal loss, especially for those occurring in late stage of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
