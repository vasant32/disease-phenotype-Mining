<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After OLT, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> (international normalized ratio, 4.6) developed in a patient with ascitic losses of up to 12 L/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>hypovolemia</z:hpo> and severe systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">venoocclusive disease</z:e> in the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of this syndrome after OLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Coagulation studies were performed in 25 additional patients with large ascitic fluid losses after OLT and in 7 cirrhotic patients not undergoing transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> transplant recipients developed systemic deficiencies of multiple coagulation factors including antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Markers of prothrombin activation were significantly elevated in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> and serum in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and thrombotic complications subsequently developed in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 7 cirrhotic patients, markers of prothrombin activation remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or minimally elevated and thrombotic complications were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Massive ascitic losses after OLT may lead to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> from unreplaced losses of plasma coagulation factors into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> and accumulation of thrombin in the systemic circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>Hypovolemia</z:hpo> and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> should be corrected with fresh frozen plasma, which may prevent the development of thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
