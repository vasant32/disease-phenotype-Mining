<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Perforator ligation and saphenous vein stripping (PLSVS) healed 4/16 (25%) of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PLSVS and correction of deep venous valve incompetence healed 14/16 (87.5%) of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> (p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 32 months (8-62 mon) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This prospective comparison of the 2 surgical treatments (PLSVS versus PLSVS and correction of deep venous valve) demonstrated that disassociation of the superficial from the deep venous system with PLSVS and correction of the deep valve (valvuloplasty, transposition or valve transplant) produced promising results in the treatment of recurrent venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjunctive usage of elastic stocking and intermittent compression pneumatic boot to reduce swelling in the paraoperative period improved long term result in venous reconstructive surgery </plain></SENT>
