<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> was recognized by the venogram of his pelvic veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were scattered around his left ankle and accompanied by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0406500" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lipodermatosclerosis</z:e>, which was evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The propositus had developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> 12 years prior to his leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coagulation study showed low <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity of his AT with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of immunoreactive AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequence analysis of the exon 2 of his AT gene showed Arg47-Cys mutation, leading to the lack of affinity of AT for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
