<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight out of the 22 tested members of the family had reduced plasma levels of antithrombin III (AT III), the main physiological inhibitor of blood coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of them, aged 2-28 years, but no thrombotic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AT III deficiency, which was hitherto thought to be very rare in this country, appeared to be related to a reduced synthesis of the protein without any qualitative abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This view is supported by the concomitant reduction of AT III levels as demonstrated by biological and immunological assays, as well as by a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern of the protein in double-crossed immunoelectrophoresis with and without <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> added to the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long-term treatment with oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> appeared to prevent further thromboembolic episodes in two patients, even though plasma AT III levels remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
