<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the experience of the authors and propose therapeutic conduct in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the spontaneous losses of pregnancy related with these deficits were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-nine women, seventeen with ATIII deficit, fifteen with PC deficit and four with a deficit of PS and three with a plasminogen (Pg) deficit totalling 79 pregnancies and 51 thrombotic episodes sixteen of which were related with the pregnancy, delivery or puerperium were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antigenic and functional activity of ATIII, PC, PS and Pg were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> for the ATIII deficit during pregnancy was 39%, which was greater, of statistical significance (p = 0.046), than the 15% observed during puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In women with a deficit of PC, the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was 4.5% during pregnancy and 14% during puerperium with no significant difference between the two situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during pregnancy and postpartum in the deficit of ATIII was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.025) than that observed for the deficit of PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For women with a deficit of PS and Pg the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was nul in pregnancy and puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy and puerperium are situations which trigger thrombotic phenomena and increase the risk of the same in women with a deficit of antithrombin III and protein C and, to a lesser degree, the deficit of protein S or plasminogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A strict control of these situations and individualized treatment is required according to the type of deficit, presence of previous thromboembolic history and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> history at the time of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No increase in the risk of loss of pregnancy in any of the deficits studied was observed </plain></SENT>
