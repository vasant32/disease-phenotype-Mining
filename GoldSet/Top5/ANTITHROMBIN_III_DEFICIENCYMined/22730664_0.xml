<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Healthy volunteers including blood donors and individuals for routine check-up were recruited from 4 Chinese medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of PC, PS and AT activities were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of activities were measured by chromogenic substrate assay (AT and PC) and clotting assay (PS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 3493 healthy Chinese adults had been recruited in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Males had higher PS and PC activities than females, especially for PS (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PC activities increased with age in both sexes but decreased in men after 50 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change with age were of PS in 50 years old, while there was a decline in males and a rise in females above 50 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AT tended to increase with age in women but decreased with age in men after 50 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the age and gender, the general prevalence of PC, PS and AT deficiencies in the general Chinese Han population were 1.15%, 1.49% and 2.29%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PC, PS and AT activities have correlation with age and gender in Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reference range should be laid down and deficiencies should be identified </plain></SENT>
