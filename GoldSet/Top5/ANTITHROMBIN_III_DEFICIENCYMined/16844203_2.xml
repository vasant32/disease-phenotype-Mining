<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We expressed recombinant human antithrombin (rAT) in Chinese hamster ovary (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purified rAT is composed of 55% alpha-isoform and 45% beta-isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The structure of the N-linked <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> of rAT is the same biantennary complex type as previously found in pAT with less sialylated on the non-reducing ends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> of rAT are fucosylated at the reducing ends of N-acetylglucosamine, while those of pAT are not fucosylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite of the difference in sialylation and fucosylation of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> units, rAT and pAT showed indistinguishable <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor and progressive activities, and they bound to thrombin in a one-to-one stoichiometric manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS)-induced and thromboplastin-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> rat models, rAT reduced fibrinogen and platelet consumption to a similar extent with pAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In LPS-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> model, both ATs similarly restrained the increase of alanine aminotransferase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, pharmacokinetic analysis showed that both ATs had similar half-lives in the circulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, the present study demonstrated that rAT prepared in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells has potential for a substitute of pAT in therapeutic use </plain></SENT>
