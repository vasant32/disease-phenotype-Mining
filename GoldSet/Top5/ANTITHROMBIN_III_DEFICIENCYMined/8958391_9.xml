<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously identified a group of blood donors with inherited deficiencies of either antithrombin (AT) or protein C who appear to have a relatively low <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the 5 years that have elapsed since initial identification of these individuals, resistance to activated protein C (APC resistance), which is associated with the factor V Leiden gene mutation, has emerged as an important and highly prevalent inherited thrombophilic risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have followed 28 donors/relatives with deficiency of AT (median age 48 years, range 16-77) and 23 with deficiency of protein C (median age 44 years, range 15-79) over a period of 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the study period only one individual, who was previously symptomatic, has suffered a thrombotic event which occurred spontaneously whilst on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have now excluded coinheritance of APC resistance due to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> in our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that individuals with single inherited thrombophilic defects are not uncommon and are frequently asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The absence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> may in part explain the low <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> rate observed, and lends support to the hypothesis that multiple thrombophilic defects may be necessary for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
