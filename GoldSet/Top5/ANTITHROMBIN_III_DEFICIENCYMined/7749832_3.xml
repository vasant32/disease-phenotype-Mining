<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the effect of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> treatment on the early phase of tissue factor-induced coagulation, we measured plasma-activated factor VII (factor VIIa) levels by a direct fluorogenic assay in 74 cardiovascular disease patients on long-term oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We divided the patients into three groups based on the international normalized ratio (INR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the patients with INR ranges of &lt; 1.7 and 1.7 to 2.5, factor VIIa levels were 42% and 61% lower, respectively, than in age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factor VII coagulant activity (factor VIIc), factor VII antigen (factor VIIag), protein C, and factor X levels were also reduced to a similar extent in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with an INR &gt; 2.5, the factor VIIa level was not decreased compared with that at an INR of 1.7 to 2.5, although the factor VIIc, factor VIIag, factor X, and protein C levels were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> decreased further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the precise relation between the reduction of factor VIIa levels and the increase of INR requires appropriately designed long-term clinical trials, our data suggest that an INR range of 1.7 to 2.5 is sufficient for the suppression of factor VIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the long-term follow-up of three patients with congenital antithrombin III or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, the factor VIIa level was more responsive to changes in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> dose than the INR, and there were generally no corresponding changes of the thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, one patient showed a transient marked increase of factor VIIa during the discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> that was accompanied by an increase in TAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, factor VIIa could be useful for monitoring both hypercoagulable and hypocoagulable states </plain></SENT>
