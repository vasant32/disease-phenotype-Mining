<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When compared to values noted in 22 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight normolipidemic control subjects (31.54 mg/dl +/- 0.81), the plasma level of antithrombin III was slightly (p less than 0.05) higher in the 18 hyperlipidemic subjects (36.11 mg/dl +/- 1.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Owing to an extremely wide dispersion of individual values, the mean level of antithrombin III noted in 16 critically ill postoperative patients (28.16 mg/dl +/- 2.98) did not significantly differ from control values, although this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> was obviously decreased in those postoperative patients who developed multiple organ failure or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular-coagulation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, two subjects with familial deficiency in antithrombin III were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results provide evidence that the antiserum prepared in our laboratories is a useful tool for detecting acquired and inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiencies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
