<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A clearly subnormal AT level (below 60%) was found in 129 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In ten cases, this was explained by known (8 cases) or suspected (2 newborns) hereditary deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only in 5% of the 600 cases referred with definite or suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, AT was below 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cases had a <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> of about 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In about 30% of the cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, AT was below 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a group of 72 patients with either severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac insufficiency</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> or suspected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> for other reasons, AT was below 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also in this group <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> was about 50% despite lack of a clear <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> blood profile in 67 of the 72 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that an AT value below 60% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, unexplained by hereditary deficiency, carries a grave prognosis </plain></SENT>
