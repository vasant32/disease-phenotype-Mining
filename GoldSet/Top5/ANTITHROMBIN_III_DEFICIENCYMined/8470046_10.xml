<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENT POPULATION: Sixty-seven members of a large family with type 2 AT-III deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: DNA analysis was used as the reference diagnostic standard for AT-III status and subjects were classified as AT-III deficient or non deficient according to these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional AT-III levels were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects using: 1) a chromogenic substrate for thrombin and added human thrombin (AT-III-IIa), and 2) a chromogenic substrate for factor Xa and added bovine factor Xa (AT-III-Xa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II (HC-II) levels were measured using a commercially available kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportions of 125I-alpha-thrombin complexed to AT-III and HC-II were measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-one (46%) individuals were classified as AT-III deficient and 36 (54%) as AT-III non deficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AT-III-Xa assay measured a significantly lower mean AT-III value and a narrower range for individuals classified as AT-III deficient than the AT-III-IIa assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using the AT-III-IIa assay, six subjects had borderline AT-III levels compared to none with the AT-III-Xa assay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
