<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined, on admission, PC antigen (ELISA) and activity (chromogenic test), and total PS (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were expressed as % of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed with SAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty children were in shock, 20 had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, and 10 without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> were in shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 20 children who were in shock and had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, 7 died and 3 had an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PC antigen was significantly decreased in shock children (p less than 0.05), in children with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> (p less than 0.0005), and in non-survivors (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PC activity was significantly decreased in shock children (p less than 0.05), in children with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> (p less than 0.0005), and in non-survivors (p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total PS was not decreased in shock children, but was significantly decreased in children with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> (p less than 0.005), and in non-survivors (p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that PC and PS levels were decreased in our children, and that PC levels were significantly decreased in the presence of shock, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, and fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PC and antithrombin III (AT III) supplementation, should be evaluated in children with severe infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> with shock and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
