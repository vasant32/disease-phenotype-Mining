<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive retrospective study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed in order to collect data about maternal thrombotic complications and pregnancy outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women with known inherited AT deficiency and at least one pregnancy looked after at the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relatives with known AT deficiency but no pregnancies looked after in our institution were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen pregnancies were registered among nine AT-deficient women during 1991-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This cohort included women without antithrombotic treatment because AT deficiency was not known at the time of their pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 12 pregnancies (66.7%) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy with low-molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was given, while not in the other six (33.3%) because AT deficiency was not known at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three episodes of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were recorded (16.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pregnancies 10 suffered an adverse outcome (55.6%), including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> (11.1%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> (11.1%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> (33.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011419'>placental abruption</z:hpo> (6.7%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> (6.7%) and intrapartum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015930" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal distress</z:e> (23.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No relation between AT activity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A lower incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> was observed among women with antithrombotic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> is associated with a high risk of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> during pregnancy and the puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We also observed a high incidence of poor pregnancy outcome among AT-deficient women </plain></SENT>
