<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) is a common and potential serious complication in lower extremity surgeries, especially in hip and knee arthroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>Pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> is one of the most fatal complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recognition of VTE in the lower limb has been considered as an indication for anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many studies have shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> is one factor of VTE and the most common causes are protein C, protein S and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, factor V leiden and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011901'>dysfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VTE is a disease of Western populations because of well documentation of incidence and many studies about <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Thailand, the prevalence of VTE has been unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The present prospective study evaluated the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> after total knee arthroplasty in patients who did not receive prophylactic treatment of VTE in Phramongkutklao Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive prospective consecutive case studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Phramongkutklao Hospital, Bangkok Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Blood sample was examined at 2-3 weeks before TKA for measuring the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bilateral ascending contrast venography of the lower extremities was performed routinely between 6th-10th post operative days after total knee arthroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors studied 100 patients, 94 primary TKA and 6 revisions TKA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one (61%) were positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with positive venograms showed bilateral DVT twelve (12%) had a proximal DVT one was <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, nine were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, 18 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, and 36 were positive study for FDP(D-dimer), However, no one was found with factor V leiden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Odds ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> was 0.9506, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>Antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> was 0.7376, and FDP(D-dimer) was 1.229 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> and factor V leiden was undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients who have total knee arthroplasty performed are at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> rarely occurs in Thai populations, mechanical prevention was routinely used and prophylactic regimen should be a part of management of patients who undergo total knee arthroplasty </plain></SENT>
