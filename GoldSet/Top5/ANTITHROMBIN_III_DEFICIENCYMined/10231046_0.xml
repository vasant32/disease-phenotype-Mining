<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Hospital-based clinic for reproductive medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): A 27-year-old woman who was transferred to our hospital because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085083" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="OHSS">ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): Induced abortion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Antithrombin III activity in plasma and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): Antithrombin III activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> was slightly lower than that in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): The loss of antithrombin III into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> probably caused its deficiency in this case </plain></SENT>
