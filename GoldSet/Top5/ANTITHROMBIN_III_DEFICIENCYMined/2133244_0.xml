<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A linear response was obtained up to 1.5 U/ml and HCII levels were not affected by freezing and thawing the plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The assay was validated by comparing HCII and antithrombin III (AT III) levels in AT-III-deficient plasmas and samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Higher HCII levels were found in healthy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> women than in healthy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> men (means 1.16 and 0.97 U/ml, respectively, P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in HCII levels from 0.86 to 1.10 U/ml (mean values) was seen in healthy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> women starting on combined oral contraceptive (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COC</z:chebi>) preparations (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased HCII levels were maintained over a 6-month period, but fell towards <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 14 days after stopping <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COC</z:chebi>, although they were still significantly higher than before starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy in HCII level between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> men and women may be due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COC</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In clinical studies, different reference ranges should be used for men and women, and the need for careful questioning about the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COCs</z:chebi> is emphasized </plain></SENT>
