<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AT-III deficiency presents a rare hereditary or acquired disorder that most often comes to light when a patient suffers <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Triggers for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> include various mechanisms such as pregnancy, delivery, surgery, trauma, and contraceptive pill use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Decreased response to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> may be the first sign of AT-III deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is a conditio sine qua non for cardiopulmonary bypass, rapid consumption of AT-III promoted by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> may lead to systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> on graft patency after CABG in patients with AT-III deficiency, particularly with respect to early graft <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, has not been fully investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The early detection and timely treatment of this disorder may impact perioperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We present a case of simultaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of three venous grafts after elective coronary artery bypass surgery in a patient with AT-III deficiency </plain></SENT>
