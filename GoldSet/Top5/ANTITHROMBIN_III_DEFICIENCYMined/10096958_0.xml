<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activated protein C resistance is secondary to a point mutation in the factor V gene, factor V Leiden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of this mutation in the general population, mainly in Caucasians of European descent, is a major contributing factor to the high incidence of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> in the United States, affecting one in 1000 individuals annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heterozygosity and homozygosity for factor V Leiden increase the risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> 5- to 10-fold and 50- to 100-fold, respectively, compared with genotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factor V Leiden is more common than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other known genetic risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and its presence results in a compounded risk in patients with simultaneous inherited abnormalities such as protein C, protein S, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiencies</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e>, and/or acquired risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, detection of activated protein C resistance and genotyping for factor V Leiden are important for establishing risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and ultimately for patient management </plain></SENT>
