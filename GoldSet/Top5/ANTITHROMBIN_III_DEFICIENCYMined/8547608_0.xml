<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have reported previously the deficiency of AT III Kyoto in which there has been a single substitution of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi> for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> at codon 406 of exon VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This results in the amino acid substitution of methionine for arginine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide substitution at codon 406 in the mutant allele eliminates a Hae III restriction site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, Hae III restriction analysis of the PCR fragments in this family could segregate the deficient members from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> members, enabling the detection of the existence of Hae III restriction fragment length polymorphism of the PCR product (PCR-RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we confirmed by direct DNA sequencing with the polymerase chain reaction that the tested deficient members in an AT III Kyoto family inherit the same type of mutation in their genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Hae III PCR-RFLP can be a useful method for screening of this mutant gene in the family </plain></SENT>
