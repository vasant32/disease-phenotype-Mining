<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III (AT III) has been confirmed to play an important role as a serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> in the mechanism of blood coagulation, and its deficiency or abnormality is found to cause thromboembolic disorders by reducing the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper AT III gene of patient with congenital AT III deficiency, which was suggested to have qualitative abnormality by isoelectric focusing, was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the genomic structure by Southern blot hybridization with a cDNA probe (pAT6) revealed no detectable changes indicating any deletions, rearrangements and translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we focused to analyze the sequence of exon 6 of AT III gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods followed by direct sequencing analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequencing of exon 6 of AT III gene showed a G to T transitional mutation resulting in the conversion of arginine-406 to methionine coexisted with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele which encodes arginine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutation is located near the reactive center of AT III molecule, which region has been proved to be highly conserved during the evolution of serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> (serpin) family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From these results, it is concluded that the new type of mutation at amino acid site 407, which is similar to AT III Utah, is important for maintaining the structural and biological function of this inhibitor </plain></SENT>
