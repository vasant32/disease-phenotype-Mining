<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> is a devastating complication representing one of the major causes of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in plastic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within the scope of plastic surgery, body-contouring procedures are often considered to carry a higher risk of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> comprise a group of conditions defined by a genetic predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Collectively, hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> are present in at least 15 percent of Western populations and underlie approximately half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the topic of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> is discussed widely throughout the literature, there is little published on the diagnosis and management of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> in the plastic surgery literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The goals of this study were to present a review of the major inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo>, to delineate the risk of these disorders, and to recommend a practical algorithm for patient screening and management before major plastic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A MEDLINE search was performed from 1965 to the present to review the literature on inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on the English language literature and clinical experience, the authors suggest practical guidelines for screening and management of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A thorough medical history and preoperative evaluation are key to reducing venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> are present in a significant number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preoperative vigilance on the part of the plastic surgeon may help to identify patients with undiagnosed hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> and thereby decrease the incidence of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
