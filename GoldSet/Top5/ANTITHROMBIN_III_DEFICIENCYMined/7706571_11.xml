<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Septic and multiple trauma patients admitted to our Intensive Care Unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Levels of AT III below 70% were used as criteria to choose 36 patients, 20 of whom received treatment with AT III and 16 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: AT III concentrates were administered at an initial dose of 60 U/kg followed by 10 U/kg every six hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The administration of AT III neither contributes to alterations in haemostasis, nor the clinical evolution (evaluated according to Apache II score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the administration of AT III concentrates to critical patients with acquired low levels, but without manifest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, may not be justified; although further studies on a larger population are required to establish definite conclusions </plain></SENT>
