<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Under the age of 45 years, 129 patients with MI and 107 control subjects were included into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Traditional risk factors of CAD and protein C, S, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiencies</z:hpo>, factor V Leiden (FV Leiden), prothrombin G20210A and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutations were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in terms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, smoking, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, family history, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the patients and controls had protein C, protein S, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiencies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (7.8%) and 4 controls (3.7%) had heterozygote FV Leiden mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Homozygous prothrombine G20210A gene mutation was detected in one patient (1.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Homozygous MTHFR C677T mutation was observed in 7.8% (patients) and in 6.5% (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous MTHFR C677T mutation was detected 36.4% in patients and 31.7% in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference was not statistically significant in terms of carriage of thrombophilic mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that traditional risk factors increased the risk of CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin G20210A, FV Leiden and MTHFR C677T mutations, protein C, S and AT-III deficiencies did not increase the risk of CAD in our young population </plain></SENT>
