<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified two pedigrees of inherited type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> and two responsible mutations in each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A novel 21-22delAA appeared to have caused a frameshift with a premature termination at amino acid +63 in one patient and a large deletion including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven exons was identified by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some asymptomatic relatives of the second patient had the same mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present findings support the value of using more than one method of gene analysis and of studying the families of probands with inherited thrombotic disorders </plain></SENT>
