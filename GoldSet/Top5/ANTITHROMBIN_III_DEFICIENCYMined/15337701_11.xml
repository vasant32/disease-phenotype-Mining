<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II (HCII) is a hepatic serpin with significant antithrombin activity that has been implicated in coagulation, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and wound repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data obtained in mice lacking HCII suggest that this serpin might inhibit <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the arterial circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical relevance and molecular mechanisms associated with deficiency of HCII in humans are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the first family with homozygous HCII deficiency, identifying a Glu428Lys mutation affecting a conserved <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> at the hinge (P17) of the reactive loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No carrier reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, and only 1 homozygous HCII-deficient patient developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, but she also had a de novo Glu100Stop nonsense truncation in the antithrombin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the key structural role of the P17 <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in serpins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same mutation causes conformational instability and polymerization in 3 serpins: Drosophila necrotic, human alpha1-antitrypsin, and human HCII, which explains their plasma deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the family under study here, however, plasma HCII deficiency was not associated with a significant clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
