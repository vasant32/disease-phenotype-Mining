<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to find the relative prevalence of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of this work, hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in the absence of an acquired cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in addition to two of the following: 1) positive family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, 2) confirmed same deficiency in a closely related family member, 3) the deficient protein is constantly below 2 SD of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean on repeated testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ages were admitted to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Acquired systemic factors or local factors known to cause <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or affect the levels of proteins opposing <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were a total of 217 patients (102 males and 115 females) with confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 34 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 49 patients (26 males and 23 females) fulfilled the criteria of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 17 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> (PC), 15 protein S deficiency (PS), 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> (ATIII), 3 dyfibrinogenemia, 2 heparin cofactor II deficiency, and 2 plasminogen defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this group most of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was venous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A positive family history was obtained in 65.3% of patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven additional relatives with deficiency were identified upon family studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The calculated prevalence of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in Jordan is put at 1/25,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Screening for PC, PS, and ATIII is advocated in young patients who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo>, especially when there is a positive family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
