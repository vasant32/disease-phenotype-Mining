<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated healthy males between the ages of 42 and 77, asymptomatic patients with hereditary deficiencies of protein C or protein S, and persons receiving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results in specimens collected in an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> containing ACD, EDTA, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>, and 25 U/ml of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (a) were highly correlated with those collected in an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> containing a synthetic thrombin inhibitor, EDTA, and aprotinin (b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in asymptomatic patients with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, we found that the plasma levels of F1 + 2 in blood collected in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (a) were usually substantially higher than those collected in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined that this phenomenon was not attributable to the venipuncture procedure itself, but rather appears to be due to the action of low concentrations of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in the presence of reduced blood levels of antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data show that the previously documented elevations in plasma F1 + 2 levels in patients with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> appear to be caused by the above in vitro <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> effect, and that this population does not exhibit evidence of a prethrombotic state as defined by the F1 + 2 assay </plain></SENT>
