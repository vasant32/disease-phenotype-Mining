<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A cooperative, retrospective study was performed on data from 8 coagulation laboratories and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> units in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland to assess the risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with hereditary antithrombin III (AT-III), protein C (PC), and protein S (PS) deficiencies; to compare the clinical manifestations of these 3 deficiency states; and to estimate the risk for development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in high-risk situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hundred thirty patients from 71 families with a documented hereditary deficiency of a natural coagulation inhibitor were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient group comprised 69 patients from 25 families with AT-III deficiency, 86 patients from 27 families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e>, and 75 patients from 19 families with PS deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of the deficiency state was made at each participating center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were documented in a questionnaire that was completed during each patient's visit to the participating center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The questionnaires were sent to the coordinating center (Vienna) and analyzed centrally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probability of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was 80% to 90% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> deficiency states by 50 to 60 years of age, and this figure did not change considerably after data from the propositi were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AT-III-deficient females developed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> earlier in life compared with PC- and PS-deficient females due to a high thrombotic risk during pregnancy (40% in patients with AT-III deficiency) and oral contraceptive use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were similar in the three deficiency states except for a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> in patients with PC and PS deficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mesenteric vein thromboses occurred in 4% to 10% of patients and in 2 of 8 patients as a recurrent event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate was 63% (60% of recurrent events occurred spontaneously) and did not differ significantly among the three deficiency states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Before 14 years of age only 1 of 80 surgical procedures and 0 of 21 leg injuries were followed by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After 14 years of age <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> occurred after abdominal surgery or leg injury in one third of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Between 40% and 50% of symptomatic patients reported that they felt handicapped by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postthrombotic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that diagnosis of a coagulation inhibitor deficiency state should be made before 14 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>During childhood <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> prophylaxis cannot be regularly recommended but should be instituted after 13 years of age during/after abdominal surgery, including appendectomy, and after leg injury in AT-III-, PC-, and PS-deficient patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The high recurrence rate (60% spontaneous recurrence) and the relatively high frequency of mesenteric vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as a recurrent event favor introduction of long-term oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment after the first thrombotic event in patients with a documented hereditary deficiency of AT-III, PC, or PS </plain></SENT>
