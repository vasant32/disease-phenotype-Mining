<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A dramatic reduction of the level of AT III and of alpha 1 AT, two inhibitors of molecular weight close to that of albumin, was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The decreased level of AT III was counterbalanced by an increase in alpha 2 M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon accounts for the increased progressive antithrombin activity observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the affected children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the above compensatory mechanism explains the absence of thrombotic accidents in this series and that the benefit of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy is doubtful in these conditions </plain></SENT>
