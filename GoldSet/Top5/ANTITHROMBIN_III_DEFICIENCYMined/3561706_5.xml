<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> is a common complication in adult patients undergoing surgery, and after severe trauma, but not in otherwise healthy children less than 10 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it may also occur spontaneously without recognizable cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been known for a long time that some patients are particularly prone to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and in recent years great efforts have been made to identify the risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The attention of haematologists has been focused on the possibility that certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>abnormalities of coagulation</z:hpo> may be associated with a tendency to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, but only in a few instances a clear causal relationship has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One such example is a deficiency of antithrombine III, but such a deficiency has hitherto been recognized as a cause for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in children only in very particular circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We present two young children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of which one was purely ischemic and the other ischemic with secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both our patients showed an AT III deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient one also had a <z:mp ids='MP_0001575'>cyanotic</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> with right to left shunting which made <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> originating from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the iliac vein possible to occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We consider her hematocrit values too low to be a predisposing factor for this <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AT III deficiency may be caused by several different mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Either it exists as a congenital (hereditary) or as an acquired disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patient two the family history was positive for hereditary AT III deficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
