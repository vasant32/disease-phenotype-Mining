<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence of thrombophilic disorders in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032460" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PCO|PCOS1|PCO1|PCOS">polycystic ovarian syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e>) women with history of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was carried out in 184 women with history of RPL, of which 92 of them were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> and 92 patients were without known <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of thrombophilic disorders was compared between the two mentioned groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the findings, 70.7% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> women with history of RPL had thrombophilic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> group compared to the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> group (21.7% vs. 10.9%, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward higher prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> group compared to the control group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (23.9% vs. 13%, p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of other thrombophilic disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> elevation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> and Factor V Leiden was comparable between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of thrombophilic disorders was more common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> women than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> in women with history of RPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward higher prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> women, which needs further study </plain></SENT>
