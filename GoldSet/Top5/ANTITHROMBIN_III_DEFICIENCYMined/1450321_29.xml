<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective study on 680 consecutive patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> to determine the prevalence of hereditary deficiency of antithrombin III (AT III), protein C(PC) and protein S(PS) and to establish selection criteria for rational patient screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients at investigation was 44.3 +/- 15.4 years, while that at the first thrombotic event was 38.5 +/- 14.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total prevalence of inhibitor deficiency states was 48/680 (7.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>19/680 patients (2.8%) had AT III-deficiency, 17 (2.5%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC-deficiency</z:e>, nine (1.3%) PS-deficiency and three (0.4%) a combined deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 37/48 deficient patients family studies were performed and the hereditary nature was established in 19 cases (2.8% of total patient population, six with AT III-deficiency, eight with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC-deficiency</z:e>, four with PS-deficiency and one with a combined deficiency) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Family studies in these 19 patients revealed 46 additional individual patients with a hereditary deficiency state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive family history was found in 15/19 (79%) with a proven hereditary deficiency state, in 153/619 (25%) of non-deficient patients and in 11/29 (38%) of deficient patients without established hereditary nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the first thrombotic event was significantly lower in patients with a hereditary deficiency state (26.8 years) compared with the other two groups (39.0 and 39.7 years, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a hereditary deficiency the first thrombotic event occurred before the age of 45 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
