<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (APL) developed in a patient with congenital antithrombin III (AT-III) deficiency is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>), plasma AT-III activity was not decreased at the diagnosis of APL compared to the patient's baseline level (approximately 50% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was successfully treated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA) to achieve complete remission without the use of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although he developed <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> at the site of insertion of the intravenous catheter during remission-induction, no major thrombotic episode was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coagulation parameters including fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP-E), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), FDP-D dimer (D-D dimer), and plasmin-alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC) improved rapidly after initiation of ATRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case is a clear demonstration of the characteristics of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> developing in APL, i.e. no or minimal decrease in the level of AT-III activity and a predominant increase in the fibrinolytic system, rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
