<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In two patients, a clinical (contraceptive use) or genetic risk factor (factor V Leiden and C677T in the <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase gene [MTHFR]) was identified and corroborated the hypothesis that an interaction of factors accounted for the appearance of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no risk factor other than AT deficiency was identified in one patient with an important clinical and family history of spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three mutations were identified in these patients: a G--&gt;A transition in intron 5 at position +1 (5'--&gt;3'), three base insertions corresponding to arginine at position 5383 in exon 3A, and a G--&gt;A transition at 13328, corresponding to an Ala404Thr de novo mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The polymorphisms in the genes coding for coagulation factors XII and XIII and fibrinogen normally associated with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were not related to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first study in South America to assess the prevalence of AT deficiency and to report the molecular characterization of the mutations involved </plain></SENT>
