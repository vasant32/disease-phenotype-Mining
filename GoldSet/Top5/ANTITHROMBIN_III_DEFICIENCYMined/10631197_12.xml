<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of endogenous and exogenous risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in patients with upper limb <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT), and to evaluate the risk of clinically detectable pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, recurrent DVT, and postphlebitic symptoms in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A combined prospective and retrospective descriptive analysis of a cohort of patients with upper limb DVT compared with age- and sex-matched patients with lower limb DVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Internal medicine departments, and hematology and vascular surgery outpatient clinics at a tertiary-care university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with "spontaneous" upper limb DVT diagnosed between 1989 and 1997 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty age- and sex-matched patients with lower limb DVT admitted to the hospital via the emergency department served as control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients with upper limb DVT were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An endogenous risk factor (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>) was present in 11 of 18 patients vs 8 of 20 control patients (p = not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the upper limb group, nine patients had activated protein C resistance, four patients had anticardiolipin antibodies, and two patients had both forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 14 of the upper limb DVT patients were found to have an exogenous risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> compared with 7 of the patients with lower limb DVT (p = 0.01), and 66.6% of patients with upper limb DVT had both an exogenous and an endogenous risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> vs 15% of patients with lower limb DVT (p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No clinically detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> occurred among the upper limb DVT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients have minor postphlebitic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients experienced recurrent DVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the majority of patients with upper limb DVT that we studied in this relatively small study, exogenous (environmental) or endogenous risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, or a combination of both, were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in our patients, these thromboses had a low propensity to cause clinically significant pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and did not cause significant postphlebitic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Finally, we suggest that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy for these thromboses may be adequate and that thrombolytic agents and surgical intervention are not routinely indicated </plain></SENT>
