<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using the chromogenic substrate S-2222, we have optimized and automated an amidolytic assay for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The assay is based on the detection of anti-Xa activity generated by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The method is reproducible (intra- and interassay CVs of 2.4 and 3.3%, respectively) and reliable in antithrombin III-deficient plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results of this assay, obtained for plasma samples from patients and volunteers treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, correlate well (r = 0.899) with those of the test for activated partial thromboplastin time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon administration of a low-Mr heparinoid (Org 10172) and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> fragment ( Kabi 2165), however, the activated partial thromboplastin time failed to detect <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity, whereas the chromogenic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> assay revealed anti-Xa activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This automated amidolytic assay for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is therefore suitable not only for monitoring standard therapy with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> but also for measuring the activity of recently developed <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> fractions </plain></SENT>
