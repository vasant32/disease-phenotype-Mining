<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma AT activity and AT antigen level of the propositus and his kindred members were determined with chromogenic substrate method and immunoassay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the seven exons and intron-exon boundaries of antithrombin gene were analyzed by PCR and direct sequencing of amplified PCR products from the propositus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The propositus AT antigen level was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but his AT activity was only 65% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value suggesting that he had type II AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A heterozygous G13830A mutation in exon 6 resulting in Arg393His missense mutation in his AT <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> was identified in the propositus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same phenotype and gene mutation were found in other 3 kindred members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The type II AT deficiency found in this kindred is caused by heterozygous G13830A mutation in AT gene </plain></SENT>
