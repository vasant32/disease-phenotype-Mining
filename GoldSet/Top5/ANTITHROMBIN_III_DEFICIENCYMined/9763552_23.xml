<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The inherent variability of conformational diseases is demonstrated by two families with different mutations of the same conserved <z:chebi fb="94" ids="33709">aminoacid</z:chebi> in antithrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Threonine 85 underlies the opening of the main beta-sheet of the molecule and its replacement, by the polar lysine, in antithrombin Wobble, resulted in a plasma deficiency of antithrombin with an uncharacteristically severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at 10 years of age, whereas the replacement of the same residue by a nonpolar methionine, antithrombin Wibble, gave near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of plasma antithrombin and more typical adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isolated antithrombin Wibble had a decreased thermal stability (Tm 56.2, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 57.6 degreesC) but was fully stabilized by the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35369">pentasaccharide</z:chebi> (Tm 71.8, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 71.0 degreesC), indicating that the prime abnormality is a laxity in the transition of the main sheet of the molecule from the 5- to 6-stranded form, as was confirmed by the ready conversion of antithrombin Wibble to the 6-stranded latent form on incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>That this transition can occur in vivo was shown by the finding of nearly 10% of the proband's plasma antithrombin in the latent form and also, surprisingly, of small but definitive amounts of latent antithrombin in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latent transition will be predictably accelerated not only by gross mutations, as with antithrombin Wobble, to give severe episodic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, but also by milder mutations, as with antithrombin Wibble, to trigger <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the presence of other predisposing factors, including the conformational stress imposed by the raised body temperatures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fevers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both antithrombin variants had an exceptional (25-fold) increase in <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> affinity and this, together with an increased inhibitory activity against factor Xa, provides evidence of the direct linkage of A-sheet opening to the conformational basis of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding and activation </plain></SENT>
