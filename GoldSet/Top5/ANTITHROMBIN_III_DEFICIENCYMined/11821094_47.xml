<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary referral center in a teaching academic hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): One hundred forty-five patients with repeated pregnancy loss and 145 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): Prospective assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Prevalence of activated protein C (APC) resistance, protein C, protein S, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiencies</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, factor V Leiden, factor II G20210A, and MTHFR C677T mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): At least one thrombophilic defect was found in 66% of study group patients compared with 28% in control group patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined thrombophilic defects were documented in 21% of women with pregnancy loss compared with 5.5% of control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Late pregnancy</z:e> wastage occurred more frequently in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> compared with women without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (160/429 [37%] vs. 39/162 [24%], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>APC resistance was documented in 39% of women with pregnancy loss compared with 3% of the control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>APC resistance without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> was documented in 18% of women with pregnancy loss compared with none of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> was more common in women with pregnancy loss (25% vs. 7.6%), factor II G20210A and homozygosity for MTHFR C677T contributed to pregnancy loss only in the presence of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> was found in the majority (66%) of women with idiopathic pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>APC resistance with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> is the most common thrombophilic defect, and combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> is a frequent finding in women with pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> is associated with increased frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> wastage </plain></SENT>
