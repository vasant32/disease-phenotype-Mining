<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, linkage analysis between a common DNA polymorphism and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> trait showed that the defect lies at or close to the antithrombin III structural gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lod score for linkage within the larger Scottish kindred was 3.1 (theta = 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with previously published data suggesting that mutation of the antithrombin III structural gene is the cause of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> in some families </plain></SENT>
