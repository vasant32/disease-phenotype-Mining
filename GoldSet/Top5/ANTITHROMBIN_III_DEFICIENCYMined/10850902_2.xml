<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four human skin samples were prepared by Western blot analysis: 11 unburned and 22 burned control skin samples and 7 unburned and 14 burned skin samples from patients treated with AT(Human), or AT(H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intensity of hsp32 expression in burned AT(H)-treated skin (P &lt; .001) and in burned control skin (P &lt; .01) was significantly increased compared with unburned control skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intensity of expression of hsp70 was statistically significant in burned AT(H)-treated skin compared with unburned control skin (P &lt; .02), as was that of grp78 (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thermally injured skin with or without AT(H) treatment had an increased expression of hsp70, hsp32, and grp78 compared with unburned control skin </plain></SENT>
