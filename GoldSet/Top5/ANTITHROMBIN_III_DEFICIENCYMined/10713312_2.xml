<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> known to inhibit thrombin is not completely clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, their contribution may become relevant when antithrombin is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We elected to investigate adult patients with congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> to assess the concentration of other naturally occurring thrombin inhibitors such as alpha(2)-macroglobulin, alpha(1)-antitrypsin, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II, and C(1)-inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study included 59 patients with congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> with and without a previous history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, together with an equal number of control subjects matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant differences (patients vs. controls) were observed only for alpha(2)-macroglobulin (i.e., 120 vs. 102%, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of antithrombin-deficient carriers with and without a past history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> showed that alpha(2)-macroglobulin levels were higher than the 90th percentile of control distribution more often in asymptomatic than symptomatic men (odds ratio=0.04; confidence interval=0.003-0.60), but not in women (odds ratio=2.14; confidence interval=0.35-13.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, results from this cross sectional study showed that alpha(2)-macroglobulin levels were high in patients with congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the high levels were found more often in asymptomatic than symptomatic men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether this increase provides protection against <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> should be evaluated in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
