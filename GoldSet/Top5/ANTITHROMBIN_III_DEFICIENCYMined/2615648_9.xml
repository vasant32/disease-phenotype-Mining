<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify exons 2 and 6 of the human antithrombin III gene and direct sequencing to identify the base replacement in 12 genetic variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These occurred in individuals with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> due to functional abnormalities of circulating antithrombin: ten had decreased <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding and activation, two had decreased inhibitory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amino acid abnormality in ten out of 12 cases had arisen at a CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi>; this confirms the CpG sequence as a "hotspot" in the antithrombin gene and explains the observed frequency of occurrence of the same variant antithrombins in diverse populations </plain></SENT>
