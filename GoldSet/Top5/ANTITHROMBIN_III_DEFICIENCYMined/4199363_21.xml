<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A Dutch family (family A) with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin-III deficiency</z:hpo> and an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin-III levels were measured by means of a coagulation assay in plasma and by single radial immunodiffusion in plasma and serum.THREE GROUPS COULD BE DISTINGUISHED: group I comprised the relations-in-law of family A, group II the members of family A with a plasma antithrombin-III level higher than 90% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, when determined by the immunoassay, and group III the members of family A with an antithrombin-III level of less than 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To group III belonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight adults with an abnormal tendency to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and furthermore nine children, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> having a parent with abnormally low antithrombin-III levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean plasma and serum antithrombin-III levels were significantly decreased in group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the results of the coagulation assay showed some overlap between groups II and III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the immunoassay appeared to be much less laborious than the coagulation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the former assay is recommended in any search for similar families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of our family investigation confirm the findings of Egeberg (1965) that inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin-III deficiency</z:hpo>, giving rise to plasma levels between 50 and 60% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and that the pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
