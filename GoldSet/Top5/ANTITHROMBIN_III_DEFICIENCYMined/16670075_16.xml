<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 602 patients with previous VTE: the incidence of first recurrence in the absence of anticoagulation was retrospectively estimated in 64 patients with deficiency of antithrombin (AT, n=14), protein C (PC, n=28), or protein S (PS, n=22) and 538 with no known defect, who acted as the reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for sex, age, and circumstances of the first event, AT deficiency resulted an independent risk factor for recurrence (hazard ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.9); the carriers of PC or PS deficiency had a marginal increase in risk (hazard ratio 1.4, 95% CI 0.9-2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with AT deficiency are potential candidates for long-term oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
