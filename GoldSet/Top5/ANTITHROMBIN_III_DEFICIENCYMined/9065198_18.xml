<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of heterozygote and homozygote activated protein C resistance in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Activated protein C resistance and protein C and antithrombin III levels were determined in women (n = 50) with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> and in controls (50 women with a previous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutation of the factor V gene was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Activated protein C resistance was found in 22% of women with previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> compared with 10% among controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two women in the previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> group had a homozygote mutation of factor V; the others were heterozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the activated protein C ratio between women with previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> and the control group, 2.6 +/- 0.4 versus 3.1 +/- 0.5 (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the women had protein C or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results indicate that activated protein C resistance may be a contributory factor in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
