<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report three novel mutations accounting for cases of inherited type I antithrombin (AT) deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing of the coding sequences of the AT gene, we found one mutation in exon 4 and two in exon 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A deletion of 105 bp causing an in-frame deletion of 35 amino acids between Tyr 240 and Gly 276 was found in exon 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a second kindred, deletion of two <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenines</z:chebi> in codon 412-413 introduced a frameshift and a stop codon at position 431 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The last mutation was an insertion of ACCG in codon 387, generating a frameshift with a stop codon located at the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The finding of a sequence repeat of nine residues located at the 5' and 3' ends of the deleted fragment might explain the 105 bp deletion by slippage and mispairing at the replication fork during DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second mutation is the fourth described within a region of six amino acids (between Phe 408 and Arg 413), which seems to be a cluster of mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this case, the presence of a double repeat sequence--TTCCT and AACA--flanking this region could be particularly favorable for slipped mispairing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that human gene mutations are not random events but are strongly influenced by DNA flanking sequences </plain></SENT>
