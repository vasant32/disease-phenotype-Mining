<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether these complications are associated with an increased frequency of thrombophilic mutations is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 110 women who had one of the above-mentioned obstetrical complications and 110 women who had one or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The women were tested several days after delivery for the mutation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> at nucleotide 1691 [corrected] in the factor V gene (factor V Leiden), the mutation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi> at nucleotide 677 in the gene encoding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase, and the mutation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> at nucleotide 20210 in the prothrombin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two to three months after delivery the women were tested for deficiency of protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III and for the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mutation at nucleotide 1691 [corrected] in the factor V gene was detected in 22 of the women with obstetrical complications and in 7 of the women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancies (20 percent and 6 percent, respectively; P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four women with complications, as compared with nine women without complications, were homozygous for the C677T mutation in the gene encoding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (22 percent and 8 percent, respectively; P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene was found in 11 women with complications as compared with 3 women without complications (10 percent and 3 percent, respectively; P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 57 women with obstetrical complications had a thrombophilic mutation, as compared with 19 women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancies (52 percent and 17 percent, respectively; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Deficiency of protein S, protein C, or antithrombin III or anticardiolipin antibodies were detected in an additional 14 women with complications, as compared with 1 woman with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy (13 percent and 1 percent, respectively; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Women with serious obstetrical complications have an increased incidence of mutations predisposing them to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and other inherited and acquired forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
