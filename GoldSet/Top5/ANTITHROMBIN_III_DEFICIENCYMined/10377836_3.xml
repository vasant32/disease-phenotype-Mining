<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the studies reported so far, the different prevalence of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was found, greatly depending on criteria for selection of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>Arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> is most often the consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> but the prevalence of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> among young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and without recognized risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> is not known  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the frequency of hereditary deficiencies of antithrombin III (AT III), protein C (PC), protein S (PS), plasminogen (PLMG), factor XII (F XII) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011901'>dysfibrinogenaemia</z:hpo> was investigated over a 2-year period in 121 patients with venous or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> selected according to the recommendations of the British Committee for Standards in Haematology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included total a of 121 patients (58 males and 63 females) with documented venous or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Table 1 shows patient's characteristics regarding gender, age and clinical manifestation of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each patient fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: a) <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> prior to the age of 45; b) <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> prior to the age of 30, without risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>; c) <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo>; d) familial tendency to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; e) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of unusual localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A detailed history was taken from each patient on earlier personal or familial occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of this study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was characterized as congenital when the deficient protein was constantly below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value and when the same deficiency was confirmed in a close family member; acquired when the acquired disorder predisposing to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was present in absence of constant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein deficiency</z:e>; and idiopathic when the cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> tests were performed in plasma obtained after centrifugation of venous blood anticoagulated with 0.129 mol/1 sodium <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of fibrinogen, PT, PTT and F XII were measured by standard clotting methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At III, PC and plasminogen activity were determined by chromogenic methods using commercial reagents (Boehring, Marburg, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AT III, PC and total PS antigen were assayed by Laurell immunoelectrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was investigated by recommended tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 15 patients (12.4%) fulfilled criteria for hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Seven of them (5.8%) had AT III deficiency, five (4.1%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e>, two (1.6%) PS deficiency, and one patient had F XII deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was found in 21.5% of patients and the cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 66.1% of patients was not elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A high frequency of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> has been found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Among patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred at significantly younger age (29.9 vs. 42.2 and 40.9 yr.) compared to the patients with secondary and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> had also a higher occurrence of positive family history related to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (66.7% vs. 7.7% and 27.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The prevalence of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in nonselected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is relatively low, and for that reason the selection of patients, according recommended criteria, in whom the screening tests for congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> should be performed, is strongly suggested by many authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In our study we used the generally accepted recommendations for investigation of patients with venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The presence of congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was found in 15 (12.4%) of 121 studied patients, what is in accordance with results of other similarly designed studies </plain></SENT>
