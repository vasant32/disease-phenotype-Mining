<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Commercially available AT III concentrates showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel isoelectric focusing, however, they inhibited thrombin in the same manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At III concentrates were infused to 11 patients with congenital AT III deficiency (4 with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic parameters of infused AT III were calculated as follows; half time 61.1 +/- 23.0 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(58.4 +/- 22.6 hr. in the cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>), max increase rate 1.01 +/- 0.3%/U/kg and recovery rate 95.4 +/- 33.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simulation curves adjusted to the multiple administration were correlated well with the actually determined values in the patients and steady state concentration of AT III was achieved by the administration of this concentrate in 12 or 24 hour intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinically, substitution with AT III concentrate was proved to be effective for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> were treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (6,000 U/day) followed by AT III concentrate (1,500 U/day) administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms and laboratory findings were improved in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From these results substitution with AT III concentrate was suggested to be beneficial for the prevention or the treatment of thromboembolic disorders in the patients with AT III deficiency </plain></SENT>
