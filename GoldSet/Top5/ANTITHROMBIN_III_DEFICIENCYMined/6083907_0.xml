<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This seems to be of interest for the interpretation of laboratory data on AT III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, from these findings AT III replacement cannot be deduced and they cannot be used as a criterion to assess the prognostic value of AT III deficiency for the course of the underlying disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In acquired AT III defects the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is not necessarily decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After continuous infusion of doses below 500 USP in patients with DICFS and after administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> doses of 750 USP/h/70 kg in patients undergoing fibrinolytic therapy the AT III content rather increases continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After extremely high <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> doses during extracorporeal circulation in the heart-lung machine transitorily decreased AT III values return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In certain risk situations, however, such as after bolus injection of comparatively high <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> doses in patients with greatly reduced AT III values, a lowered <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> effect of high <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> doses must be expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these cases AT III replacement is indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, when enhanced <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resistance is suspected or diagnosed, treatment with AT III concentrates is justified only when the diagnosis is based on laboratory findings </plain></SENT>
