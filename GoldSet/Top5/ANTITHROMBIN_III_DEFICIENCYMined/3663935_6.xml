<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In one of these families <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> is caused by hemizygosity of the ATIII locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 15 kindreds, two copies of the ATIII gene are present and appear to be grossly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at the level of whole genome Southern blotting, suggesting that small deletions, insertions or limited nucleotide substitution(s) in the antithrombin III gene, or "trans-acting" defects at other loci involved in the processing, modification, and secretion of biologically active ATIII are responsible for the observed <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> disorders </plain></SENT>
