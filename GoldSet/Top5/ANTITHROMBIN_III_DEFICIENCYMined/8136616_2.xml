<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sole aim of the surgical procedure was prevention of recurrent embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the proximal extent of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> the source of embolization was identified as the iliac veins or inferior vena cava in 63% of the patients; 48% presented with a post-phlebitic vein and/or an older <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and 46% had already had recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unsuccessful aggressive procedures had been carried out previously in 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (PE) was 3% (one fatal case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The perioperative mortality was 6.8%, but only one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was related to the surgical treatment itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (8-140 months postoperatively, mean 55 +/- 34 months) late recurrent PE was confirmed in two patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, contralateral DVT) and was reported as the suspected cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a third (3.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Venous thrombectomy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> is a reliable and effective procedure for management of embolizing DVT and is indicated especially in young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rates of early- and late-recurrent PE are low, introduction of artificial material into the vein can be avoided, and long-term preservation of valve function is occasionally possible </plain></SENT>
