<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A possible role for fondaparinux as a bridging agent in the perioperative setting is explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Anticoagulation guidelines provide minimal direction on the perioperative use of fondaparinux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Published trials used fondaparinux <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> 2.5 mg daily for venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fondaparinux may have a role in bridge therapy for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The role of fondaparinux in perioperative bridge therapy has not been established, and there are some important limitations to its use as a routine bridging agent </plain></SENT>
