<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the molecular basis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of hereditary antithrombin (III) deficiency in nine Dutch families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and direct sequencing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> antithrombin gene exons and flanking intronic regions identified mutations in eight families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given the opportunity to correlate the molecular basis with survival, we addressed the relevance of molecular defects to mortality in inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The defects included single nucleotide deletions (7671 del G, 7768-69 del G) and insertions (5501 ins A, 2463 G--&gt;TC) that lead to frameshifts, a single base substitution [5381 C--&gt;T (129Arg--&gt;stop)] leading to a premature termination codon, and single base substitutions resulting in amino acid substitutions [2652 A--&gt;C (63Tyr--&gt;Ser), 13380 T--&gt;C (421Ile--&gt;Thr), and 13407 G--&gt;T (430Cys--&gt;Phe)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> affected individuals were heterozygous for the defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previously we found in Dutch families that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> did not lead to higher mortality compared with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In accordance with these findings, we observed no excess mortality in the nine families [Observed:Expected, 52:52.6; standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7-1.3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings confirmed a considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We therefore concluded that the lack of excess mortality in these families is not caused by a Dutch mild defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the longevity is not affected by molecular defects in the antithrombin gene and hypothesize that differences in mortality or natural history between families most likely result from other (genetic) risk factors </plain></SENT>
