<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of protein C, protein S and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiencies</z:hpo> and to screen for possible genetic deficiencies of these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study was undertaken in 20 consecutive children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265029" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">portal vein obstruction</z:e>, their parents and 20 matched healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265029" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">portal vein obstruction</z:e> displayed a reduction in protein C (p&lt;0.05), protein S (p&lt;0.0001), and antithrombin III (p&lt;0.001) activities as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein C and protein S activities were below 60% in nine and eleven of the children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265029" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">portal vein obstruction</z:e>, respectively, and antithrombin III activities were below or equal to 85% in ten of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repeated assay of protein C activity in seven children following a surgical portosystemic shunt showed a decrease as compared with preoperative values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protein C, protein S and antithrombin III were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parents, except two mothers in whom the levels of protein S activity and protein S antigen were found to be either below or at the lower limit of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that protein C, protein S and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiencies</z:hpo> are frequently found in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265029" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">portal vein obstruction</z:e> but are not likely to be of genetic origin in most cases </plain></SENT>
