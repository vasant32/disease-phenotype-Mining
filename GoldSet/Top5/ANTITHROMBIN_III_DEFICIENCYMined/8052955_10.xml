<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the incidence and disease profile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in Chinese patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 52 unselected Chinese patients with documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were studied for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Levels of antithrombin III (AT III), protein C (PC) and protein S (PS) as well as the presence of acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) and anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients were found to be abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These consisted of 5 AT III deficiencies, 9 PC deficiencies, 10 PS deficiencies, 1 combined PC &amp; PS deficiency (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the heterozygous range), and 5 patients with LA and/or ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the patients with LA and/or ACA are excluded, the incidence of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> is 25/47 i.e. 53.2% which is much higher than those reported in studies of Caucasian patients selected under strict criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Family studies performed in 16 cases of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> revealed involvement in 11 cases (68.7%); a total of 36 heterozygous family members were affected, most of which remain asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although 35 events predisposing to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (27 pregnancies, 1 oral contraceptive consumption and 7 surgical operations) were identified among these index patients, and the heterozygous family members, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was observed on only 6 occasions (17.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that pregnancy and surgery do not carry the same degree of thrombotic risk in Chinese as in the Caucasian population with heterozygous AT III, PC and PS deficiency </plain></SENT>
