<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used radioimmunoassays for the protein C activation <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e>) and the prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 to quantitate the extent of in vivo activation of protein C by thrombin-thrombomodulin and prothrombin by factor Xa, respectively, in the blood of individuals with this clinical disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 46 protein C deficient subjects from 18 kindreds were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 23 nonanticoagulated patients with an isolated deficiency of protein C, the mean level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> was substantially reduced while the mean concentration of F1 + 2 was significantly elevated as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (1.10 pmol/L v 1.78 pmol/L, P less than .0005 and 2.54 nmol/L v 1.51 nmol/L, P less than .0005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The metabolic behavior of 131I-F1 + 2 was found to be similar in protein C deficient patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, we were unable to establish a significant correlation between decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> levels and increased F1 + 2 measurements in these 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that heterozygous protein C deficient individuals with equivalent plasma levels of the zymogen may have markedly different biochemical profiles when assay techniques are used that quantitate the in vivo activity of the coagulation system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six individuals from three pedigrees were identified as having combined deficiencies of protein C and either antithrombin III or protein S; the genetic basis for the combined deficiency state was determined in two of the kindreds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally we observed that hemostatic system activity as measured by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> and F1 + 2 assays is markedly suppressed in protein C deficient patients who are chronically anticoagulated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> derivatives </plain></SENT>
