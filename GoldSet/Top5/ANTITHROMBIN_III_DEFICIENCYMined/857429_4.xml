<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> had a significantly lower AT III concentration, as determined by the immunological methods or biological method (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity), than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons without any history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A decreased level of AT III was found in 27 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these patients the immunoreactive antithrombin III was decreased to the same degree as biological activity (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity or anti-Xa activity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen out of these 27 patients belonged to 9 families and, hence, congenital AT III deficiency can be assumed in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aetiology was unknown in the other half </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with AT III deficiency are prone to spontaneous and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> and particularly, of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> is remarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In more than half of the patients the first thrombotic event occurred before the age of 35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treatment of choice in such patients is with oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
