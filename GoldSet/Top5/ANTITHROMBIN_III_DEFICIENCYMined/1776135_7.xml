<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A Japanese patient with congenital antithrombin III (AT-III) deficiency, named AT-III Kyoto, is associated with reduced levels (60% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) of AT-III antigen, progressive activity and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antithrombin III gene of this patient was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method followed by direct DNA sequencing analysis, which revealed a G to T transitional mutation resulting in the conversion of arginine-406 to methionine in exon 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arginine-406 is located at the 12th amino acid residue from the reactive site on the C-terminal side of AT-III in a core region of the molecule which has been highly conserved during evolution of serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> (serpin) family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that AT-III Kyoto is a newly described mutation which is similar to AT-III Utah and lends support to the idea that the conserved region near the reactive site is important in maintaining biological function of the AT-III molecule </plain></SENT>
