<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass requires systemic anticoagulation, defined by an activated clotting time (ACT) of 400-480 sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with altered <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> responsiveness require disproportionately higher doses of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> to achieve this target ACT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A common risk factor for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resistance is preoperative <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, therapy with low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) has become an acceptable substitute for prolonged <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current study examines the effect of preoperative LMWH therapy on subsequent <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> responsiveness during cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records of patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass over a period of four months were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified patients who, during the week preceding surgery, had received prolonged (&gt;24 hr) therapy with either sc LMWH (LMWH group) or continuous iv unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A Control group consisted of patients who received neither <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> nor LMWH preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> sensitivity index (calculated as the first change in ACT from baseline divided by the first intraoperative <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> dose, normalized to body weight), was compared among groups using ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-nine patients were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> sensitivity index was 33-45% higher in the Control group (1.6+/-0.7 sec.IU-1.kg-1; P&lt;0.0001) compared to the LMWH (1.2+/-0.4 sec.IU-1.kg-1) and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> (1.1+/-0.5 sec.IU-1.kg-1) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a multivariable model, the use of preoperative LMWH remained a significant predictor of reduced intraoperative <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> responsiveness (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prolonged preoperative LMWH therapy, similar to the known effect of prolonged unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion, reduces subsequent intraoperative response to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
