<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In congenital AT III deficiency, IEF and immunofixation revealed AT III as 8 bands which was indistinguishable from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control in terms of the number of bands and the isoelectric point (pI) of each band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the proband of the congenital AT III abnormality, however, IEF and immunofixation showed AT III as 8 bands which shifted slightly but definitely to the acidic side compared to those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This change in pI of the abnormal AT III was considered to reflect the amino acid replacement in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16541">polypeptide chain</z:chebi> of the abnormal AT III molecule </plain></SENT>
