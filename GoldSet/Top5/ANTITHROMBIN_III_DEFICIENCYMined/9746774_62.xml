<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, no direct comparison of the thrombotic risk associated with these genetic defects is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we wish to compare the lifetime probability of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the type of thrombotic symptoms, and the role of circumstantial triggering factors in 723 first- and second-degree relatives of 150 index patients with different thrombophilic defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found higher risks for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> for subjects with antithrombin (risk ratio 8.1, 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.4 to 19.6), protein C (7.3, 95% CI, 2.9 to 18.4) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> (8.5, 95% CI, 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5 to 20.8), and factor V Leiden (2.2, 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.7) than for individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> for subjects with factor V Leiden was lower than that for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other coagulation defects</z:e> (0.3, 95% CI, 0.1 to 1.6), even when arterial and superficial vein thromboses were excluded and the analysis was restricted to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (0.3, 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation defects</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent venous thrombotic manifestation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (90% in antithrombin, 88% in protein C, 100% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, and 57% in factor V Leiden), but a relatively mild manifestation such as superficial vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was common in factor V Leiden (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a predisposing factor at the time of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in approximately 50% of cases for each of the four defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, factor V Leiden is associated with a relatively small risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, lower than that for antithrombin, protein C, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, individuals with factor V Leiden develop less severe thrombotic manifestations, such as superficial vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
