<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of antithrombin III (AT) gene fragments specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction was utilized to identify the molecular basis of type 1 AT deficiency in two unrelated kindreds, both with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two novel point mutations were identified, deletion of a T from the second position of codon 81 in one propositus and insertion of a G in codon 424 in the second kindred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The AT 81(-T) frameshift mutation leads to a premature stop signal in codon 89, while the AT 424(+G) allele has a premature stop only one codon short of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter mutation changes the eight carboxy terminal residues of AT, including 429Cys, and increases the proportion of polar amino acids in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that altered folding of the mutant protein may explain the AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
