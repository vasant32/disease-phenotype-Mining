<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of modest endotoxemia on postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001396'>cholestasis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: It has not been determined whether endotoxin translocation in small amounts is a physiological phenomenon or whether it is a potential health hazard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood endotoxin, antithrombin III (ATIII), secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), which was selected as a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001396'>cholestasis</z:hpo>, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) concentrations were measured from the 20 patients undergoing curative gastrectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> preoperatively and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Portal and systemic blood samples were taken for the analysis of endotoxin and interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations during surgery in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although plasma endotoxin levels showed a significant increase during surgery, we did not find a correlation with ATIII, sIgA, CRP, and IL-6 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systemic blood endotoxin levels during surgery correlated with a postoperative rise of serum AAT levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma ATIII levels transiently decreased on the first and third postoperative day, and sIgA levels were shown to increase on the seventh postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a weak relationship between the extent of postoperative endotoxemia and a reduction in ATIII concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The influence of modest endotoxemia on postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001396'>cholestasis</z:hpo> was limited, and increased translocational endotoxemia during abdominal surgery may be a physiological phenomenon to trigger off an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase protein response </plain></SENT>
