<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the identification of a five nucleotide (CAGAA) deletion in exon 2 of the antithrombin gene that results in a shift in the frame of translation of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and introduces a premature STOP signal in codon 70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deleted <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> represent one repeat of a duplicated sequence within codons 36-39 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The deletion may have arisen by slippage and mispairing of the repeated sequences at the replication fork during DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
