<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 2-year prospective study was carried out in pediatric PVT patients (n = 14), their parents (n = 25), and an age-matched control group free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> (n = 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of PVT was assessed by means of Doppler ultrasound scan or angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the PVT patients presented biochemical or histologic signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency in PVT patients of protein C (PC), protein S (PS) and antithrombin (AT) deficiency was 42.9% (P &lt;.05 v controls), 21.4% (P &gt;.05) and 7.1% (P &gt;.05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the controls or parents of PVT patients presented hereditary PC, PS, or AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One PVT patient and one control (P =.999) presented prothrombin G20210A mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Homozygous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase C677T genotype was observed in 3 of 14 (21.4%) PVT patients and in 5 of 28 (17.9%; P =.356) controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of these patients presented factor V G1691A mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e> was frequent in pediatric PVT patients and does not seem to be an inherited condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The hereditary prothrombotic disorders do not seem to play a vital role in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in children and adolescents with PVT </plain></SENT>
