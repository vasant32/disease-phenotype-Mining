<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A Spanish family with a quantitative-qualitative antithrombin III (ATIII) deficiency and thrombotic tendency is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The qualitative defect was suggested by the crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in plasma of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the crossed immunoelectrofocusing (CIEF) showed the same ATIII pattern in controls and affected members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two populations of ATIII were detected by affinity chromatography on <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">sepharose</z:chebi> from affected members' plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ATIII unbound to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">sepharose</z:chebi> beads was devoid of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity and showed a lack of anodal migration in CIE in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ATIII eluted corresponded to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ATIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data supports the view that an abnormal ATIII molecule is present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected family members in the heterozygous state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first reported ATIII variant in which a molecular abnormality produces a lack of affinity for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> but no changes in its isoelectric point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This familial ATIII deficiency was named ATIII- Barcelona 2 </plain></SENT>
