<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter was responsible for a decreased synthesis of antithrombin III (AT III) resulting in low plasma activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was not successful and only fresh plasma led to recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activity of AT III, a progressive inhibitor of thrombin and cofactor of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, is always below 50% after L-asparaginase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, since the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is very low, interruption of treatment and fresh frozen plasma are needed only when additional risk factors are present </plain></SENT>
