<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have identified two novel minor deletions (case 1; -TA or -AT at nucleotide 9831-3 in exon 5 and case 2; -A at nucleotide 7640-1 in exon 4), one novel nonsense mutation (case 3; TAT to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> at nucleotide 7491 in exon 4), and one recurrent nonsense mutation (case 4; CGA to <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> at nucleotide 5381 in exon 3A) in Japanese kindreds with congenital type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The deletion detected in case 1 represented a symmetric element (CTCTGTCTC) and possessed a direct repeat (CTCTATGTCTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deletion in case 2 was recognized in a consensus sequence (TGAAT) and possessed a direct repeat (GATGAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nonsense mutation in case 3 formed a palindrome (CCGTTAACGG) and that in case 4 was caused by a CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that the mutations of congenital type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> are not random events but are influenced strongly by DNA sequences </plain></SENT>
