<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the molecular basis of type I AT deficiency in two women with recurrent VTE in the first trimester of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phenotype analysis showed both probands had almost 50% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two novel heterozygous AT mutations were identified: g.7920C&gt;T resulting in a Trp225Cys mutation in case 1 and g.13863C&gt;A causing an Ala404Asp mutation in case 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transient expression of either <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) or mutant AT expression vectors in HEK293T and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells showed impaired secretion of both AT mutant proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the staining of AT-Trp225Cys in both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus was similar to that of AT-WT, and the staining of AT-Ala404Asp was mainly present in ER but was weaker than that of AT-WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results revealed that the type I AT deficiency in two patients was caused by impaired secretion of the AT-Trp225Cys and AT-Ala404Asp mutant proteins, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two mutations are associated with a high risk of thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and women with these AT mutations are prone to VTE in early pregnancy </plain></SENT>
