<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The following case report describes a newborn patient with complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> whose pre-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> was aggressively managed prior to surgical correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 5-day-old, 2.5 kg child presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011611'>interrupted aortic arch</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001643'>patent ductus arteriosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On admission, he was in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005943'>respiratory arrest</z:hpo> suffering from profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the child was hypothermic (30.1 degrees C), septic (Streptococcus viridans), and coagulopathic (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was immediately intubated and initial coagulation assessment revealed the following: prothrombin time (PT) 48.9 s (international normalized ratio (INR) 15.7), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) &gt;106 s, platelet count 30,000 mm(3), fibrinogen 15 mg dL(-1) and antithrombin III (AT-III) 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before cardiac surgery could be performed, the patient's <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> was corrected with the administration of cryoprecipitate (15 ml), fresh frozen plasma (300 ml), and platelets (195 ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In spite of the large transfusion of fresh frozen plasma, the AT-III activity, measured as a percentage, remained depressed at 33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initial thromboelastographic (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="44926">TEG</z:chebi>) determination revealed an index of +2.02, and following 100 IU administration of an AT-III concentrate, declined to -2.32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sequential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44926">TEG</z:chebi> profiles were performed over several days, with the results used to guide both transfusion and medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defect</z:hpo> correction was subsequently performed with satisfactory initial results, but the patient developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> and expired on the 16th post-operative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present case describes techniques of coagulation management for a newborn with both a severe hemostatic defect and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
