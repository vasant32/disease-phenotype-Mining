<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: For two years blood tests were performed at &gt; 10 weeks after delivery on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HTN">hypertensive disorders</z:e> either before or during pregnancy, who had been consecutively admitted to our hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011419'>placental abruption</z:hpo>, intrauterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SAMPLE: A total of 62 women who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011419'>placental abruption</z:hpo> (n = 31), intrauterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (n = 18) and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>small for gestational age infant</z:hpo> (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Obstetric outpatient clinic in a university hospital (Free University Hospital, Amsterdam) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinaemia</z:e>, various <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> and anticardiolipins was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Abnormalities were found in 20 women in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011419'>placental abruption</z:hpo> group (20/31, 65%), in 10 women in the intrauterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> group (10/18, 56%) and in 11 women in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo> group (11/13, 85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight out of these 31 women had more than one abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the group of 62 women <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> was demonstrated in 26%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinaemia</z:e> in 24%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>Protein C deficiency</z:hpo> in 6%, anticardiolipin IgG in 11%, anticardiolipin IgM in 5%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> in 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three women were tested for activated protein C resistance (9% positive) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> (6% positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperhomocysteinaemia</z:e> was treated with a daily oral dose of 250 mg <z:chebi fb="5" ids="16709">pyridoxine</z:chebi> and 5 mg <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After six weeks of vitamin supplementation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were tested again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At that time a mean reduction of fasting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> value of 68% (95% CI 57-79) was found and of post-load value of 65% (95% CI 55-76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of our study, it can be concluded that women whose pregnancies are complicated by either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011419'>placental abruption</z:hpo>, intrauterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo>, even if there is no history of thrombo-embolic disorders or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> during pregnancy, should be advised to undergo an examination for metabolic and/or haemostatic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
