<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years, it has become evident that patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> may have more than one risk factor that may cause a state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to assess the prevalence of occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> using a novel method for the detection of spontaneous erythroid growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As controls, we studied <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors and four patients with liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and five patients with right-side <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, two conditions that in part mimic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> was determined by flow cytometric analysis of autonomous growth of erythroid precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were considered as having occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> if they had spontaneous erythroid cell growth in the absence of erythropoietin and with no features of overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cells from ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> demonstrated spontaneous erythroid cell growth; eight patients (32%) were found to have occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> and two patients had overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the controls had spontaneous erythroid growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the eight Budd-Chiari patients with occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, six had one or more additional recognized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (32%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, six patients (27%) had activated protein C resistance, five (23%) had anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies, five (23%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, and four patients (18%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients (14%) were homozygous to methyltetra hydrofolate reductase and ten (45.5%) were heterozygous </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, in 12 patients there were two or more combined risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using a flow cytometric analysis of autonomous growth of erythroid precursors we found a clear correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> and occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> </plain></SENT>
