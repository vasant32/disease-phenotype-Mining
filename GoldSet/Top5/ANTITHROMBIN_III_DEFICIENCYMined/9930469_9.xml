<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Medical therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> is limited, and surgical treatment has become more frequent recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have performed pulmonary thromboendarterectomy on 8 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patients were 6 men and 2 women aged 21 to 56 years (mean, 35 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, and 1 had congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preoperative condition was New York Heart Association functional class III in 5 and class IV in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hypoxemia, marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> (mean pulmonary artery pressure, 47+/-6.7 mm Hg), and low cardiac output were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median sternotomy, deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was induced using a cardiopulmonary bypass, and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy in the bilateral pulmonary arteries was performed under intermittent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-term respiratory management was needed postoperatively by 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 5 patients, no reperfusion injury was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The arterial blood oxygen concentration improved, and the mean pulmonary pressure decreased to 16+/-5.5 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cardiac output also increased, and New York Heart Association functional class improved to I in 4 and II in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy under deep hypothermic intermittent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> was effective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> for which medical treatment is of limited value </plain></SENT>
