<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The published data concerning changes of antithrombin III (ATIII) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> (NS) are contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While increased ATIII activity has been reported by some investigators, decreased concentration has been shown by others and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values by yet another group of authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined plasma and urine concentrations of ATIII in a group of 20 patients with NS using an immunologic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, plasma ATIII activity was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those obtained in a group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentration and activity of ATIII were both greatly reduced in the patients with NS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, substantial quantities of ATIII were recovered in the urine of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study, therefore, substantiates the low plasma concentrations of ATIII and its urinary losses in NS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, a parallel reduction in plasma ATIII activity is demonstrated providing functional evidence of acquired ATIII deficiency in this condition </plain></SENT>
