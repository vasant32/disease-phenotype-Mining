<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Circulating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> protein C (PC) and antithrombin III (AT) are markers of, and possibly involved in the pathogenesis of, significant organ dysfunction, in patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PSBC) or autologous bone marrow (BM) transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of the stem cell source, the use of hematopoietic growth factors (GFs), and the specific preparative regimen on the incidence of organ system dysfunction or on post-transplant levels of circulating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> has not been well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 205 patients in an attempt to correlate organ dysfunction and AT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiencies</z:e> with these transplant-specific factors (78 BMT with GM-CSF after transplant, 95 PBSCT without GM-CSF after transplant, and 32 PBSCT with GM-CSF after transplant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients transplanted with PBSC had a lower incidence of pulmonary dysfunction (20 vs 40%, P = 0.006) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> (4 vs 13%, P = 0.05) than patients receiving BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The use of GF after transplant did not influence the development of subsequent organ dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the stem cell source was again predictive of pulmonary dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, although patients transplanted with PBSC also had a lower incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e> (50 vs 81%, P &lt; 0.01) and AT deficiency (20 vs 54%, P &lt; 0.01) as compared with patients receiving BM, use of GM-CSF after transplant was a more significant risk factor for the development of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> deficiency (PBSC with GF vs PBSC without GF: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e> 50 vs 78%, P = 0.007; AT deficiency 20 vs 47%, P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis GM-CSF use was the only significant risk factor for development of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since the clinical significance of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> deficiency has been well shown, further studies examining these effects of hematopoietic GFs appear warranted </plain></SENT>
