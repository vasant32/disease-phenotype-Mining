<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased arterial shunting flow had caused <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> after incomplete repeated transarterial embolization procedures for dural AVFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple isolated sinus dural AVFs were located in the anterior superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and transverse sinus, which were completely embolized by direct packing of the isolated sinuses via the SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The development of dural AVF is complicated and associated with a number of factors, such as congenital abnormality, head trauma, craniotomy, radiation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001871'>hematological abnormality</z:hpo>, and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001871'>Hematological abnormality</z:hpo> is a risk factor of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present case, the multiple isolated sinus dural AVFs might have resulted from the aggravation of multiple dural AVFs and the coagulative tendency due to AT III deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Direct sinus packing should be considered if transvenous catheterization is difficult or fails </plain></SENT>
