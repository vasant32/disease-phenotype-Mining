<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reduced levels of coagulation clotting factors inhibitors (such as Antithrombin III) are known to be associated with increased thrombogenic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of Antithrombin III (AT III) deficiency as a risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients undergoing CVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study groups included patients with a reduced AT III activity (&lt; 70%, 20 consecutive patients) and with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT III values (&gt; 70%, 20 randomly selected patients), requiring a VC for chemotherapy and/or total parenteral nutrition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study protocol included evaluation of Hb, PLTs, PT (INR), aPTT, Fibrinogen and AT III at days 0, 1, 3 and 8 after CVC and upon VC removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peripheral and pullout phlebographies were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients on catheter withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A quantitative scale was developed to evaluate both VC and parietal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> degree in each catheter-containing venous segment (subclavian, innominate, superior vena cava); the sum of the mean values was defined as overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average VC dwelling time was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in Hb, PLTs, PT (INR), aPTT, Fibrinogen and in the remaining parameters of the study between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The group with AT III deficiency presented a higher degree of both parietal (p &lt; 0.05) and overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Data showed a higher severity of CVC-related <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with AT III deficiency than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the therapeutically-induced normalization of AT III levels can reduce the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> degree </plain></SENT>
