<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one individuals from 18 unrelated families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> have been identified as having a single point mutation within codon 384 (13268 GCA--&gt;<z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>) resulting in an alanine to serine substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six families (11 individuals) were identified by the screening of individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> or with a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo>, whilst the remaining 12 families (20 individuals) were identified by screening of asymptomatic blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four individuals had a history of venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic disease</z:e>, a further 2 gave a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> but the remaining 25 individuals were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Affected individuals demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immunological levels of antithrombin but a decrease in anti-IIa activity in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis was used to examine the possibility of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect to explain the high frequency of this non-CpG mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>29/31 individuals showed a single common "core" haplotype, the only variation existing in the number of copies of an (ATT)n repeat polymorphism--13, 14, 15 or 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that at most there are four independent origins for this mutation </plain></SENT>
