<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protein C levels were estimated in plasma both by chromogenic substrate assay and by immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protein S levels in plasma was determined by immunoassay using antisera to human protein S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III (AT-III) was assayed using monospecific rabbit antiserum to human AT-III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients were found to have hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> (11.52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Family studies revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive inheritance</z:hpo> in one patient and a dominant pattern in the remaining 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Protein S deficiency</z:e> was found in eight cases (6.1%), AT-III deficiency was established in five cases (3.8%) and a fibrinolytic defect in 33 cases (25.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of visceral and cerebral vessels and a positive family history were more frequently found among patients who had hereditary deficiency of one or the other antithrombotic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>Thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> of superficial veins was found to be very common in patients with protein C and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> and virtually absent in AT-III deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of protein C and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> in this ethnic group is attributed to the high frequency of consanguinity </plain></SENT>
