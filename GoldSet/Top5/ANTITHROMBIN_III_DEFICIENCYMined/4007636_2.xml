<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Significant increases of AT-III (p less than 0.025) measured as <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity were noted in 1 female and 1 male patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Failure to augment levels in the other male patient may have been due to poor absorption of the drug following small bowel resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267406" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mesenteric infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Side effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> deficiency necessitated dosage reduction in the female patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 2 males experienced no adverse side effects except for prolongation of the prothrombin time in 1 who was receiving oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> causes a significant increase in some individuals with familial AT-III deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are necessary to determine whether this form of therapy may prove to be a suitable alternative to long-term anticoagulation and to assess the long-term clinical benefits in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
