<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is possible that such a procedure could reduce the biological activity of the proteins and induce changes in structure and aggregation state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have therefore made in vitro and pharmacokinetic studies of heat treated antithrombin III (AT III) concentrate using both radiolabelled and non-labelled preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purification, heat treatment and the radiolabelling procedures did not induce any changes in the AT III molecules with exception of a decrease in <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> affinity in about 10% of the molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The in vivo studies using 125I AT III showed that the fractional catabolic rate was increased and the half-life was shortened by about 20-25% compared to our previous studies on non-heat treated AT III concentrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our present findings indicating a mean half-life of 3.0 days are quite comparable to studies by others on non-heat treated AT III, however </plain></SENT>
