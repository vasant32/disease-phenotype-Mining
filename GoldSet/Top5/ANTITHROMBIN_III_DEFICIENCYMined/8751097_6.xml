<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study, concentrations of these factors were measured to determine the prevalence of deficiencies of these proteins in ocular vascular occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 167 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arterial (28%) or venous occlusion (55%) or ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> (17%) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean values obtained for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (protein C, 102 +/- 25%; protein S, 109 +/- 22%; antithrombin III, 23.6 +/- 3.1 IU/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III was pathologically reduced in one patient with branch venous occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proteins C and S were severely altered in two patients with central venous occlusion, in one individual with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo>, and in one patient with branch <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subnormal values were found in 21 patients for antithrombin III (16.1-19.9 IU/ml), in 7 patients for protein C (55-65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of these five patients with pathologic findings showed severe vascular manifestations in the form of current <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> and multiple <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their age was 30 and 53 years, respectively, and differed considerably from the mean age of the entire group (65 +/- 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that these proteins were important factors for the development of ocular vascular occlusive diseases in single patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the prevalence is low, measurement of these parameters in young patients may be useful in preventing other vascular complications </plain></SENT>
