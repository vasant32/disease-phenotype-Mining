<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Plasma Antithrombin III (At III), a natural inhibitor of coagulation, was determined using a single radial immunodiffusion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 116 diabetics, plasma At III levels were significantly decreased (26.6 +/- 0.4 mg/100 ml) compared with those in 64 controls (31.0 +/- 0.3 mg/100 ml, P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An elevation of plasma fibrinogen degradation products in 42 per cent of our patients, and a positive linear relationship between platelet counts and At III levels ( r = 0.29, P less than 0.01), provided additional evidence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disseminated intravascular clotting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> complications were more frequent in patient with low plasma At III levels (50.6 per cent of cases) than in those exhibiting At III concentrations within a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range: 32.4 per cent of cases (X2 = 6.09, P less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that the low levels of At III encountered in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> result from excessive consumption, and that the deficiency may be responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and/or aggravation of intravascular clotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At III deficiency may therefore contribute to vascular degenerative complications, particularly those leading to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
