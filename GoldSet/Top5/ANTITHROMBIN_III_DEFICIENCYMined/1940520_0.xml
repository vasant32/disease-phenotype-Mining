<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had been complicated by the right atrial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> due to type I familial antithrombin III (ATIII) deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary embolectomy and caval interruption was performed 20 days after the initial attack and followed by anti-coagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thrombi</z:e> weighed 50 gm were removed mainly from the left pulmonary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The right atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> which had got smaller by the preoperative fibrinolytic therapy could not be found with right atriotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Respiratory function at rest and slightly elevated pulmonary arterial pressure was normalized post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the PTE in this patient was considered to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> by the histological findings of the fibrin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> removed, tapering of pulmonary arteries in PAG and obstructive intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the small vessels in the lungs suggests the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> nature of the PTE (post-thrombotic obstruction of pulmonary arteries) caused by the hyper-coagulable state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with familial ATIII deficiency, 50% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ATIII activity can be expected because they are heterozygotes, so the cardio-pulmonary bypass should be run with special caution to the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Caval vein interruption and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy are recommended for prophylaxis of recurrent PTE </plain></SENT>
