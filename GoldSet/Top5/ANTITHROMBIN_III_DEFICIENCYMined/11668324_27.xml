<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Mesenteric <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (MVT) and its clinical spectrum have become better defined following improvements in diagnostic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Historically, MVT has been described as a morbid clinical entity, but this may not necessarily be true </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Often, an underlying disease process that predisposes a patient to MVT can be found and potentially treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the diagnostics and management of MVT and to review long-term results of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Thirty-one patients in whom MVT was diagnosed between 1985 and 1999 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survivors were contacted for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 15 men and 16 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ages ranged from 22 to 80 years (mean, 49.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo>, 10 had a history of previous abdominal surgery, 6 had a prior thrombotic episode, and 4 had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MVT presented as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (84%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (42%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) was considered diagnostic in 18 (90%) of 20 patients who underwent the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CT diagnosed MVT in 15 (100%) of 15 patients presenting with vague <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrated MVT in only five (55.5%) of nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven of 31 patients died within 30 days (&lt; 30-day mortality rate, 23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (72%) were initially treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were not heparinized: four of them died, and two were later given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">warfarin sodium</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">Coumadin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Of the 31 patients, only one received lytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Three patients became symptom free without anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (32%) underwent bowel resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Overall, 19 (79%) of 24 survivors were treated with long-term <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up was obtained in 24 patients (mean, 57.7 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one (88%) of 24 survived in follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of MVT should be suspected when <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011458'>abdominal symptoms</z:hpo> develop in patients with prior thrombotic episodes or a documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>CT scanning appears to be the primary diagnostic test of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>If diagnosed and treated early, MVT is not likely to progress to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gangrenous</z:e> bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Recent mortality rates for MVT are lower than previously published, perhaps because of earlier diagnosis and aggressive treatment or possibly because we now readily diagnose a more benign form of the disease, which is due to widespread use of CT scanning </plain></SENT>
