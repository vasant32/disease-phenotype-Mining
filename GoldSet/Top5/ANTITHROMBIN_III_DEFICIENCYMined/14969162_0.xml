<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the prothrombotic risk factors in 124 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) as compared with control subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0810319" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other gastrointestinal disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were hospitalized from 1991 to 2000 in the Department of Internal Medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelets level was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) in UC patients as compared with control group, and aPTT was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) prolonged respectively in UC patients as compared with control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the prospective pilot study we observed the decrease of plasma antithrombin level and/or decrease of protein S in approximately 22% of UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasma protein C activity was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> UC patients, whereas the mean level of protein S was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.02) in UC patients as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus our data indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> are potential risk factors of thromboembolic complications in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were above upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values in 38% and 18% UC patients respectively, but mean values of both parameters were not significantly different between UC and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> changes are not independent risk factor of vascular complication in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In UC patients smokers were observed 4 times less than no-smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, positive correlation between smoking and rise of hematocrit (F = 4.48; p &lt; 0.05) in UC suggests that smoking may be a risk factor of vascular complications in the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were found in 1.6% of UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> was accompanied approximately 6% of UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of prothrombotic risk factors and associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart diseases</z:e> may have prognostic value in the management of UC </plain></SENT>
