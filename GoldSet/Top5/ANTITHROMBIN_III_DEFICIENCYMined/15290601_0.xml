<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: CT pulmonary angiography is now often the first-line investigation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When these studies are performed after hours in teaching hospitals, they are often initially interpreted by trainees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is of great significance whether the interpretations of trainees and certified radiologists with regard to the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> on CT pulmonary angiograms correspond, because of the morbidity and mortality of both the condition and its treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive CT pulmonary angiograms (CTPAs) of hospitalized patients were viewed at lung and soft tissue windows both on a workstation and on hard copies, at the observers' discretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each CTPA was divided into 28 arterial zones based on pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> (including the subsegmental arteries), giving a total of 700 arterial zones, and analyzed retrospectively and independently by two cross-sectional imaging specialists and four residents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each arterial segment was rated with regard to pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> as either high, intermediate, or low probability or not visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The kappa (Kappa) test, which tests for interobserver agreement, was used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the time of the scan <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were hospitalized for underlying conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 25 patients studied, 9 were referred from the ICU, 7 experienced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, 5 were post-partum women, 2 had had a recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1 patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, and 1 had a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> was 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the main pulmonary arteries interobserver agreement was good (Kappa=0.61) and for the segmental pulmonary arteries it was fair (Kappa=0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the subsegmental arteries interobserver agreement was poor (Kappa=0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The zones where interobserver agreement was greatest (Kappa&gt;0.4) were the left main, left lower lobe, and the right main pulmonary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement was poorest (Kappa&lt;0.05) in the left interlobar, left lower lobe lateral basal segment, right lower lobe superior segment, and left lower lobe superior segment branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>None of the patients expired due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most life-threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> requiring urgent treatment are the more central emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that trainees and certified radiologists can make similar conclusions regarding these central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> in hospitalized patients and that preliminary interpretations by trainees should not therefore adversely affect patient care </plain></SENT>
