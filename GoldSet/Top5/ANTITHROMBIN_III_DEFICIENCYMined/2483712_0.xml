<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In about 50% of the cases of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> a congenital deficiency of an inhibitor of coagulation or an insufficient fibrinolytic mechanism can be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> a connection with <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperactive</z:mp> platelets or with a diminished availability of tissue plasminogen activator can be found in about 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in these cases the defect which provokes <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is mostly acquired and is connected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and/or with atherosclerotic alterations of the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A study on patients with thromboembolic tendency and detectable risk factors was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 470 patients could be observed for 2 years under an adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of thromboembolic episodes 2 years prior to prophylaxis and 2 years under prophylaxis was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In venous cases <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> could be controlled almost completely by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23403">coumarins</z:chebi> when the underlying cause was a deficient plasmatic inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with diminished fibrinolysis there was only a partial effect of oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A better result could be obtained when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15447">pentosan</z:chebi> polysulfate was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> the results of prophylaxis were less convincing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in patients with an increased platelet function was only moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> hat to be discontinued in about 20% of the patients because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017187" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal problems</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15447">Pentosan</z:chebi> polysulfate in patients with a diminished fibrinolytic capacity had a fairly good effect and resulted in a 60% reduction of thromboembolic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is shown that an exact diagnosis of the underlying deficiency which is likely to cause <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> can also improve the efficacy and the specificity of prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
