<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we describe a case of a novel splice-site mutation in the SERPINC1 gene in a Korean patient with inherited AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 35-year-old woman who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> and was without a recent history of any precipitating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The obtaining of her family history revealed that her mother had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> and her two sisters both had an episode of DVT during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing of SERPINC1 revealed the novel variant IVS1-2A&gt;T (c.42-2A&gt;T), a substitution in intron 1, in the proband and her daughter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutation IVS1-2A&gt;T eliminates the acceptor splice-site of intron 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present case is the first novel splice-site mutation of SERPINC1 in a Korean family with inherited AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
