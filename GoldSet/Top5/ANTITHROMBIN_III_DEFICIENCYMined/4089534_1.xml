<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Plasma antithrombin (AT) measured as <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity decreased 0.16 +/- 0.13 U/ml (mean +/- SD) in 198 patients who received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion during 1 wk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The decrease was weakly, but significantly correlated to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> dose (r = 0.15, p = 0.02) and to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plasma concentration (r = 0.12, p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with subnormal AT at start of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment, AT decreased less and tended to normalize at the end of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion, suggesting increased synthetic rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decrease in AT was apparently unrelated to the extension or the fate of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, and also unrelated to other patient and disease characteristics apart from a significantly higher decrease in diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5 out of 9 patients with AT values below 0.60 U/ml had serious disease, and 1 died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (PE) shortly after cessation of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (AT 0.22 U/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the main decrease in AT occurs during the initial 3 d of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If AT stays above 0.70 U/ml after 3 d of treatment, further AT monitoring is hardly indicated </plain></SENT>
