<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the changes of haemostatic molecular markers after antithrombin III (AT III) administration in a 22-year-old woman with congenital AT III deficiency in the third trimester of pregnancy who did not have <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various markers including fibrinopeptide A (FPA), thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 (F1 + 2), plasmin-alpha 2antiplasmin, D-dimer, beta-thromboglobulin, and platelet factor 4 were measured before and just after 3,000 U of AT III concentrate, which was given three times per week from the 34 week of pregnancy until delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Just after AT III administration, F1 + 2 and FPA levels decreased on most occasions, while TAT sometimes increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma FPA levels were markedly decreased on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 8 occasions when the plasma FPA levels was above 2.0 ng/ml before AT III administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma FPA levels were always greater than or equal to 6.4 ng/ml before AT III administration on the 4 occasions when TAT increased to above 115% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changes of plasma F1 + 2 levels were significantly correlated with the AT III level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that prophylactic AT III administration in the third trimester immediately inactivates intravascular thrombin to form TAT and reduce the plasma FPA level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the transient TAT elevation following AT III administration may not only be due to extraction of thrombin from the fibrin clots of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> but also to intravascular thrombin which is not attached to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FPA is the best molecular marker for thrombin <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> and it should be monitored in AT III-deficient pregnant women in the third trimester </plain></SENT>
