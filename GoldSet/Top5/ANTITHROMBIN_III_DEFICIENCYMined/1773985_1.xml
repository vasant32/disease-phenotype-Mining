<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rates of improvement of various markers after AT III administration (frequency of improvement/frequency of administration) were as follows: fibrinopeptide A (FPA) 82%, D-dimer 70%, fibrinopeptide B beta 15-42 73%, beta-thromboglobulin 60%, and platelet factor 4 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between the plasma AT III activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plasma FPA values, but FPA values of over 3.9 ng/ml showed a significant negative correlation with AT III activity: AT III activity (%) = -6.59 x FPA (ng/ml) + 125, r = -0.851, p less than 0.02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore recommend continuous monitoring of the plasma FPA level and administration of AT III concentrate when the FPA level is elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the regression line shown above, plasma AT III activity should be raised to 100% to keep the FPA level below 6.0 ng/ml with 95% confidence limit </plain></SENT>
