<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients had acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> and objectively diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A decreased 125I-antithrombin III plasma disappearance halflife and an increased fractional catabolic rate was found in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transcapillary flux ratio was elevated in the patient with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A follow-up study of the first patient during a period when no signs of an ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> were present and no medication was taken showed completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tracer data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data are consistent with both gastrointestinal loss and intravascular consumption of antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> could not be explained by other causes such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo>, or obvious <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reduced antithrombin III plasma levels were considered to have contributed to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in both patients </plain></SENT>
