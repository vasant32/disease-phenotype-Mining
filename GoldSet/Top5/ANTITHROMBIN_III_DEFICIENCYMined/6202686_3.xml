<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of activated human Factor X by human plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> was investigated in both purified and plasma systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the former, antithrombin III, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, and alpha 2-macroglobulin, at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma concentrations, markedly inhibited activated Factor X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant inhibition by alpha 2-antiplasmin, however, was only achieved when present at 40 times its plasma concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative rates of inhibition of activated Factor X coagulant activity in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human plasma, antithrombin III-deficient plasma, and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor-deficient plasma were 1.0, 0.63, and 0.75, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From these relative rates of inhibition and their measured concentrations in the 3 plasmas, it was calculated that antithrombin III, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, and alpha 2-macroglobulin contribute 53, 35, and 12%, respectively, to the inhibition of activated Factor X in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using 125I-labeled activated Factor X and a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi> disc gel electrophoresis and immunoadsorption, it was then demonstrated that antithrombin III accounted for 45-55%, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, 35-40%, and alpha 2-macroglobulin, 10-15% of the inhibition of the labeled protease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The values obtained with the deficient plasmas are consistent with the distribution of activated Factor X-inhibitor complexes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data show by two independent techniques, one measuring coagulant activity and the other 125I-labeled activated Factor X-inhibitor complexes, that both antithrombin III and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor are the major inhibitors of activated Factor X in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human plasma </plain></SENT>
