<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report 22 novel antithrombin gene (SERPINC1) mutations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> in 17 French and five German families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> present at the heterozygous state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine missense mutations accounted for type I deficiency, defined by equally low antithrombin activity and antigen level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of them (7/9) affected highly conserved serpin residues and were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> occurring at a young age (before age 32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One splice site, one nonsense mutation, three small deletions and one insertion were also identified as a cause for type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven other missense mutations were identified in type II or unclassified AT deficiency; g.5270C&gt;T (p.T147I, T115I) and g.5281A&gt;T (p.I151F, I119F) change residues in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding region, g.13267C&gt;G (p.P439A, P407A) and g.13271T&gt;C (p.F440S, F408S) affect amino acids in the pleiotropic region, g.2372G&gt;A (p.G25D, G-8D) changes a signal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> amino acid, g.2456G&gt;C (p.C53S, C21S) affects one of the three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonds of the protein, and g.7585A&gt;T (p.M347K, M315K) changes a nonconserved residue on strand 2C </plain></SENT>
