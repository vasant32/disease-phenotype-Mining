<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have identified an inherited qualitative deficiency of antithrombin III (AT III) in a family with apparently no increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma antithrombin and anti-Xa activities were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but the interaction with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> and low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was uniformly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An immunoblotting technique performed in plasma showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> complex formation with thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> affinity chromatography and crossed immunoelectrophoresis, the variant could be separated: at least two fractions of low affinity AT III were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A minor one had no antiprotease activity; the other one was further purified to homogeneity and found to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> specific activity in absence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and a 50% decreased activity in presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose to call this new variant AT III Clichy </plain></SENT>
