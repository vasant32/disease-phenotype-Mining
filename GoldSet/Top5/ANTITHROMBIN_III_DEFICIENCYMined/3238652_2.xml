<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three patients with familial antithrombin III (ATIII) deficiency, who also have histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, were treated with oxymetholone in combination with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis was observed in one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of inferior vena cava during the oxymetholone and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No further thromboembolic episodes occurred in these patients after initiation of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> with or without oxymetholone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of plasma ATIII, alpha 1-antitrypsin, plasminogen and Cl-inactivator were significantly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after the introduction of oxymetholone therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that oxymetholone augments <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and fibinolytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence we consider that oxymetholone in combination with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> may be possible thrombolytic therapy in patients with familial ATIII deficiency </plain></SENT>
