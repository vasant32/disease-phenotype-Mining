<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The utility of laboratory investigation of relatives of individuals with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the risk of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) among the carriers, we investigated a family cohort of 1,720 relatives of probands with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> who were evaluated because of VTE (n=1,088), premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (n=113), obstetric complication (n=257), or universal screening before pregnancy or hormonal contraception or therapy (n=262); 968 relatives were carriers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) occurred in 44 carriers and 10 non-carriers during 37,688 and 29,548 observation-years from birth, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk of DVT among the carriers compared with non-carriers was estimated as a hazard ratio (HR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If the proband had VTE and factor V Leiden (FVL) and/or prothrombin (PT)20210A, the HR for DVT was 2.77 (95%CI 1.21-4.82) in the carriers overall, and 5.54 (95%CI 3.20-187.00) in those homozygous or double heterozygous for FVL and PT20210A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the proband had VTE and a deficiency of antithrombin (AT), protein C or S, the HR for DVT was 5.14 (95%CI 0.88-10.03) in the carriers overall, and 12.86 (95%CI 2.46-59.90) in those with AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No increase in risk was found among the carriers who were relatives of the probands who were evaluated for reasons other than VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, familial investigation for inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> seems justified for probands with previous VTE, but appears of doubtful utility for the relatives of probands without VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This should be taken with caution regarding families with deficiency of natural <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, given the low number of cases analysed </plain></SENT>
