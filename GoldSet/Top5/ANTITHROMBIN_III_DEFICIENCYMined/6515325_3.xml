<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of qualitative disorder is suspected when a discrepancy is found between immunological and functional levels of AT-III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> has been hypothesized in both quantitative and qualitative deficiency of AT-III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A technique based on crossed immunoelectrofocusing (CIEF) was applied to investigate molecular variants of AT-III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3 families with low functional and immunological levels of AT-III and 1 family with only a low functional AT-III level were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An abnormal AT-III pattern was found with CIEF in the family with suspected qualitative disorder and in 1 of the families with quantitative disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 2 abnormal patterns were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus the use of CIEF AT-III patterns could help to define congenital AT-III deficiencies and could serve as a basis for classification of different forms of AT-III deficiency </plain></SENT>
