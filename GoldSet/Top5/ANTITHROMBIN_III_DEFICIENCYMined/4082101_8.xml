<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both anti-activated factor X (anti Xa) and antithrombin activity were decreased, in the absence and in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, while protein concentration was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in an immunological assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The abnormal AT III copurified with functional AT III using insolubilized <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> affinity chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">Polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a TSK column suggest that AT III Charleville forms unstable complexes with thrombin from which a modified protein is rapidly released </plain></SENT>
