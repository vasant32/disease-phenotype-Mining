<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the control of thrombin in the microvasculature at the endothelial cell surface is crucial to prevent atherothrombosis, the role of antithrombin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is widely considered that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> is unlikely to contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, but no convincing epidemiological study has been performed because of the low frequency of this deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we evaluated the role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) of a relatively common mutation affecting antithrombin gene (A384S: Antithrombin Cambridge II) that has functional features that may impair the right control of thrombogenic events caused by injury to the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this deficiency, which is not detected using common methods to diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e>, also increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We included 1,224 patients with MI (691 consecutive patients and 533 survivors of a premature event), and 1,649 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutation was identified in 0.3% of controls, but 0.8% of MI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for sex and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, the antithrombin Cambridge II significantly increased 5.66-fold the risk of MI (95% CI: 1.53-20.88; p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, young patients had the highest risk of MI associated with the mutation (OR: 9.98; 95%CI: 1.60-62.24; p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first epidemiological study that supports a role for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that deficiency of antithrombin may be an independent risk factor for MI that has been underestimated, but larger studies are needed to confirm the relevance of inhibitors of thrombin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
