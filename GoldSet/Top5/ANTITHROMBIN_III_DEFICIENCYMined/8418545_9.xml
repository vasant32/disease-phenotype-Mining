<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe 10 young adults with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> due to deficiencies in these factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty patients younger than 45 years were hospitalized because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> diagnosed through computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was performed in 54 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hematologic and coagulation profiles, autoantibody screen, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> serology, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> were analyzed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the total cases, Holter monitoring was performed in 13 patients, echocardiography in 20, and cerebrospinal fluid studies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cysticercosis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The quantitative analysis of protein C, protein S (by Laurell rocket immunoelectrophoresis), and antithrombin III (by radial immunodiffusion) was performed on admission and 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and in relatives of six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 10 cases (17%) the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was attributed to deficiency of coagulation inhibitors: three men had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, two women had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, and five had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> (three men and two women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> involved the carotid territory in these 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None had previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight patients showed a complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An acquired disorder was presumed in one protein S-deficient and in two antithrombin III-deficient patients; the remainder were considered heterozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cerebral vasculature may be primarily involved in the deficiency of these natural <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Young adults seem to be the most often affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A knowledge of these new clotting defects will enable the clinician to improve the prevention and treatment of this devastating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
