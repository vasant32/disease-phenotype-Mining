<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five consecutive and unrelated patients with otherwise unexplained venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both antigen and activity of inhibitors were determined using commercial kits (Stago), activated PC sensitivity ratio (APC SR) by Coatest (Chromogenix), and factor V mutation by polymerase chain reaction with sequence specific primer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 85 patients, 41 were male, 44 female, and mean age 49.4 years (17-82 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None had factor V mutation, or APC SR of less than 2; 50 (58.8%) showed a deficiency of inhibitor proteins; 34 (68.0%) were hereditary, 16 (32.0%) non-hereditary; 3 had an AT III deficiency, 16 a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e>, 28 a PS deficiency, and 3 a combined deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five were non-deficient without a known cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average age at the first thrombotic episode was 48.5 years (13-81 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> occurred spontaneously in 39 (78.0%) of 50 deficient patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a relatively higher prevalence of AT III, PC and PS deficiency (59%), but no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>, was found in venous thrombophilic Chinese patients in Taiwan compared to that in western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Screening for inhibitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein deficiency</z:e> in Chinese thrombophilic patients is highly recommended </plain></SENT>
