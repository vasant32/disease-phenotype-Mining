<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-four children presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) and 18 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015503" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor VII deficiency</z:e> +/- <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> +/- <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were free of hemostasis anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 5 children, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> was necrotic on admission, whereas in 9 additional patients skin <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> occurred subsequently (5 patients with and 4 without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 18 children (26%) who died, 16 were in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors II and V, fibrinogen and platelet counts were lower in children who died and were correlated with the prognostic score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> group, however, factor VII + X level was not correlated with the prognostic score and was equally low in fatal and non-fatal cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III level was markedly decreased in patients who subsequently developed <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that factor VII level decreases early in the course of SIP and that consumption of physiologic coagulation inhibitors probably plays a central part in the development of necrotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
