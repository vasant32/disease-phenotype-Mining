<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective was to retrospectively study the largest series of patients that has received antithrombin III for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 48 patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (median age, 39 years; range, 1-69 years); 38 of the 48 received a nonradiation-based conditioning regimen and 21 of 48 received a transplant from an unrelated donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment was primarily directed at early intervention rather than prophylactic therapy to correct the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We attempted to achieve antithrombin III levels greater than 120% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant treatment-related morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall 100-day mortality for the treatment cohort was 17%, with 10% for the mild/moderate group and 39% for the severe group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the encouraging results of this study suggest that this antithrombin III treatment should be further considered in patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
