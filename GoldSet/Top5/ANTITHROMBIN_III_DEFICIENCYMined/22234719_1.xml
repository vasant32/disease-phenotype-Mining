<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impaired function or deficiency of this molecule significantly increases the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the genetic variability of SERPINC1 , the gene encoding antithrombin, to identify mutations affecting regulatory regions with functional effect on its levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sequenced 15,375 bp of this gene, including the potential promoter region, in three groups of subjects: five healthy subjects with antithrombin levels in the lowest (75%) and highest (115%) ranges of our population, 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and a moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> as the single thrombophilic defect, and two families with type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> who had neither mutations affecting exons or flanking regions, nor gross gene deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study confirmed the low genetic variability of SERPINC1 , particularly in the coding region, and its minor influence in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of antithrombin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in one family, we identified a g.2143 C&gt;G transversion, located 170 bp upstream from the translation initiation codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This mutation affected one of the four regions located in the minimal promoter that have potential regulatory activity according to previous DNase footprinting protection assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype analysis in the affected family and reporter analysis in different hepatic cell lines demonstrated that this mutation significantly impaired, although it did not abolish, the downstream transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this is the first mutation affecting a regulatory region of the SERPINC1 gene associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results strongly sustain the inclusion of the promoter region of SERPINC1 in the molecular analysis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
