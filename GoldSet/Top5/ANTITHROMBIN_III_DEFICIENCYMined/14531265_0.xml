<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (200 U.kg-1), the activated clotting time (ACT) increased from 124 to 436 sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it decreased to 128 sec immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bypass was discontinued because the addition of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (200 U.kg-1) proved <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The coronary artery bypass procedure was completed uneventfully without cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several recent articles have reported that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resistance was corrected with antithrombin III concentrates, fresh frozen plasma, or argatroban </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this case, these drugs could not be used because the mechanism of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resistance remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the off-pump technique is useful for unknown <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
