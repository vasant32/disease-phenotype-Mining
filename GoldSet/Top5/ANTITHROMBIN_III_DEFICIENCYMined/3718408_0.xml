<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> demonstrates a high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A renal AT III loss is an important pathogenetic factor in these events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with serumalbumin below 2.0 g/dl are mostly endangered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> oligoanuric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> low AT III-levels due to consumption were often found that lead to diminished protection against intravascular coagulation processes and can therefore contribute to progression of illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An AT III-substitution may be of some benefit in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally AT III was given in patients with dialysis-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> and low levels of AT III leading to a reduced incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the extracorporeal system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unnecessary high doses were also avoided and a minimal heparinization could be performed more efficiently in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, AT III-levels during renal transplantation and during organ rejection are reported </plain></SENT>
