<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An analysis was made of these three proteins in 239 cases of non-embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; the incidence of their deficiency and the presence of intersexual variations were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two different methods were used to measure PS, functional PS and free PS, comparing the values and the incidence of the deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ATIII, PC, free PS, and functional PS deficiencies were found in 2.93%, 7.5%, 9.52% and 13.72%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The observed PS values showed statistically significant differences between sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was a higher incidence of PS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiencies</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which were associated with a poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PS differed between sexes and both methods were valid for its quantitation </plain></SENT>
