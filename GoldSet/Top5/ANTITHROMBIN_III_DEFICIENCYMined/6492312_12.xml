<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deficiency of this circulating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> may be congenital; however, acquired deficiencies may develop in protein-losing or protein-<z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, AT-III levels of 108 patients undergoing vascular surgical procedures were determined preoperatively and at intervals (third, fifth, and seventh days) postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean AT-III level was then compared to the patient's protein status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of reduced AT-III activity on early graft failure was also noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A low preoperative AT-III level (less than 80%) was found in 16.3% of the patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 83 patients with serum albumin levels greater than 3.0 gm/dl or transferrin levels greater than 180 mg/dl, reduced AT-III activity was present in only 10 (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when serum albumin levels were less than 3.0 gm/dl, AT-III deficiency was found in 12 of 25 patients (48%) (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of a femorodistal graft occurred in 5 of 15 patients (33%) with reduced AT-III levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When AT-III levels were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, early bypass failure occurred in only 9 of 67 grafts (13.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An additional 15 patients had sequential pre- and postoperative measurements (up to 3 weeks) of serum protein and AT-III levels to illustrate the relationship between the dynamics of protein metabolism and AT-III levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a clear temporal relationship between albumin, transferrin, and AT-III levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
