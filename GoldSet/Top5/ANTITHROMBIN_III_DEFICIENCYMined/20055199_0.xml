<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report perioperative management for twice in a patient with congenital ATIII deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 69-year-old man with congenital ATIII deficiency, with history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) in his left popliteal vein, was scheduled for transurethral resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005695" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder tumor</z:e> (TUR-Bt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasma ATIII activity was 57% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As ATIII concentrates 3,000U per day had been administered intravenously since the second day before the operation, the plasma ATIII activity was 147% on the operation day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TUR-Bt was performed in the lithotomy position under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ATIII concentrates 3,000 U per day were administered intravenously for two days after the operation and low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) 2,500 U per day was administered subcutaneously for five days after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One year later he had a recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005695" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The plasma ATIII activity was 54% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ATIII concentrates 3,000 U per day had been administered intravenously since the three days before the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The second TUR-Bt was also performed in the lithotomy position under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ATIII concentrates 1,500 U per day were administered intravenously for three days after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LMWH was not administered due to postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from the bladder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>He had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> during each perioperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The lithotomy position with fixation of both hips and both knees may decrease venous blood flow, increase muscle compartment pressure of the lower extremities, predispose to DVT in the lower extremity, and lead to pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (PE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Control of blood coagulation and maintenance of sufficient venous blood flow in the lower extremities with ATIII adjuvant therapy and LMWH administration during the perioperative period are important for TUR-Bt in a patient with congenital ATIII deficiency to prevent DVT and PE </plain></SENT>
