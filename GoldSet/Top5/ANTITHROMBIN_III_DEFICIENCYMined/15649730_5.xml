<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Superior mesenteric vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (SMVT) is generally difficult to diagnose and can be fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mesenteric and portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is rare and can be presented as more serious conditions than that of SMVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report patients with combined SMVT and portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (PVT) who were treated successfully with early initiation of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of six patients (five male, one female) who presented with combined SMVT and PVT in our institute between January 1994 and September 2003 were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients were treated with early initiation of anticoagulation using unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean hospital stay was 31 days and the mean follow-up period was 32 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common symptom was diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and signs included <z:hpo ids='HP_0003270'>abdominal distension</z:hpo> and tenderness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, there were two patients who developed stricture of the small bowel necessitating resection and anastomosis of the small bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> due to bowel <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The early initiation of anticoagulation in patients of SMVT combined with PVT could minimise the serious complication such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> due to bowel <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> required immediate exploratory laparotomy </plain></SENT>
