<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clarification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood coagulation disorders</z:e> has been made progress based on newly developed technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ANTITHROMBIN III: In 1979, studies were carried out on antithrombin III(AT III) as a blood coagulation inhibitor from the first Japanese case of congenital AT III deficiency found in the laboratory sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An alternative <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> to maintain fluidity in extracorporeal circuit in an AT III deficient patient requiring hemodialysis was needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 1989, it was firstly introduced argatroban, a synthetic thrombin inhibitor as an alternative <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> instead of human antithrombin III concentrate plus <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> regimen during hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 1992, success of good delivery in pregnant woman with an AT III deficiency was obtained to maintain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of AT III by the concentrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DYSFIBRINOGENEMIA: Two families of congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011901'>dysfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> in clue to abnormally high levels of serum fibrinogen degradation products(FDP) were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polymerization detect due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011901'>dysfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> induced high level of serum FDP and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of fibrin d-dimer products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HEPARIN COFACTOR II DEFICIENCY: A patient with congenital <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II(HCII) deficiency was found in clue to four episodes of repeated restenosis under <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-anticoagulated coronary angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For preventing the restenosis, argatroban as an alternative of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was used during coronary angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No restenosis after the angioplasty was appeared in anticoagulation with argatroban </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis of the HCII was described that gene protein is secreted normally, but rapidly degraded in the circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FACTOR VII: In Japanese elderly, increase of Factor VII clotting activity was found to relate to high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Elevation of activated FVII(FVIIa) as an activation marker of FVII in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> indicates to be an independent risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HEPARIN INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA</z:e>: HIT: HIT is believed to be less frequent in Japanese because of lack of recognition due to poor understanding of HIT's paradox </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A survey in Japanese indicated to be no less frequent compared with that of the West </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A causativity for HIT has been identified as antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>As detection of the antibodies can easily be done by ELISA test, the test is desirable to become popular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Treatment for HIT is recommended to stop <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and start a thrombin inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In Japan, argatroban and nafamostat mesilate are selected as an alternative agent for HIT, but both drugs have no approval for Japanese HIT patients </plain></SENT>
