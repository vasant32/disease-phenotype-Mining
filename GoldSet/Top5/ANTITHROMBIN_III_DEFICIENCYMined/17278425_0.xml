<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antithrombin (AT) activity (AT: A) and AT antigen (AT: Ag) level in a Chinese family with type I antithrombin (AT) deficiency, and to explore the molecular mechanism of AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immuno-nephelometry and chromogenic assay were used to detect the plasma level of AT: A and AT: Ag, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the seven exons and exon-intron boundaries of AT gene were amplified by PCR and direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The plasma levels of AT: A and AT: Ag of the proband were 45% and 97 mg/L, respectively, which led to a type I AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A heterozygous T to A mutation was found at nucleotide 9833 in exon 5 resulting in a Tyr363Stop nonsense mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sequencing results from the pedigree indicated that four other members also had this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This heterozygous nonsense mutation of T9833A in exon 5 resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is a novel genetic defect of hereditary AT deficiency, which has not been described before </plain></SENT>
