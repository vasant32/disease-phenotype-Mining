<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disorder is associated with a significantly increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the molecular basis of type 1 AT deficiency in a Belgian family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of the disease was primarily made in a newborn girl with unusually severe thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, followed by direct sequencing of AT gene fragments, we identified a novel point mutation in exon 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We detected a G to C substitution in the first position of codon 424 leading to a glycine to arginine substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The modification at this highly conserved position in the serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> gene family probably leads to an unstable mutant-gene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation creates a unique restriction site for the enzyme Hha I in exon 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This change permitted a rapid and accurate screening of the kindred with identification of the molecular defect in five other family members </plain></SENT>
