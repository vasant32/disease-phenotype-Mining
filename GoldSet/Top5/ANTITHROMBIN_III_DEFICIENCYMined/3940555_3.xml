<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six healthy volunteers served as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">Sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE) and crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) showed the purified AT III to be homogeneous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Amino acid analysis of the protein revealed a composition identical to a highly purified internal standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specific activity was 5.6 U/mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of plasma radioactivity data was performed, using a three-compartment model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither plasma disappearance half-times nor fractional catabolic rate constants differed significantly between patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean absolute catabolic rate in the patient group was significantly lower than that of the control group at 2.57 +/- 0.44 and 4.46 +/- 0.80 mg/kg/day, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the mean patient alpha 1-phase, flux ratio (k1,2 and k2,1) of the second compartment alpha 2-phase and influx (k3,1) of the third compartment were significantly reduced as compared with control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It has been tentatively concluded that the observed reduction in the second compartment may be caused by a decrease in endothelial cell surface binding </plain></SENT>
