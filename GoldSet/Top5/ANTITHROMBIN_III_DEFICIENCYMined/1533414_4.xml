<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between these deficiencies and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> is a matter of current investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in 92 symptomatic patients belonging to a group of 160 with a confirmed diagnosis of hereditary deficiency of one of the physiologic clotting inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of them experienced at least one arterial thrombotic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This indicates that about one out of five of the symptomatic patients had experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 92 sex and age matched (+/- 5 years) patients with no clotting deficiency who had experienced in the same period at least one episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one of them had developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, upper and lower limb <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, and mesenteric <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> occurred regardless of the type of defect taken into account; mean age of about 37.05 +/- 23 years (mean +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In some cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall number of venous thrombotic events in the 92 symptomatic patients of this study was much higher than that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, with a ratio of 24 to 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of long-term <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy in our group of patients seemed to be able to prevent recurrences of both arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
