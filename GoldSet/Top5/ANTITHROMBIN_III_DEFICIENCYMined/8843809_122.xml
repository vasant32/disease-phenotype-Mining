<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since this system may be compromised by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disorders of haemostasis</z:e> associated with a prothrombotic state, we postulated that maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> might be a risk factor for fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the relation between heritable thrombophilic defects and fetal loss in a cohort of women with factor V Leiden or deficiency of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 1384 women enrolled in the European Prospective Cohort on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> (EPCOT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 843 women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> 571 had 1524 pregnancies; of 541 control women 395 had 1019 pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The controls were partners of male members of the EPCOT cohort or acquaintances of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We analysed the frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> (fetal loss at or before 28 weeks of gestation) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> (fetal loss after 28 weeks of gestation) jointly and separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The risk of fetal loss was increased in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (168/571 vs 93/395; odds ratio 1.35 [95% Cl 1.01-1.82]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio was higher for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> than for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> (3.6 [1.4-9.4] vs 1.27 [0.94-1.71]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The highest odds ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> was in women with combined defects (14.3 [2.4-86.0]) compared with 5.2 (1.5-18.1) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e>, 2.3 (0.6-8.3) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein-C deficiency</z:hpo>, 3.3 (1.0-11.3) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein-S deficiency</z:e>, and 2.0 (0.5-7.7) with factor V Leiden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The corresponding odds ratios for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> in these subgroups were 0.8 (0.2-3.6), 1.7 (1.0-2.8), 1.4 (0.9-2.2), 1.2 (0.7-1.9), and 0.9 (0.5-1.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significantly more pregnancy terminations had been done in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> than in controls (odds ratio 2.9 [1.8-4.8]); this discrepancy was apparent in nine of 11 participating centres and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Women with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, especially those with combined defects or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e>, have an increased risk of fetal loss, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our findings have important implications for therapy and provide a rationale for clinical trials of thromboprophylaxis for affected women with recurrent fetal loss </plain></SENT>
