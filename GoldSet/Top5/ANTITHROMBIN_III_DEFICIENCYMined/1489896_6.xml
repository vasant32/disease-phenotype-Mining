<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A congenital deficiency state known to predispose to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was found in 27.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, most were due to deficiencies of protein C (9.2%), protein S (7.6%), antithrombin III (5%) or to increased plasma PAI-1 concentration (3.1%) which, in the absence of any known factor that predisposes towards <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, results in a diminished fibrinolytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a characteristic pattern between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> (mean 34 years) of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> appeared spontaneously in 73% of cases with recurrence in 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the remaining unrelated patients, 138 (35.1%) in whom venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was secondary and occurred at a mean age of 43 years, and in the other 140 (35.6%) who suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> spontaneously at a later age (mean age 55), there was no permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein deficiency</z:e> state or alteration in fibrinolytic activity and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> recurrence was lower (53.6% and 20.7% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 393 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> was the most common manifestation; however, in congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of visceral vessels and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034734" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's syndrome</z:e> (6%) were also detected </plain></SENT>
