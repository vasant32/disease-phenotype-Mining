<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the antithrombin (AT) gene in 9 unrelated Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 7 exons, the splice junctions, and the 5'-flanking region of the AT gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine different point mutations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the heterozygous state, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five novel (M-32T, M89K, L146H, Q159X, and L409P) and 2 previously reported (R132X and R359X) point mutations were identified in patients with type 1 deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two different missense mutations, R393C and R393H, located in the protease reactive site were detected in patients with type 2 deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No other sequence abnormalities in the AT gene were detected by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the mutations was present in 100 alleles from 50 unrelated Japanese control subjects Although type 1 deficiency was diagnosed in patient 7 on the basis of approximately 50% AT antigen and activity levels, the data indicated that the novel L409P mutation is a type 2 pleiotropic effects (PE) deficiency because its location in the C-terminal portion of the reactive site is similar to the locations of reported PE type mutations, and it is highly conserved among other serpins </plain></SENT>
