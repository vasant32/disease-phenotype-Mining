<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin-III activity was 43% and its antigen level was 12.2 mg/dl, was diagnosed so type I <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin-IIIdeficiency</z:hpo> was diagnosed.Methods: A dose of 2500 U of antithrombin-III concentrate was administered at 1 day before surgery, 1 hour before surgery, and 1 day after surgery </plain></SENT>
