<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and DNA sequencing, the molecular basis of hereditary type Ia antithrombin III (AT III) deficiency was disclosed in two families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One mutation was a change from T to A in the codon of TTA for Leu 140 forming a stop codon of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>, which was confirmed by mutated primer-mediated PCR-HindIII digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The application of this method demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four affected members had the mutant allele in a heterozygous state and that none of unaffected subjects had this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another mutation in the second family was a change from C to T in the codon of CGA for Arg 197 also forming a stop codon of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, which was confirmed by PCR-HaeIII digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on these, it was concluded that the two new nonsense mutations in the AT III gene in a heterozygous state are the molecular basis of hereditary type Ia AT III deficiency </plain></SENT>
