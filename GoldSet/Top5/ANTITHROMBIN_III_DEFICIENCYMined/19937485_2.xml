<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> which were screened in young adult patients presenting with thrombotic events or with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortions</z:e> with unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 115 patients aged between 16 and 50 years who were found to harbor <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The laboratory investigations performed for the assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> included protein C, protein S, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiencies</z:hpo>, activated protein C resistance, factor V Leiden (FVL), prothrombin 20210A (PT 20210) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations, factor VIII elevation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 66% of the cases a single thrombophilic defect was identified while some of the patients had combined thrombophilic defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common thrombophilic defect was mutation in the MTHFR gene, and was followed by FVL mutation, the presence of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> and PT 20210 gene mutation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two different age groups, 16-35 and 36-50 years, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was more common in the older age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that some important thrombophilic defects such as gene mutations may appear in young adult patients presenting with thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
