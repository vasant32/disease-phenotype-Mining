<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with placental form and structure and with hematologic values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the SGA infants, a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011416'>placental infarction</z:hpo> (P less than 0.01), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> (P less than 0.005), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (P less than 0.001) was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the first 9 days, the mean antithrombin III level in the AGA group increased from 0.36 to 0.53 U/ml, whereas in SGA neonates this value was initially significantly lower (0.27 U/ml) and remained at that level for the entire observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same pattern was found for alpha 2-antiplasmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The persistent AT-III deficiency and reduced blood flow associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> may explain the increased risk of thromboembolic complications in SGA infants described by others </plain></SENT>
