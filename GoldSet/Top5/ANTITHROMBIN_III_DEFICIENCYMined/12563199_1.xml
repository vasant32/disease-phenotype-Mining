<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients from January 1994 to January 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five hundred eighty-two infrainguinal bypass grafts were created in 456 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indication for surgery was limb-threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in 84%; prosthetic conduits were implanted in 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four grafts were created in 57 patients with one or more serologically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e>, including <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation (n = 37), anticardiolipin antibodies (n = 11), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (n = 8), protein C or S deficiency (n = 7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> (n = 3), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> were younger (63 +/- 2 years versus 69 +/- 1 years; P =.007), more likely to have undergone prior revascularization attempts (38% versus 21%; P =.003), and more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> anticoagulation therapy after surgery (46% versus 25%; P =.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 5 years (median follow-up, 19 months), patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> had poorer primary patency (28% +/- 7% versus 35% +/- 5%; P =.004), primary assisted patency (37% +/- 7% versus 45% +/- 6%; P =.0001), secondary patency (41% +/- 7% versus 53% +/- 6%; P =.0001), limb salvage (55% +/- 8% versus 67% +/- 6%; P =.009), and survival (61% +/- 8% versus 74% +/- 4%; P =.02) rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified only prosthetic conduit choice (P =.0001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> (P =.0003), and limb salvage indication (P =.01) as independent predictors of graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with serologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> have inferior long-term patency, limb salvage, and survival rates after infrainguinal bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence rate (13%) of diverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e> in this patient population supports serologic screening, especially in referral practices </plain></SENT>
