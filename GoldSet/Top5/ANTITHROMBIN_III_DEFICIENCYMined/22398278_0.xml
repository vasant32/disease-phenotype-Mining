<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Based on information from a tertiary teaching unit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recorded cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (PE) during pregnancy diagnosed between 1997 and 2005, were assessed for prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five healthy women, who had at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy but without any previous history of VTE, were recruited as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 44 subjects completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> screening, of whom 5 (11%) were confirmed to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> [protein C (PC) deficiency (2), protein S (PS) deficiency (1), combined PC &amp; PS deficiency (1) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> (1)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homozygous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12071">5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (C677T) gene mutation was found in 6 (14%) subjects but not in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, activated PC resistance, factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the Chinese population, PS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiencies</z:e> are common <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> for VTE during pregnancy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> screening should be recommended in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pregnant women who suffer from VTE </plain></SENT>
