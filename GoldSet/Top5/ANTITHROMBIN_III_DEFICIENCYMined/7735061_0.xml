<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined antithrombin III levels in women suffering from pregnancy induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> to determine its usefulness in assessing severity of the disease and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five pregnant women with mild and severe forms of pregnancy induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and 18 women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancies matched for gestational age formed the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood samples were collected and the plasma separated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III levels were estimated by the kinetic Berichrom antithrombin III method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean (SD) antithrombin III levels [0.76 (0.233) IU/ml] were significantly lower in pregnancy induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> compared to the control group [0.97 (0.234) IU/ml] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low antithrombin III and high diastolic blood pressure (&gt; 110 mmHg) were related to poor pregnancy outcome in primigravidae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mean antithrombin III levels were lower in pregnancy induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> compared to a control group of women especially those who were primigravidae and had a diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since low antithrombin III levels and a high diastolic blood pressure result in adverse pregnancy outcome monitoring of antithrombin III levels in pregnancy induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may help in assessing foetal jeopardy </plain></SENT>
