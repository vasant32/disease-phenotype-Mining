<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AT III activity and concentration were measured in 36 patients (mean age 65.5 yrs, range 43-77 yrs) with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within maximally 48 h of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients (= 33%) AT III activity was reduced below 18.4 IU/ml: 50% of these patients showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 50% reduced AT III concentration of less than 22 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients AT III activity and concentration were measured in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase on admission to hospital and 12 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, AT III activity was reduced when compared with AT III concentration (y = 0.19 chi + 15.5) and did not correlate with the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>12 months later, however, AT III activity and concentration correlated significantly (r = 0.92; p less than 0.001) and the regression line was steeper (y = 0.8 chi) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, intravascular coagulation is evidently increased and inactive AT III-thrombin complexes are formed, whereby the concentration of active AT III decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A patient with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and reduced AT III activity of 14.2 IU/ml was therefore substituted with AT III concentrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The further neurological course was favourable </plain></SENT>
