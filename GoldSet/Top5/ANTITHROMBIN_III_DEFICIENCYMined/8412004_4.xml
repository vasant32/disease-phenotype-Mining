<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a Japanese brother and sister with a CDG syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients showed decreased activities of blood coagulation Factor XI and of the coagulation inhibitor protein C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one of them there was also a somewhat decreased activity of Factor IX and of antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Isoelectric focusing of antithrombin III revealed a decrease of negatively charged fractions and an increase of more cathodal bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was a discrepancy between activity and antigen level of Factor VIII and protein C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients had an incidental deficiency of factor XII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first detailed report on blood coagulation systems in the CDG syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These blood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> may explain at least in part the thrombotic or haemorrhagic complications of the CDG syndromes </plain></SENT>
