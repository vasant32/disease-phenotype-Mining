<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism at work is complex, involving endotoxin or <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> constituents that damage vascular endothelium and activate intrinsic coagulation, platelet function and the release of leucocyte coagulation-promoting compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activation of coagulation in turn activates prekallikrein and complement and plays a part in shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The laboratory plays an essential role in diagnosing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, determining its repercussions on the parameters of haemostasis and in monitoring its course under antibiotics, which in some cases may be combined with carefully controlled <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitive and specific tests are the assays for fibrinogen-fibrin degradation products (FDP) and soluble complexes (SC) using the haemagglutination test or the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The platelet count should be combined with measurement of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A varying degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0003179'>thrombopenia</z:mp> is frequent but non specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath>, it is an early warning sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A selective fall in proaccelerin is an indirect early sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A fall in antithrombin III (AT III) is considered a good sign of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> but it does not occur in every case, and is most liable to be present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From the FDP and fibrinogen results, it should be clear whether one is dealing with compensated, decompensated or even over-compensated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis should be complemented by a careful search for the clinical signs of coagulation and haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is indispensable for investigations to be repeated every 6-12 hours, for the sake both of treatment strategy, which can be extremely difficult, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> monitoring </plain></SENT>
