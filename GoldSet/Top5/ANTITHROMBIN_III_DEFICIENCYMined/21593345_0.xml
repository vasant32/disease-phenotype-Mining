<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Determining the patterns of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> may improve screening strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: An unselected cohort of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> patients in three tertiary institutions in Singapore was prospectively tested for the prevalence of deficiencies of protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, factor V Leiden and prothrombin 20210 gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 384 patients screened, the prevalences of protein S, protein C and antithrombin III were 9.20%, 1.18% and 4.19% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one patient was positive for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> and none tested positive for the prothrombin 20210 gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At least 1 in 9 patients (11.52%, 95% CI 8.20 to 15.93) will test positive for one of the above markers in an unselected group of 269 patients who completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The exclusion of patients with clinical risk factors did not improve the detection rates, in comparison with those with obvious provoking clinical risk factors (11.72%, 95% CI 7.36 to 18.06 vs 11.29%, 95% CI 6.73 to 18.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When upper age limits were set for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> screening by decades, a statistical difference in the likelihood of a positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> screen between younger and older patient was seen for patients below 40 (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In Singapore and countries with similar demographics, hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> screening should be confined to testing for protein C, protein S and antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
