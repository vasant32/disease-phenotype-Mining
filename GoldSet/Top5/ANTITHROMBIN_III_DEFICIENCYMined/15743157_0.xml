<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> is defined as an altered hemostasis that predisposes to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can be primary when there is a family clustering of the disease or secondary, when it is associated to an acquired risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To report clinical features in a series of patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of clinical records of patients with thrombotic episodes that lead to the suspicions of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of asymptomatic adult close relatives of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report 93 subjects (56 females, age range 14-77 years) with repeated episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 12 asymptomatic close relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy one percent had the first thrombotic episode before the age of 40 years, 62% had more than one thrombotic episode and 37% had a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty four percent had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, 24% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, 18% had resistance to activated C protein by factor V Leiden, 10% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, and 10% had the G20210 mutation of prothrombin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among acquired defects studied simultaneously, 30% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and 11% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty four percent of cases had more than one thrombophilic risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among asymptomatic relatives, five had factor V Leiden, four had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> and three had the G20210 mutation of prothrombin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> must be suspected in young subjects with thrombotic episodes and a family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation defect</z:e> will determine prognosis, and the type of treatment </plain></SENT>
