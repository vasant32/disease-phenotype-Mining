<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially the anomaly seemed to be homogeneous and simple: the three main characteristics of AT-III (thrombin inactivating and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity, antigen concentration) were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This type of AT-III deficiency (type 1) was later divided into type 1a and 1b on the basis of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> affinity of the AT-III molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first family with a different qualitative AT-III disorder (type 2) was described by our group in 1974 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the members of this family the AT-III antigen concentration was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but the molecule had no functional activity (AT-III Budapest) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the last few years some new variants of type 2 hereditary AT-III disorders have been observed; they are characterized by a loss of one or more functional properties of the AT-III molecule </plain></SENT>
