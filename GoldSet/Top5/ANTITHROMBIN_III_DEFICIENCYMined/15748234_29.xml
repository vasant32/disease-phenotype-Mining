<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reliable risk estimates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in families with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> are scarce but necessary for determining optimal screening and treatment policies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In the present analysis, we determined the risk of a first venous thrombotic event in carriers of a thrombophilic defect (i.e. antithrombin-, protein C- or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, or factor V Leiden) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The asymptomatic carriers had been tested prior to this study in nine European <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> centers because of a symptomatic carrier in the family, and were followed prospectively for 5.7 years on average between March 1994 and January 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Annually, data were recorded on the occurrence of risk situations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and events (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six of the 575 asymptomatic carriers (4.5%) and seven of the 1118 controls (0.6%) experienced a first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these events, 58% occurred spontaneously in the carriers compared with 43% in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of first events was 0.8% per year (95% CI 0.5-1.2) in the carriers compared with 0.1% per year (95% CI 0.0-0.2) in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest incidence was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> or combined defects, and the lowest incidence with factor V Leiden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of venous events in asymptomatic individuals from thrombophilic families does not exceed the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> associated with long-term <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment in the literature (1-3%) </plain></SENT>
