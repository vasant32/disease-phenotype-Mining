<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In congenital or acquired antithrombin III-deficient patients undergoing haemodialysis, coagulation or residual blood in the blood circuit and dialyser is commonly observed under anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Argatroban, a synthetic thrombin <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, directly inhibits thrombin activity in a manner that is different from that of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, thereby displaying an anticoagulating effect without the activation of antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this reason, the anticoagulating effect of argatroban in haemodialysis patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective nationwide survey was conducted among patients with congenital or acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> who had undergone haemodialysis with argatroban as an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> from April 1996 to April 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were patients with antithrombin III activity &lt;70% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and patients in whom blood coagulation or residual blood in the extracorporeal circuit could not be prevented by the use of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during haemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 80 patients who underwent haemodialysis with argatroban, 59 met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the data before the administration of argatroban, significant improvements of residual blood in the dialyser and arterial and venous drip chambers were observed at the last administration of argatroban </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant rise in antithrombin III activity was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 80 safety analysis cases, no adverse events were reported in 66 patients (82.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As severe adverse events, one showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo> and one had prolongation of prothrombin time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Argatroban was an effective and safe <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> for haemodialysis in patients with congenital or acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
