<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Superior vena cava (SVC) reconstructions are rarely performed; therefore the need for surveillance and the results of secondary interventions are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 14-year period 19 patients (11 male, 8 female; mean age 41.9 years, range 8 to 69 years) underwent SVC reconstruction for symptomatic nonmalignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Causes included mediastinal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (n = 12), indwelling foreign bodies (n = 4), idiopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n = 2), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spiral saphenous vein graft (n = 14), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (n = 4), or human allograft (n = 1) was implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four early graft stenoses or thromboses (spiral saphenous vein graft, n = 2, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi>, n = 2) required thrombectomy, with success in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 49.5 months (range, 4.7 to 137 months), 95 imaging studies were performed (average, five per patient; range, one to 10 studies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Venography detected mild or moderate graft stenosis in seven patients; two progressed to severe stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two additional grafts developed early into severe stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of 19 grafts occluded during follow-up (two <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi>, two spiral saphenous vein graft) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography failed to identify stenosis in two grafts, magnetic resonance imaging failed to confirm one stenosis and one graft occlusion, and duplex scanning was inconclusive on graft patency in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients with severe stenosis, with simultaneous placement of Wallstents in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One of the Wallstents occluded at 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Repeat percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was necessary in two patients, with placement of Palmaz stents in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Only one graft occlusion and one severe graft stenosis occurred beyond 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency rates were 61%, 78%, and 83% at 1 year and 53%, 70%, and 74% at 5 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Long-term secondary patency rates justify SVC grafting for benign disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Postoperative surveillance with contrast venography is indicated in the first year to detect graft problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Endovascular techniques may salvage and improve the patency of SVC grafts </plain></SENT>
