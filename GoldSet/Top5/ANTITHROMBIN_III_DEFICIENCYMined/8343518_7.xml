<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have determined the dissociation constants, Kd, of 48.8 nM for the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-AT III interaction, of 175 nM for the specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35369">pentasaccharide</z:chebi>-AT III interaction, and of 13 microM for the low-affinity <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-AT III interaction, using a binding assay based on a monoclonal antibody (MAb) that recognizes an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> at or close to the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding site of AT III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding affinities and proportions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and variant AT III in plasma from patients with mutations of AT III have been quantitated for the first time using the binding assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Substitution mutations in three regions of AT III have been investigated: (i) mutations in the reactive site loop affecting Ala382, Arg393, and Ser394 have no discernible effect on <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding; (ii) mutations in the previously identified N-terminal <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding region, affecting Arg47, Leu99, and Arg129, produce variant AT III molecules with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> affinities reduced 11-924-fold, the largest reduction being observed for the substitution mutation Arg47-Cys in Padua 2, which has an affinity of 65.6 microM; (iii) mutations in the hydrophobic regions around strand 1C of the C terminus, affecting Phe402, Ala404, Asn405, Pro407, and Pro429, have pleiotropic effects that include the production of reduced amounts of low-affinity AT III with dissociation constants from 6 to 43 microM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
