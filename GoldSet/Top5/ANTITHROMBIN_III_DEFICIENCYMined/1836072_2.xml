<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the exceptional finding of two cases of triple deficiency: ATIII combined with HCII and PC in the first case aged 15 and ATIII combined with HCII and PS in the second case aged 27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, both are asymptomatic thus far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five other deficient members were found, among which seven are affected with a double deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Totally, the results of our study show 38 deficiencies of four distinct antithrombotic protein: ATIII (n = 9), HCII (n = 9), PC (n = 7) or PS (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two types of HCII deficiency were observed and type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional PS deficiency was characterized by reduced levels of cofactor activity for activated PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our report demonstrates that combined deficiencies should be sought in a family already known to be deficient in one antithrombotic protein </plain></SENT>
