<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Annual incidences (95% confidence interval) of recurrent venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were 8.4% (5.8-11.7) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, 6.0% (3.9-8.7) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, 10.0% (6.1-15.4) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e>, and overall 7.7% (6.1-9.5) </plain></SENT>
