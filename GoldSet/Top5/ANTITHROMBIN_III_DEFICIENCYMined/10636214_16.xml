<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> deficiencies, activated protein C resistance (APCR), and factor V Leiden play a role in the development of PVT, leading to cavernous transformation of the portal vein (CTPV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients with idiopathic CTPV (group 1) seen at Hacettepe University Hospital during the past 12 years were identified and prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These 23 patients underwent a detailed hematological evaluation including measurement of protein S, protein C, antithrombin III, activated protein C resistance (APCR), and factor V Leiden gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were tested for anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), IgG, IgM, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Natural <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and APCR were measured using available commercial kits, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> (R506Q) was detected by Mnl I digestion of an amplified factor V DNA fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> parameters were measured at least 6 months after the diagnosis of CTPV was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient was on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or antiaggregant treatment while tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings in these 23 patients were compared with those in 20 healthy control subjects (group 2), in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tests mentioned above were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 23 patients (group 1), who had no recognizable factor for portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, considerably natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> deficiencies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> positivity were found when we compare them to those healthy controls (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The protein C levels of six patients (26%), the protein S levels of 10 patients (43.5%), and the antithrombin III levels of five patients (26%) were lower than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients were found to have combined protein S and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, and one had combined protein S and C deficiency and APCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>APCR was detected in seven of the 23 patients, and six of these seven patients were found to have R506Q <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutations</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In group 1, ACA IgG levels were higher in four patients (17%) and ACA IgM level was higher in one (4%) compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LA was positive in only one patient in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> deficiencies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> are strongly associated with PVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> deficiencies and APCR (almost totally caused by R506Q mutation) produce a favorable medium for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>PVT seems to be related to the natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> deficiencies and factor V Leiden R506Q mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A combination of these defects increases the incidence of PVT and these factors should be evaluated carefully in patients with idiopathic CTPV </plain></SENT>
