<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Missense mutations causing conformational alterations in serpins can be responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein deficiency</z:e> associated with human diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are few data about conformational consequences of mutations affecting antithrombin, the main hemostatic serpin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the conformational and clinical effect of mutations affecting the shutter region of antithrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients and methods: We identified two families with significant reduction of circulating antithrombin displaying early and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, frequently associated with pregnancy or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations were determined by standard molecular methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biochemical studies were performed on plasma samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One variant (P80S) was purified by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-affinity chromatography and gel filtration, and evaluated by proteomic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we modelled the structure of the mutant dimer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified two missense mutations affecting the shutter region of antithrombin: P80S and G424R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Carriers of both mutations presented traces of a similar abnormal antithrombin, supporting inefficiently expressed rather than non-expressed variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The abnormal antithrombin purified from P80S carriers is an inactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-linked dimer of mutant antithrombin whose properties are consistent with head-to-head insertion of the reactive loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the conclusion that missense mutations affecting the shutter region of serpins have specific conformational effects resulting in the formation of mutant oligomers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The consequent inefficiency of secretion explains the accompanying deficiency and loss of function, but the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with these mutations suggests that the oligomers also have new and undefined pathological properties that could be exacerbated by pregnancy or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
