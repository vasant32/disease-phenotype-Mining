<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of increasing recognition of protein C (PC) as an important, naturally occurring <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and fibrinolytic factor, we studied plasma PC in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PC antigen concentration and its <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity were measured in nine SCI men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> maintained on hemodialysis and in a control group of ten <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> able-bodied men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed a significant increase in PC <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity in the SCI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the ratio of the PC activity to its concentration, which is a measure of the functional integrity of PC molecule, was markedly depressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings are indicative of the presence of inactive or abnormal PC in SCI-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> patients and may suggest its in vivo activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of impaired PC activity shown in this study, with previously demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo>, is suggestive of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
