<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis of quantitative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> was investigated in four families predicted to have major antithrombin gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 1,442 bp deletion and insertion of the sequence 5'T(n = 38-40)GAGACG was characterised in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequence surrounding the breakpoints contained two perfect, and one imperfect, inverted repeats which may have mediated formation of a stem loop structure on one strand during DNA replication potentiating the deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 9,219 bp deletion spanning introns 2 to 5 was identified in a second family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The identical 6 bp sequence was upstream of each breakpoint and the 5' breakpoint was located in a sequence of the Alu 3 repeat predicted to be susceptible to strand breakage during transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This may have promoted misalignment, and deletion, of one of the repeats and the intervening DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A novel 1.8 kb antithrombin gene fragment was present in DNA digests from affected members of the third family suggesting a partial antithrombin gene duplication event while in the remaining family, evidence supporting a complete gene deletion was obtained </plain></SENT>
