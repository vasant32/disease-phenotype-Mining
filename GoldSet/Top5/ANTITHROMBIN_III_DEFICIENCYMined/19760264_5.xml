<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 2000 and 2008, 86 probands suspected of having AT-inherited type I deficiency were screened for SERPINC1 mutations in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations causally linked to the deficiency were identified by sequencing analysis in 63 probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present here results of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis performed in 22 of the 23 remaining probands, in whom sequencing had revealed no mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Large deletions, present at the heterozygous state, were detected in 10 patients: whole gene deletions in 5 and partial deletions removing either exon 6 (n = 2), exons 1-2 (n = 1) or exons 5-7 (n = 2) in 5 others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exon 6 partial deletions are a 2,769-bp deletion and a 1,892-bp deletion associated with a 10-bp insertion, both having 5' and/or 3' breakpoints located within Alu repeat elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we identified the 5' breakpoint of a previously reported deletion of exons 1-2 within an extragenic Alu repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Distinct mutational mechanisms explaining these Alu sequence-related deletions are proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, in this series, large deletions detected by MLPA explain almost half of otherwise unexplained type I AT-inherited deficiency cases </plain></SENT>
