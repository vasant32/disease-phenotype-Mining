<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Recent studies from Europe have demonstrated that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> who receive a kidney transplant are at an increased risk for rejection and graft loss when compared with patients who have no known <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of anticoagulation has not been investigated in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively tested patients who were evaluated for a kidney transplant for 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo>, protein S and C deficiencies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, anticardiolipin antibody, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, prothrombin gene mutation, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibody</z:hpo> (HIPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with any identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or argatroban (for HIPA (+) patients) followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">coumadin</z:chebi> for 1 year after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Triple therapy included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, and CellCept (Roche Pharmaceuticals, Nutley, NJ, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitized, black, or repeat transplantation patients received induction with an interleukin (IL)-2 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were collected in a retrospective manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rejection was biopsy-proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 112 transplant recipients who were tested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, 37 had 1 or more <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and 75 had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and 11 received argatroban </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in recipient age, cold storage time, graft loss, HLA match, rejection episodes, 1-year graft survival, or serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were noted in posttransplantation <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, 35% versus 5%, and delayed graft function, 32% versus 15%, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> versus no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate that there is no increase in rejection or graft loss in kidney transplant recipients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> when treated with anticoagulation and triple immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
