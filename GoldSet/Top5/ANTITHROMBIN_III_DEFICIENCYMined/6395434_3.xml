<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A technique is described to completely remove antithrombin III (AT) from small amounts of human plasma by immunoaffinity chromatography on antibodies against human AT linked to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> 4B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II (HCII) was not affected by the immunoadsorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HCII activity was then determined by measuring the rate of human thrombin inhibition by 3 ways: a) activation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in AT-free plasma, b) activation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18376">dermatan sulfate</z:chebi> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma and c) activation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18376">dermatan sulfate</z:chebi> in AT-free plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of HCII varied between 0.7-1.5 U/ml, as compared to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma pool containing by definition 1 U/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Highly significant correlations between assays as obtained from 40 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasmas proved the suitability of the 3 assays, although the progressive thrombin inhibition by AT, when not removed, contributed about one fifth to the thrombin inhibition by HCII in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18376">dermatan sulfate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were also highly significant correlations between HCII activity and antigen, as determined by rocket immunoelectrophoresis using specific antibodies against HCII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of HCII and AT were examined in 7 patients with hereditary AT deficiency and 7 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In hereditary AT deficiency, whereas the AT activity was reduced by half, levels of HCII activity and antigen were in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, a parallel decrease of HCII and AT suggests that HCII may participate in the inhibition of thrombin released during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> and thus provides an inhibitor reserve, once the AT level becomes subnormally low </plain></SENT>
