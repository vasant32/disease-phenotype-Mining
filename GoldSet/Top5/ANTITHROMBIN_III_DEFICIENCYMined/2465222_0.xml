<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The findings were described and compared, multifold in manual techniques happened breaks caused by occluded tubules were accompanied with decrease of antithrombin III and positive FM-tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was discussed, if apheresis-techniques for themselves (extracorporal multifold manipulation in manual techniques and contact with artificial surfaces in both kinds of techniques) can be the reason for a hypercoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It seems to be important, how is the situation of apheresis-donor before starting, therefore we give the recommendation, to pay more attention in examination this kind of donors, additional with testing antithrombin III levels and tests for fibrin-monomers </plain></SENT>
