<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> (BCS) is often missed unless its possibility has been kept in mind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Obstruction of inferior vena cava (IVC) is reportedly the most frequent cause of BCS in Afro-Asian variety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: An attempt was made to classify BCS (in an eastern Indian population) etiopathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty consecutive cases of BCS presenting over a period of five years were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following a thorough physical examination, necessary investigations (including coagulation profile, ultrasonography (with Doppler study) of hepatobiliary tract, hepatic vein and IVC angiography (n = 22) and liver biopsy (n = 26, including autopsy in two cases) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age at presentation was 32.7 +/- 10.36 years (range 12-60 years) with M:F = 21:9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentations included, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> in 28 (93.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> in 27 (90%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> in 15 (50%), pain in abdomen in 26 (86.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> in 10 (33.3%), back veins in 20 (66.6%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> in three (10%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Amongst the total of 30 patients, four, six and 20 cases presented as fulminant, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> BCS respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty four cases of BCS could be diagnosed by ultrasonography alone, while the remainder required angiography for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IVC and hepatic vein angiography revealed membranous obstruction in nine, partial stricture of IVC in six, and IVC and/or hepatic vein block in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The etiopathological nature in 30 cases were as follows: idiopathic membranous obstruction in nine (30%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> in six (20%), idiopathic stricture in six (20%) cases and one case (3.3%) each of the following: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_354'>cholangiocarcinoma</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo>, hydatid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> in liver, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, oral contraceptive use, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> (with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> rubra vera and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Idiopathic membranous obstruction and stricture of IVC are the commonest cause of BCS in the eastern part of India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>Hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> is also a common cause, presenting in the fulminant form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography may be a helpful screening test for BCS, but IVC and hepatic vein catheterisation is essential for a complete work up of these patients </plain></SENT>
