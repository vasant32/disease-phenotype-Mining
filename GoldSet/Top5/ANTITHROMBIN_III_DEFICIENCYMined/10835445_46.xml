<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> risk factors in 65 unrelated children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> compared with 145 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients and control subjects were tested for antithrombin protein C and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiencies</z:e>, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APLA), factor V Leiden (FVL), G20210A polymorphism of factor II gene (FII G20210A), and C677T polymorphism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12071">5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase gene (C677T MTHFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 65 children, 7 had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the neonatal/perinatal period and therefore were analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one of the remaining 58 patients with pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (53.4%) were found to have at least 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> marker compared with only 25.5% of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the patients or control subjects had protein S or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> was higher among pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients than among control subjects, but the difference was not statistically significant (OR=7, 95% CI 0.75 to 65.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous FII G20210A and homozygous MTHFR 677T were not associated with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR=1.29, 95% CI 0.2 to 8.2; and OR=1.06, 95% CI 0.4 to 2.7, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the presence of APLA was associated with a &gt;6-fold risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR=6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>08, 95% CI 1.5 to 24.3), and the heterozygosity for FVL increased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by almost 5-fold (OR=4.82, 95% CI 1.4 to 16.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients with pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had a combination of &gt; or =2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> markers, whereas none of the control subjects had a combination of the markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients with neonatal/perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were found to have at least 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> markers is increased in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with control subjects and, specifically, that FVL and APLA contribute significantly to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurrence </plain></SENT>
