<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentration of the major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> of the coagulation mechanism, antithrombin III, is substantially decreased in patients receiving this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This observation has generated speculation that L-asparaginase may induce a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine this hypothesis, we studied ten patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153876" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ALL in remission</z:e> who were being treated with the above chemotherapeutic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data revealed that infusion of this enzyme leads to a marked decrease in the plasma concentrations of prothrombin as well as antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, we have also observed a constant level of thrombin generation during the same period of time as monitored by plasma levels of prothrombin activation fragment (F1 + 2) and thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based upon these findings we suggest that administration of L-asparaginase does not usually lead to the induction of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
