<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient developed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the left leg, but fibrinopeptide A (FPA) and thrombin-AT III complex (TAT) had already shown high values one week before, suggesting the possibility of their being forecast markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The administration of AT III concentrate caused an improvement in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in case of high FPA and TAT values as determined one or two times a week, the administration of AT III concentrate was thought necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In case of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, however, non-administration during the 6th-9th <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1135241" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">weeks of gestation</z:e> for the purpose of avoiding teratogenicity and frequent blood coagulation tests taking heed of overdosage for the purpose of avoiding fetal central <z:mp ids='MP_0000768'>nervous system abnormalities</z:mp> were suggested necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Delivery was uneventful, both mother and child being doing very well; umbilical blood AT III activity was 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is generally difficult for us to form the diagnosis as AT III deficiency only from AT III activity at neonatal stage, but in the present study, we analyzed the restriction fragment length polymorphism of the AT III gene using umbilical blood, and succeeded in diagnosing the neonatal child as AT III deficiency </plain></SENT>
