<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AT III <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activities were close to 50% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the father, mother, another brother and a sister, none of whom had experienced thrombotic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available members of the family, including the patient, displayed near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT III antigen levels (73-85%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> total progressive antithrombin activities (92-110%) as assessed by the thrombin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> diffusion technique and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> total progressive anti-Xa activities, the propositus and his brother could be considered to be homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for a qualitative familial AT III deficiency probably caused by an abnormality of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding site </plain></SENT>
