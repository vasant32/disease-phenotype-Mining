<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wanted to determine whether this was applicable to our population with CF and how our patients compared to the previously reported groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy one pediatric CF patients were assessed for a thrombophilic tendency, using a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> screen, protein C, protein S, antithrombin assay, and activated protein C resistance (APCR) screen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of activate protein C resistance (4.2%) was within expected limits for the general population as was the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However there was a marked increase in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (18%) and 14% and 19.7% of the patients showed a reduced protein C and protein S, respectively, far in excess of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was not related to any specific CF phenotype and while perturbed liver function cannot be entirely ruled out, it appeared unlikely to be responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">abnormal coagulation</z:e> findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the apparent thrombophilic tendency, no clinically evident thrombotic episodes were noted during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> is of concern because of the increasingly frequent placement of indwelling catheters in CF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The precise cause for the thrombophilic tendency in CF patients is unknown at this stage </plain></SENT>
