<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The FV Leiden was found in fifty-five from among 127 persons (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two from 53 (68%) family carriers of FV Leiden had venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> at the time of examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined defects were found in 6 out of 14 families (in 4 families coexistence of FV Leiden mutation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, in 1 with G20210 A mutation of prothrombin gene and in 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Until now 63% (7/11) of combined defect carriers (mean age 48.5 years) and 59% (24/42) of heterozygous FV Leiden carriers (mean age 52.2 years) have been symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-free survival (Kaplan-Maier analysis) was comparable in combined and in single defect carriers groups </plain></SENT>
