<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to report on the practical experience gained in performing genetic analyses of a large cohort of patients with AT, PC and PS deficiencies and to relate this knowledge to clinical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We genotyped a large cohort of 709 unrelated patients with AT (231), PC (234) and PS (244) deficiencies referred to us by physicians throughout Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations were detected by direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest mutation detection rate (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>) was found for the SERPINC1 gene (83.5%), followed by the PROC (69%) and PROS1 (43%) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even at AT activities close to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (75%), the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> was 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contrastingly, for PC and PS deficiencies, the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> dropped significantly and mildly lowered to subnormal values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At PS activities &gt;55% for PS no mutations were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutation profiles of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three genes were similar with the highest prevalence for missense mutations (63-78%), followed by nonsense (7-11%), splice-site mutations (7-13%), small deletions (1-8%), small insertions/duplications (1-4%) and large deletions (3-6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, genetic testing is a useful diagnostic tool for diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on our data, genetic analysis for patients with AT deficiency is indicated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subnormal activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, genotyping is not advisable for PC activities &gt;70% and for PS activities &gt;55% </plain></SENT>
