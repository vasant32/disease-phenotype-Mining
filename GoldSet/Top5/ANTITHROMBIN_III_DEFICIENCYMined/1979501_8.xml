<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This condition is associated with a high incidence of thromboembolic disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous investigations have shown that the ATIII genes in the majority of cases are grossly intact, but the precise underlying molecular defects remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the molecular basis of a type 1 ATIII deficiency in an Italian kindred by enzymatic amplification of the ATIII gene sequences in affected family members and direct sequencing of the amplified genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A novel mutation, the deletion of a single T in the second position of codon 119, was identified in each of the affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The resulting frameshift leads to a premature termination in codon 126, effectively resulting in a null allele </plain></SENT>
