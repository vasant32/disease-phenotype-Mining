<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The abnormal molecule, called AT III 'Vicenza', was characterized by two-dimensional crossed immunoelectrophoresis either in the absence or presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern was found in plasma, but abnormality was evident in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A similar abnormality was found in plasma artificially clotted with thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role of thrombin in inducing the immunoelectrophoretic abnormality of AT III 'Vicenza' is discussed </plain></SENT>
