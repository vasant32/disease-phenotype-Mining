<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EXCA was performed with 10 parts citrated plasma of different contents of fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One part tissue factor, 250 mmol/l CaCl(2), generating about 1 IU/ml thrombin within 1 min (37 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 0-30 min 2.5 mol/l arginine (pH 8.6) Generated thrombin was detected by addition of CHG-Ala-Arg-pNA and measurement of triangle upA/t </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The EXCA is dependent on factors 10% of the factor VII norm in the sample achieves 70-80% of the thrombin generation norm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EXCA is not dependent on factors VIII, IX, XI and XII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even in antithrombin III-deficient plasma, a phase of thrombin inhibition appears after the thrombin peak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Supplemented purified fibrinogen resulted in decreased thrombin generation in the important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen seems to act as antithrombin I; thrombin might be entrapped in the nascent fibrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The EXCA is suitable to diagnose the level of extrinsic factors in patient plasma </plain></SENT>
