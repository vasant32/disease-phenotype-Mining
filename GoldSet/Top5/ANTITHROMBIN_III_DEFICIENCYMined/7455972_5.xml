<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated two thrombophilic families with the "classical" type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, i.e., with a low antithrombin III level measured both by immunochemical and functional methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We obtained different antithrombin III patterns in the plasma of the affected members of the two families with the modified two dimensional immunoelectrophoresis method (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one family, the electrophoretic mobility of the antithrombin III is identical with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the other, the antithrombin III displayed a decreased electrophoretic mobility in the heparinized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relatively low affinity of this antithrombin III to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> could be directly proved by the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> affinity chromatography, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These two different antithrombin III patterns were observed by other investigators at different families as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our simultaneous observations of these two families we propose a classification of the inherited congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiencies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
