<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> circumstances exercise prevents <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, there are cases in the literature that indicate a connection between exercise and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the average population, hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> is a major cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, nothing is known about the prevalence of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in elite athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because high-performance sports are known to carry an increased risk of thrombogenesis, measures to avoid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> must be initiated in cases of known hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was checked for in 173 elite athletes, members of the German national team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, and the APC ratio, followed by a molecular genetic analysis, were measured, and molecular analysis of factor II G20210A mutation was used to detect the presence of an antithrombin III-, protein C- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S-deficiency</z:e>, as well as factor V Leiden (factor V 506Arg to Gln) and factor II G20210A mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No definite antithrombin III-, protein C- or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S-deficiency</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 12 cases, an APC resistance caused by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> (11 heterozygous; 1 homozygous) was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 10 cases, a heterozygous factor II G20210A was observed; a combination of both mutations was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For factor V Leiden, this corresponds to a prevalence of 6.9% (CI 95% 3.6-11.8%) in our group, similar to prevalence rates in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the observed prevalence of 5.8% (CI 95% 2.8-10.4%) of factor II G20210A is nearly within the range as reported by several authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based on the observed prevalence of APC resistance and factor II G20210A mutation in our group of athletes, along with consideration of additional circumstantial risks, screening tests for elite athletes should be considered to allow the undertaking of preventive measures </plain></SENT>
