<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This report documents two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> (BCS) with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> and antithrombin (AT) III deficiency as underlying etiological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Orthotopic liver transplantation was successfully performed in both patients but with different therapeutic intention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the patient with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo>, hepatic transplantation only relieved the symptoms of the predisposing thrombogenic condition; it did not cure the underlying disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic long-term anticoagulation, as well as adjuvant therapy for the causative disease, remained necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in the patient with AT III deficiency, liver transplantation was curative, resulting in complete reconstitution of serum AT III activity with resolution of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, depending on the underlying etiology, liver transplantation for BCS can be considered as palliative, necessitating long-term adjuvant therapy, or as curative, with correction of a metabolic defect </plain></SENT>
