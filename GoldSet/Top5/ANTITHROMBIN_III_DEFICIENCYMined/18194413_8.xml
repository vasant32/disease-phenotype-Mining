<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Objective: To determine the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-thrombotic syndrome</z:e> (PTS) in (i) children with ALL diagnosed with asymptomatic DVT using radiographic testing and (ii) an unselected group of ALL survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional study in two populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group I comprised children in the Prophylactic Antithrombin Replacement in Kids with ALL treated with L-Asparaginase (PARKAA) study diagnosed with DVT by radiographic tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group II consisted of non-selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> survivors &lt;21 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PTS was assessed using a standardized scoring sheet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Group I: 13 PARKAA patients (median age 12 years) were assessed, and 7 had PTS (54%; 95% CI, 25-81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had collaterals, three also had increased arm circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group II: 41 patients (median age 13 years) with a history of ALL were enrolled, and 10 had PTS (24%; 95% CI, 11-38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had collaterals; five also had increased arm circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a high incidence of PTS in survivors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> with radiographically diagnosed asymptomatic DVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant proportion of ALL survivors develop PTS, indicating previously undiagnosed DVT </plain></SENT>
