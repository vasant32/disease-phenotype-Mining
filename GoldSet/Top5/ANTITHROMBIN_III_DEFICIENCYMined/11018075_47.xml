<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using targeted gene disruption, we investigated the role of antithrombin in embryogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mating mice heterozygous for antithrombin gene (ATIII) disruption, ATIII(+/-), yielded the expected Mendelian distribution of genotypes until 14.5 gestational days (gd) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, approximately 70% of the ATIII(-/-) embryos at 15.5 gd and 100% at 16.5 gd had died and showed extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001933'>subcutaneous hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of those embryos revealed extensive fibrin(ogen) deposition in the myocardium and liver, but not in the brain or lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no apparent fibrin(ogen) deposition was detected in the extensive hemorrhagic region, suggesting that fibrinogen might be decreased due to consumptive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that antithrombin is essential for embryonic survival and that it plays an important role in regulation of blood coagulation in the myocardium and liver </plain></SENT>
