<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To rapidly start systemic anticoagulation there are few alternatives to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>; those that may be used are often less effective and are impractical substitutes for various reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the cases of seven patients in whom <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was begun with ancrod instead of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> for one or more of the following reasons: (1) failure to achieve systemic anticoagulation in response to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>), (2) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-associated complications (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, or both), and (3) combined anticoagulation and improved blood rheology considered to be potentially more beneficial than anticoagulation alone (e.g., massive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the cases reported, ancrod permitted systemic anticoagulation equal to that of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>; this was achieved without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to streptokinase or urokinase, ancrod does not degrade preformed, fully cross-linked thrombin fibrin; consequently hemorrhagic complications are uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ancrod appears to be an appropriate alternative to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and may be preferable to it in certain circumstances </plain></SENT>
