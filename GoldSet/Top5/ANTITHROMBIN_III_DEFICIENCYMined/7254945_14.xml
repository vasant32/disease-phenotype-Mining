<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults received a 75 units/kg bolus of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and levels were assayed at 5, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In comparison with the adult data (mean adult plasma <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> half life (T1/2) = 63.3 min), the newborn infants demonstrated a significantly shorter plasma <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> half life (T1/2 = 35.5 min in group I, 33 to 36 wk gestation; 35.5 min in group II, 29 to 32 wk gestation; and 41.6 min in group III, 25 to 28 wk gestation), as demonstrated by a chromogenic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The newborn groups, had a larger volume of distribution (Vd) of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> which varied inversely with gestational age (Vd =36.6 ml/kg in the adults, 57.8 ml/kg in group I, 73.3 ml/kg in group II, and 81.0 ml/kg in group III babies </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A one-stage clotting assay for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> generated similar results, although infant plasma <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> levels were slightly higher by this assay </plain></SENT>
