<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, it essentielly influences the regulation of haemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the aetiology of AT III decreases, hereditary as well as acquired deficiencies can be differentiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the exception of patients with hereditary AT III deficiency it is not possible to define the heavy tendency of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> clearly on a biochemical basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Acquired AT III decreases lead much often to clinical relevant problems than the congenital ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since 1974 we substitute AT III using AT III concentrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of the clinical success was often impeded due to the polypragmatic additional therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Well-founded and strict indications for the substitution of AT III with a therapeutical concentrate are <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> macro- and microthrombosis with decreased AT III levels, e.g. in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic diseases</z:hpo> and in hereditary AT III deficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concerning other clinical pictures with acquired AT III deficiency, a substitution may be indicated very reasonably, however, further studies are necessary to prove this </plain></SENT>
