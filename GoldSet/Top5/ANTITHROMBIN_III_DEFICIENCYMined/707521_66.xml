<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III levels were studied in relation to the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in 48 patients with various degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine of these patients had clinical signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, including four with renal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In eight of these nine patients, antithrombin III concentrations were below 70 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative correlation between the antithrombin III concentration and the urinary protein excreation (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III was found in the urine of 32 of 42 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the renal clearance and the degree of antithrombin III serum deficiency (P less that 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clearance and serum level of albumin closely paralleled these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> is associated with a deficiency of antithrombin III due to urinary excretion of this protein </plain></SENT>
