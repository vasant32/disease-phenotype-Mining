<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A collaborative survey was conducted among Italian <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> centers to gather information about the number and clinical features of patients with inherited thrombotic syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The survey, based on 74 unrelated kindreds, revealed that antithrombin III, protein C and protein S defects are the most frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was more frequent than <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, which was seen in only a minority of cases, most frequently with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011901'>dysfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>About half of the patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> with a similar incidence in antithrombin III, protein S and protein C defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>About half of the symptomatic patients had recurrences and 40% developed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after a triggering factor, most frequently after surgery, during the puerperium, pregnancy, oral contraceptive intake or bed rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>Deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> prevailed and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> was rare in antithrombin III-deficient patients, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was present in about half and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> in about one third of the cases with protein S and protein C defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probability to be free of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> decreases with increasing age and at 35 years can be estimated to be 47% both for men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is, however, a group of patients who are still free of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> despite their older ages </plain></SENT>
