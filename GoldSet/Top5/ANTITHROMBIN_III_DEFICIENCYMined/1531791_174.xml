<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Demographic data, criteria of severity, mortality in ICU, frequency of organ failure, hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters, and laboratory findings were compared in patients with septic shock according to the occurrence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial and sequential levels of ATIII (activity), PC (antigen and activity), PS (total and free), and C4b binding protein (C4bBP) were compared according to the outcome in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Sixty patients with septic shock were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-four entered the group <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>+; 16 entered the group <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Simplified <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> physiologic score (SAPS), frequency of acquired organ failure, blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, and transaminase values were significantly higher in the group <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate reached 77 percent in group <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>+ vs 32 percent in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>- (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, a fatal outcome was associated with higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and transaminase levels, lower PaO2/FIo2 ratio, Vo2, Do2 and O2 extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the group <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>+, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients but two had severe deficiencies in ATIII and PC levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were found between initial ATIII and PC levels, PC and free PS levels, and free PS and C4bBP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Initial ATIII levels had the best prognostic value for prediction of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serial measurements were consistent with a prolonged ATIII and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e> with significantly different levels between survivors and nonsurvivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> is a strong predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and multiple organ failure in patients with septic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Sequential ATIII, PC, and PS measurements were consistent with prolonged consumption or inhibition that might account for a sustained procoagulant state and inhibition of fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The initial ATIII level was the best laboratory predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
