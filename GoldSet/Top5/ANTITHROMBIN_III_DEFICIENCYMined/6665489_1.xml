<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Decrease of AT III level occurred mainly in patients with metallic Bj√∂rk-Shiley prostheses in whom mitral valve replacement had been performed more than 12 months before the investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Particularly low AT III activities were noted in the three patients who developed thromboembolic complications with lethal evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Impaired AT III activity in a patient with prosthetic cardiac valves might be considered as a marker of ongoing in vivo activation of coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such a finding should be a warning and an indication for intensifying the antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
