<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we evaluated the symptoms, clinical and radiologic features and response to thrombolytic therapy in patients who had massive or submassive PTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thrombolytic therapy was administered for a mean period of 3 (1-5) hours to 19 patients with a mean age of 63.7 years who had the diagnosis of PTE based on symptoms which lasted for an average of 72 (2-240) hours and findings of echocardiography, spiral computed tomography (CT) angiography and perfusion scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients to whom <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion and oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment were given after thrombolytic therapy were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> as a complication was noted in six patients after thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients died due to this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control spiral CT angiography was performed to 12 of 15 (80%) patients who were initially diagnosed PTE by spiral CT angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While marked regression was noted in 5 (41.7%) patients in the early phase (second week), in 7 (58.3%) patients in the late phase (sixth month) PTE findings were completely disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median value of pulmonary artery pressure was 65 (45-70) mmHg before and 39.5 (30-45) mmHg after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the genetic factors studied before thrombolytic therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> was found as the most common one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that spiral thorax CT angiography is a very accurate diagnostic tool for the definitive diagnosis and transthoracic echocardiography is very useful for the rapid diagnosis and to decide for thrombolytic therapy, in especially patients who are not hypotensive and have submassive to massive PTE, and support the idea that thrombolytic therapy is life saving after reaching the certain diagnosis </plain></SENT>
