<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: We studied 31 women who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HELLP">HELLP syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011419'>placental abruption</z:hpo>, fetal growth restriction or unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> (study group), matched with 12 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women were tested for: Factor V, Prothrombin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase gene (MTHFR) mutations; for Protein C, S and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>Antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>; for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlation with 24h BP monitoring and uterine Doppler velocimetry indexes at 22-24 weeks' gestation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women with multiple thrombophilic factors had a significant lower birth weight (1568.33+/-146.8 g versus 2546.45+/-438 g), higher 24 h mean diastolic blood pressure at second trimester (76.3+/-12.5 mmHg versus 65.2+/-7.8 mmHg) and higher RI of uterine arteries (0.69+/-0.05 versus 0.50+/-0.15) than women with single thrombophilic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Multiple thrombophilic factors carry a major additional risk for adverse maternal and fetal outcomes and correlate well with placental maladaptation as indicated by uterine Doppler velocimetry and 24h BP monitoring </plain></SENT>
