<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients has spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the arterial system of the vessels of the lower leg, and one developed ileofemoral <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients had abnormally low levels of both antithrombin II and III, whereas two had low levels of antithrombin II only and two had low levels of antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
