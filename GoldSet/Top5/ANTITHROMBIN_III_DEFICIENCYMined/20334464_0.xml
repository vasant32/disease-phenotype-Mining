<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physiologic changes that occur in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040127" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid storm</z:e> may lead to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resistance and inappropriate anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Factors contributing to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resistance include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e>, increased <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> clearance, and increased levels of factor VIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a 30-year-old woman who was hospitalized with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040127" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid storm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She subsequently developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over the next 4 days, the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion rate was titrated to an exaggerated dose of 2100 units/hour (33 units/kg/hr) in order to attain a therapeutic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By hospital day 7, her <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> had resolved; the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion was discontinued, and the patient remained clinically stable with no sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The exact mechanism of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resistance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040127" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid storm</z:e> is unknown; however, data have shown a positive correlation between factor VIII and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This patient had an elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi> level of 32.5 microg/dl, which suggested that an increased factor VIII level was the probable mechanism of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recognition of possible <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resistance in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040127" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid storm</z:e> will allow clinicians to promptly identify appropriate interventions to ensure adequate anticoagulation in this high-risk patient population </plain></SENT>
