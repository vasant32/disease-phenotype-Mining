<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A qualitative defect of antithrombin III (AT III) has been demonstrated over three generations in eight members of an Italian family by the discrepancy between a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> amount of antigen and decreased antithrombin and anti-Xa activity in the presence or in the absence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis in the absence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, two peaks of AT III were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients' plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AT III was purified from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and propositus plasma by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> precipitation followed by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> affinity chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The elution profile of the patient's AT III was abnormal and allowed the separation of two populations of AT III, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first fraction (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT III) contained AT III activity, migrated as a single peak by two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis and by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE), demonstrated a single band with a molecular weight (mol wt) identical to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT III (60,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the last fraction, devoid of AT III activity, migrated as a single abnormal peak by two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis in the absence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE, two bands were observed: one with a mol wt of 60,000 and a second one with a mol wt of 120,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blots clearly demonstrated cross-reactivity of the 120,000 and 60,000 mol wt bands with monospecific antisera to human AT III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reduction of the 120,000 mol wt band converted it to a single 60,000 mol wt band, suggesting the presence of an abnormal dimeric form of AT III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The name AT III Milano is proposed for this new variant </plain></SENT>
