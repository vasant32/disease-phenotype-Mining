<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>Pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> is rare in children, but its incidence is probably underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While its causes are the same as in adults, the role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clotting factor deficiency</z:e> and oral contraceptive agents has recently been stressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: Case n </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1: A 15 year-old girl was immobilized for an ankle strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> of the deep veins of the right leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The condition was confirmed by Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A phlebogram showed a clot floating in the inferior vena cava </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This required the insertion of a clip around it and further thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite immediate intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy, the adolescent died of a massive pulmonary embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The girl had a congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>; she was also taking an oral contraceptive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Case n </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>2: A 15 year-old suffered from left thoracic pain radiating to the shoulder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Perfusion scintiphotography showed evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> of the left inferior lobe and a phlebogram showed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the hypogastric veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This adolescent was 4 months pregnant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A filter was placed inside the inferior vena cava to permit therapeutic interruption of the pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The girl was treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, followed by antivitamin K with an uneventful course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>She suffered from no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clotting factor deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>Pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> remains a severe complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in the femoral and pelvic veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It can occur in adolescents, especially those with a congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clotting factor deficiency</z:e>, those on oral contraceptives or those who are pregnant </plain></SENT>
