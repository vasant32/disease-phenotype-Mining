<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation for the open heart surgery patient undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is achieved with the use of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The industry standard of activated clotting time (ACT) was used to measure the effect of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The commonly acceptable target time of anticoagulation adequacy is 480 seconds or greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some patients, however, exhibit resistance to standard dosing of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and do not reach target anticoagulation time (480 seconds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>Antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> has been previously cited as the cause of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early detection of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resistance (HR) may avoid both the delayed start of CPB and inadequate anticoagulation, if emergency bypass is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An anticoagulation sensitivity test (AST) was developed by adding 12 units of porcine mucosa <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> to the ACT tube (International Technidyne, celite type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Before anticoagulation, 4 mL of blood was drawn from the patient arterial line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following the manufacturer's instructions, 2 mL of blood was added to each tube (ACT-baseline and ACT-AST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three minutes after anticoagulation with 4 mg <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>/kg body weight, a second sample (ACT-CPB) was taken to determine anticoagulation adequacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ACT times of each sample were recorded for 300 procedures occurring during 2004 and were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> resistance occurred in approximately 20% of the patients (n = 61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 54 patients, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resistance was predicted by the ACT-AST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This was determined by the presence of an ACT-AST time and an ACT-CPB that were both &lt; 480 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value was 90%, with a false positive rate of 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> resistance occurs in patients undergoing CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We describe a simple and reliable test to avoid the delays of assessing anticoagulation for CPB (90% positive predictive value) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Depending on program guidelines, patients can be given additional <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or antithrombin III derivatives to aid in anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>An additional ACT must be performed and reach target times before CPB initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Testing of patient blood before the time of incision for sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is a way to avoid a delay that can be critical in the care of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Commercial tests are available, but efficacy data are limited, and they lead to added inventory expense </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This method of titrating a diluted <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> additive, mixed with patient blood in a familiar ACT test, has proven to be an inexpensive and reliable test to predict patient's sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
