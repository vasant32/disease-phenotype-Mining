<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety six patients with PAD were studied, including 45 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo> and 51 with critical limb <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them 65 patients underwent peripheral artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Venous blood samples were obtained and plasma activity level of Protein C (PC), Protein S (PS), Plasminogen (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi>), Antithrombin (AT) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the patients' clinical database the prevalence and clinical relevance was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our PAD patients PC activity is reduced in 18.8%, PS activity is reduced in 16.7%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi> activity was reduced in 15.6% and AT activity was reduced in 24.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of AT activity deficiency was significantly higher in patients with critical limb <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> than patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After revascularization, arterial event free rate of patients with PC or PS activity deficiency and those with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi> deficiency were significantly lower than those without during the mean follow-up period of 26+/-31 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of thromboembolic episodes and leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> rate were significantly worse in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PAD patients with reduced endogenous anti-coagulation proteins show worse prognosis than those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgeons must be aware of it to improve the outcome of arterial revascularization </plain></SENT>
