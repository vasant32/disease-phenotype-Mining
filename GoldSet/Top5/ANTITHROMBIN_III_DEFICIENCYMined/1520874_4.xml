<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This report details the precise mapping of a partially deleted human antithrombin III (AT-III) allele, found in a kindred with an inherited type 1 AT-III deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using truncated AT-III probes generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification from a full-length AT-III cDNA, as well as other genomic probes specific for the 5' upstream region of the AT-III gene, we were able to characterize a partial deletion on an AT-III allele encompassing exons 1 and 2 of the AT-III gene, and a region 5' to the coding sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The absence of the 5' upstream region in the affected AT-III allele was confirmed directly by the PCR amplification of a 1.5-kb polymorphic fragment of genomic DNA samples from family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The precise determination of the 5' breakpoint of the affected allele was made possible by two different approaches: (1) subcloning plus <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> capture PCR, or (2) inverse PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This allowed us to confirm the mapping of the deletion obtained by Southern analysis; to show that the 3' region of the mutant AT-III allele, including exons 3 to 7, was intact; and to sequence approximately 0.7 kb upstream to the breakpoint in the mutant allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, PCR amplification of the region of the breakpoint provided unique products detectable only in affected members of this kindred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint in the partially deleted allele is 480 bp upstream from the 5' boundary of exon 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant homology was found between the 0.7-kb sequence upstream to the breakpoint of the mutant allele and known human sequences </plain></SENT>
