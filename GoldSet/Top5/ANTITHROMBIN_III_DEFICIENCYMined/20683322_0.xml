<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some studies suggest that the mutation is an independent genetic risk factor both for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, but whether the mutation has racial difference or has a general significance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we performed an analysis of the prevalence of the mutation in Chinese southern population; Also, the antithrombin activity levels were evaluated in each investigated individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The studies included 120 patients with DVT, 150 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and 110 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutation was detected using polymerase chain reaction/PvuII restrictive fragment length polymorphism procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin activity assay was done using chromogenic substrate method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that no antithrombin Cambridge II mutation was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups (DVT, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and controls), the incidence was 0/380 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma antithrombin activity was 91.37% +/- 16.15% in the DVT patients and 102.68% +/- 13.10% in the controls; the antithrombin activity was significantly reduced in the DVT group (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In DVT patients, eight cases were identified as primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e>, accounting for an incidence of 6.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found for antithrombin activity between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> group and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that antithrombin Cambridge II mutation has a racial difference, and may not be a valuable risk factor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in Asian population, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> remains a major genetic risk factor for DVT patients in China </plain></SENT>
