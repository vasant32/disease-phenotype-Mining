<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since she had had a history of repeated thrombotic episodes including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in the lower limbs (21 year old) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> developing into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034074" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary infarction</z:e> (41 years old), the patient was treated with anti-coagulant therapy using <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> for 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> was discontinued after admission and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was administered instead at a relatively low dose of 5,000 units daily, resulting in a considerable diminution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately however, it caused a relapse of active <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated not only with a significant increase of the product of fibrinolysis (FDP), LDH and GOT but with a concomitant decrease of the platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hematological examinations concerning coagulation and fibrinolysis remained within a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range except for the serum concentration of antithrombin III (AT III) and its functional property with regard to the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor, which were 8.8 mg/dl and 48%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the findings were consistent with congenital deficiency of AT III, some members of her family were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentration of AT III and its activity in the patient's son and her daughter deteriorated in a similar manner, indicating that this was a definite case of congenital deficiency of AT III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations of 87 cases with congenital AT III deficiency, belonging to 24 families reported in Japan were reviewed </plain></SENT>
