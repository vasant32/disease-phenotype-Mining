<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the case records of 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> mesenteric <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> confirmed on CT imaging or on laparotomy over a 23 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups according to the duration of symptoms: group I with symptoms for up to 3 days duration and group II with symptoms for more than 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 50.55 year, with 15 male and five female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients the diagnosis were confirmed on CT imaging preoperatively except two patients when the diagnosis was established on exploratory laparotomy in the period before 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were six patients in group I and 14 in group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients underwent an operation and one received a non-operative treatment in group I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent laparotomy and 11 received non-operative treatment in group II (P-value 0.01, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were three and one mortality in groups I (n=6) and II (n=14) respectively (P-value 0.061, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most patients received preoperative therapeutic anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients in group II who underwent exploratory laparotomy, neither did receive preoperative anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both patients died in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients were investigated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had one (n=6) or more (n=5) identifiable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e>, these included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> (n=1), both protein C and S deficiency (n=5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> (n=2), factor V Leiden deficiency (n=1) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>None had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, hyperhomocystine <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> and contraceptive pill intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences between thrombophilic and non-thrombophilic patients regarding duration of symptoms, indications for laparotomy and 30 days mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AMVT of rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (&lt;3 days duration) had poor outcome and more patients required laparotomy because of extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> leading to bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis with CT scanning, prompt treatment with anticoagulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, surgical treatment in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> or failure of medical treatment can contain the mortality rate in these patients </plain></SENT>
