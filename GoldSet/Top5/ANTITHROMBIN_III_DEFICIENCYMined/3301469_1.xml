<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human plasma contains two distinct <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> dependent thrombin inhibitors; antithrombin III (ATIII) and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II (HCII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter is also known as antithrombin BM, because of its moderate binding affinity to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protein is distinct from ATIII by immunological and functional criteria as well as by its amino acid sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HCII selectively inhibits thrombin by forming a 1:1 molar complex with the protease and has no activity towards other coagulation serine proteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dermatan <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi>, specifically activates HCII and increases its thrombin neutralizing activity by over a thousand fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dermatan <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> does not catalyze the activity of ATIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human fibroblasts have been shown to accelerate the neutralization of thrombin by HCII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cells can synthesize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> containing dermatan <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Current evidence would thus suggest that extravascular tissues are the major sites of action of HCII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The specificity of dermatan <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> for HCII has allowed the development of functional assays for this protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reduced levels have been observed in patients with significant hepatocellular dysfunction and in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two families have been reported with hereditary HCII deficiency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> (both venous and arterial) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although these observations suggest a role for HCII in the modulation of hemostatic system, further studies are required to define the importance of HCII deficiency as a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
