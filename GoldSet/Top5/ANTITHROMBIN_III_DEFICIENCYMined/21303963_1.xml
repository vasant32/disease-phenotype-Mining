<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> (ARF) undergoing intermittent veno-venous hemofiltration (IVVH) are often at high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No conventional <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> can adequately achieve this task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Argatroban, a synthetic direct thrombin inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of hemodialysis patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> and particularly for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> II patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the anticoagulating effect of argatroban in patients with a high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and one ARF patients at high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> were treated with predilution IVVH, assigned to a nonheparin group (n = 44) and an argatroban group (n = 57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Venous blood was collected to monitor the change of coagulant parameters pre- and post-IVVH in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) value was monitored in the argatroban group at different sites and time points to adjust the dosage during IVVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients in the argatroban group completed treatment successfully, whereas in the nonheparin group, clotting of the extracorporeal circuit occurred in 16.9% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, D-dimer increased slightly and platelet counts decreased post-hemofiltration in the nonheparin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No change was found in platelet counts and coagulant parameters in the argatroban group pre- and post-hemofiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Argatroban prolonged the APTT by 50% at the venous site after the initial bolus and the maintenance infusion at 2 and 4 h during the treatment with no change at the arterial site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episodes and serious side effects were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients with a high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, argatroban is an effective and safe <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> for IVVH </plain></SENT>
