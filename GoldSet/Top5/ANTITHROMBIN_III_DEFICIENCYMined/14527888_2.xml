<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess prevalence of prothrombotic disorders in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with MVT were screened for protein C, protein S, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiencies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A prothrombotic disorder was detected in 9 (81.8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factor V Leiden, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase TT677, and prothrombin G20210A mutations were found in 2 (18.2%), 2 (18.2%), and 5 patients (45.4%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protein S, protein C, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiencies</z:hpo> were present in 1, 1, and 2 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients (36.3%) had combined defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, prothrombotic disorders may have a causative role in the pathogenesis of MVT, and these patients must be screened for these disorders </plain></SENT>
