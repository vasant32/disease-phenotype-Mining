<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human brain thromboplastin progressively loses procoagulant activity when incubated in the presence of defibrinated plasma and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3312">CaCl2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibition is maximal at a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3312">CaCl2</z:chebi> concentration of 1.5 mM during incubation and involves the calcium dependent binding of a plasma component(s) to the TP-FVII complex, preventing the activation of FX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chelation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi> using EDTA releases active TP and FVII from the inhibited complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No inhibition occurs during incubation of TP with Al (OH)3 adsorbed plasma and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi> unless a Factor VII concentrate (or purified FVII and FX) is also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incubation of TP with antithrombin III-deficient plasma and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi> also leads to inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, purified AT III cannot substitute for adsorbed plasma in producing TP inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data are consistent with the presence in plasma of a potent AT III independent inhibitor of TP-mediated blood coagulation </plain></SENT>
