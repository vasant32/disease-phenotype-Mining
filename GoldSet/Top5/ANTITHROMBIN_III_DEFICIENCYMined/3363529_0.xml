<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A quantitative and qualitative deficiency of antithrombin III (ATIII) was found in four members of a Spanish family with thrombotic tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected members, levels of ATIII antigen and activity (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity) were reduced to 50% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) was performed in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, an abnormal slow-moving peak was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Crossed immunoelectrofocusing (CIEF) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and affected individuals showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ATIII migrated between pH 4.9-5.3 while the ATIII under study was asymmetrically distributed between two pH ranges: 4.9-5.3 and 4.6-4.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Affinity adsorption of affected members' plasma to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">sepharose</z:chebi> beads revealed one population of ATIII in the supernatant corresponding to the abnormal ATIII, devoid of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity and showing a peak between pH range: 4.6-4.8 in CIEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data supports the view that a quantitative-qualitative deficiency was present in the heterozygous state in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the affected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal ATIII were present in plasma of the affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This abnormal ATIII was characterized by a lack of affinity for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This familial ATIII deficiency was named ATIII Barcelona </plain></SENT>
