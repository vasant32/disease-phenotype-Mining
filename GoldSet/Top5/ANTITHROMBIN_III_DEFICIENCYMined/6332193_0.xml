<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the simulated result of (4) anticoagulation effect of synthesized arginine derivative No. 805 (MD-805) did not correspond to the results of in vitro assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a new series simulation of MD-805 was done, supposing that MD-805 had an inhibitory activity not only on coagulation factor IIa but also VIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The new simulation pattern closely resembled the results of in vitro assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From these facts, it was theoretically indicated that MD-805 also has an inhibitory activity on VIIa </plain></SENT>
