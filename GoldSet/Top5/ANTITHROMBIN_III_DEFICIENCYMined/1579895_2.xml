<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic therapy is therefore recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reported clinical experience of such prophylaxis is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some authors have recommended the use of AT III concentrate in addition to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in the management of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report successful management with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> alone during pregnancy and the postpartum period in two patients with AT III deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both patients had experienced VTE during a prior pregnancy; one also experienced VTE during the reported pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both patients were therefore at particularly high risk of further VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the good results in these two patients, and a review of previously reported cases, we propose that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> alone, in a dose to maintain the APTT in a therapeutic range, provides adequate prophylaxis and treatment for VTE during pregnancy and delivery in many AT III deficient subjects </plain></SENT>
