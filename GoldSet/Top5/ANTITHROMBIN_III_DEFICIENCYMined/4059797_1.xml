<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three subjects with low levels of the protein were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the prevalence of ATIII deficiency was of 0.43%, corresponding to a prevalence of 0.03% in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of family studies and of clinical and laboratory investigations, inherited ATIII deficiency was excluded and reduced levels of the inhibitor were attributed to an impaired liver function, despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood coagulation tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this study inherited ATIII deficiency cases were not found; however, acquired ATIII deficiency associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clotting tests might represent a rare but definite risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
