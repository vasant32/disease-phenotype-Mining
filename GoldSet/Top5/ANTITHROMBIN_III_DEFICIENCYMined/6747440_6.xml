<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Investigations of a family predisposed to recurrent venous thromboses disclosed a hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reactive antithrombin III concentration in plasma was reduced approximately 50%, and the antigen concentration of the inhibitor was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III from two members of this family was purified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulfate</z:chebi> precipitation, affinity chromatography on <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi>, and ion-exchange chromatography on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi>-Sephadex A-50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">Sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and crossed immunoelectrophoresis showed that only approximately half of the purified antithrombin III was capable of forming a complex with thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This corroborated the finding that approximately twice as much purified antithrombin III from these patients compared with antithrombin III from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> humans was needed for titration of a given amount of thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nonreactive as well as the reactive population of antithrombin III bound <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> with the same affinity as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was shown by crossed immunoelectrophoresis using <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in the first dimension, by the elution pattern during salt gradient elution of antithrombin III from <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi>, and by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> enhancement of intrinsic fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kinetic studies in the absence and in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> indicated that the fraction of antithrombin III that could inactivate thrombin was functionally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The affected family members appeared to be heterozygotes with two autosomal codominant alleles that encode a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and an abnormal antithrombin III protein, respectively </plain></SENT>
