<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only AT-III molecules with a low <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> affinity were detected in her plasma and these pathological AT-III molecules could not increase the rate of the thrombin-inactivation at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathological AT-III molecules were present in the blood of her father and one of her sisters, but only in a 50% quantity, the other half of the AT-III molecules proved to be functionally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mother of the proposita had deceased earlier, thus she could not be investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the authors suggest a heterozygous state for her as well, because this assumption can explain the homozygous (or double heterozygous) state of the proposita </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In accordance with the convention, this abnormality was designated as AT-III Budapest 4, and the exact biochemical and genetic background of the disorders can be clarified only by further investigations </plain></SENT>
