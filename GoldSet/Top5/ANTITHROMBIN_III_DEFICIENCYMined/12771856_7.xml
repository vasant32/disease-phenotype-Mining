<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: In Japan, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (APTE) is still rare, but the number of patients with APTE has been steadily increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important for early diagnosis and early management of APTE to recognize epidemiological characteristics of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the epidemiological characteristics of 252 patients with APTE who were admitted to our institutions between 1975 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APTE was more prevalent in women that in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was observed the most in the age group between 50s to 70s, especially in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many patients had prolonged immobilization, recent major operation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, as risk factors for venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-eight patients developed APTE in hospital; 60 patients were in Department of Internal Medicine, 28 in General Surgery, 15 in Orthopedics, 15 in Obstetrics and Gynecology, and 20 in other services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 58 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, 43% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in digestive organs, 21% in gynecological, and 17% in urological </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 61 patients who were examined for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, 13 patients had inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, 4 protein S deficiency, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>) 11 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> which indicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five out of the above 61 patients (8%) had no obvious risk factors including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings in our patients were almost the same as those in Western patients, except for some points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results might be useful to establish a preventive approach for APTE in Japan </plain></SENT>
