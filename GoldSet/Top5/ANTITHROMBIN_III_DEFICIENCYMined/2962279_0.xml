<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As prophylactic treatment it has been recommended that plasma levels of AT III be normalized by use of AT III concentrates, in addition to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>- We report on the prophylactic treatment of three sisters (age 21, 25, and 32 years) with congenital AT III deficiency (38-53%, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 80-120%) and reduced inducible fibrinolytic activity (1.2, 5.8, 1.2%, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> greater than 8.5%), who had already had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy prophylactic measures were taken individually, depending on the plasma level of beta thromboglobulin (BTG) determined every 2-3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two patients prophylaxis with s.c. <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (2 X 7500 IU/d) was started at the time of the first increase of BTG (around 10th week of gestation), leading to normalization of BTG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When BTG was again elevated, the dose of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was increased stepwise to 2 x 15,000 IU/d; in this way functional AT III levels remained in the range of 28-50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, these two patients received only <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> throughout pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in the third patient BTG levels could not be normalized by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> alone (60-130 ng/ml, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> less than 43 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Injections of AT III concentrate (1000 IU) led to reduction of BTG within 2 hours (60----42,220----61 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, AT III was given from the 25th week of gestation in increasing amounts up to 5000 IU/week (funct </plain></SENT>
