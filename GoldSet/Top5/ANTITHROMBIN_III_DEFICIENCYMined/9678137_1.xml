<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 2674 women were recruited to participate in a multicenter oral contraceptive (OC) study on hemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At baseline, protein S activity less than 60% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values was found in two volunteers (0.75 per 1000) and the antithrombin III activity was less than 60% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values in three volunteers (1.1 per 1000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> measurements were confirmed by a second assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, of the 28 women presenting with protein C levels less than 60% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values, only six were confirmed (2.3 per 1000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, one was also protein S-deficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven women could not be studied twice and 15 were false-low according to their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that routine screening of the hemostatic system may reveal findings suggestive of inhibitor deficiencies in as many as 3.75 per 1000 of apparently healthy candidates for OCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, our data also demonstrate that unselected screening is compromised by a considerable rate of false-positive results and cannot generally be recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, screening of coagulation inhibitors is feasible in women with a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
