<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The significance of acquired antithrombin III (AT III) deficiency must be interpreted in close relation to the underlying disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> liver impairment, the AT III activity is related to a decrease of procoagulatory factors, whereas, in protein loss syndromes such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo>, the AT III indicates an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of oral contraceptives (OC) on AT III levels in young healthy females (n = 30) was determined prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AT III decreases during OC usage could not be related to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> content of the examined oral contraceptives, and there was no parallel decrease of AT III activity and concentration in each type of OC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study, the extent of AT III decrease was determined in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass operations (CPB) receiving different <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> schedules during extracorporeal circulation (n = 49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant influence on the effectiveness of anticoagulation by the observed AT III decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AT III deficiency during CPB was primarily the result of hemodilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the AT III kinetics were significantly influenced by the different protamin dosages and were not affected by the different <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> dosages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correction of diminished AT III levels by substitution of AT III concentrates is beneficial in cases, in which an interruption of an enhanced coagulatory process such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> is necessary or in patients requiring high dosage heparinization as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In those cases the quality of AT III correction correlates to the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the potency of concentrates as well as the individual AT III recovery and half-life must be considered for an appropriate treatment with AT III substitution </plain></SENT>
