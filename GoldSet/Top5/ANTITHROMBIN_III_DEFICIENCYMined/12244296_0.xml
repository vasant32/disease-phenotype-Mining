<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a woman affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> with a bilateral stenosis of the innominate veins, likely of thrombotic nature, diagnosed during central venous catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These events, as that occurred to our patient, are usually caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> inducted by oncologic diseases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, catheters materials and repeated catheterizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the treatment, based on local thrombolysis, systemic heparinization, and surgery to repair venous obstruction, is effective, the prevention of such events is fundamental </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It can be achieved with catheters of particular characteristics and appropriate management techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally it is underlined that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> patients, before catheterization, especially when the objective examination is negative, radiological methodologies and in particular ultrasonography are an important aid to establish the presence or absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in internal jugular, subclavian and innominate veins </plain></SENT>
