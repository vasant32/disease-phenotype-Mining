<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In urine the AT II/III concentrations were significantly correlated to the concentrations of albumin, plasminogen and IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One third of the patients had AT II/III plasma levels below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels showed a significant inverse correlation to the AT II/III and albumin clearance rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarily, the plasminogen concentrations in plasma were decreased in two thirds of the patients, being inversely correlated to the renal plasminogen clearance values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that AT II/III deficiency in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> is an important pathogenetic factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
