<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cranial sinovenous disorders comprise a disparate group of illnesses affecting one or more intracranial venous sinuses and cerebral veins, alone or in combination, due to a variety of causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As medical knowledge advances, fewer and fewer patients have an "idiopathic" diagnosis, with causes clarified in an ever-increasing number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These not only include the long-known puerperal, marantic, infective, and traumatic causes, but in recent years, also a variety of congenital and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398622" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acquired coagulation disorders</z:e>, such as protein S, protein C, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Certain sinuses are preferentially involved with certain causative entities; for example, cavernous and lateral sinuses are more frequently occluded in relation to infectious processes, either directly or as a parameningeal focus, whereas the superior sagittal sinus is most often occluded by trauma, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The optimal treatment of sinovenous occlusion depends on establishing the cause with alacrity, because delays in diagnosis may lead to life-threatening hyperpyrexia, elevations in intracranial pressure, venous infarctions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, because up to a third of patients with nonseptic occlusions may survive untreated, with few residua, controversy persists regarding optimal management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There has been a dearth of randomized, prospective treatment trials in this group of disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The little data that exist suggest that rapid control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> prophylaxis, and anticoagulation must be achieved early so as to prevent progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and intracranial venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In recent years, direct retrograde venous thrombolysis has become increasingly available, and has produced such remarkable results that it is likely soon to become the primary treatment of choice for the nontraumatic or nontumoral occlusions </plain></SENT>
