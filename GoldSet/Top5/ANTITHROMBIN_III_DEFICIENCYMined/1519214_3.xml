<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>F1 + 2 and TAT complexes were measured using an ELISA and FPA levels were measured by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty subjects (48%) were classified as antithrombin III deficient and 33 (52%) as antithrombin III non-deficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean level of F1 + 2 was significantly higher in the deficient adults (0.87 +/- 0.26) compared to both the non-deficient adults (0.70 +/- 0.21) (p = 0.03) and the deficient adults receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (0.16 +/- 0.01) (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The differences in the mean values of TAT complexes and FPA between deficient and non-deficient individuals were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that untreated antithrombin III deficient subjects generate more thrombin than their non-deficient family members and that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> inhibits this thrombin formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this cross-sectional study, it is not possible to correlate the levels of the surrogate makers with future clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
