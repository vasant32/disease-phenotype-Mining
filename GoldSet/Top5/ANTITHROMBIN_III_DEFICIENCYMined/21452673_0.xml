<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pregnant women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, especially those with antithrombin (AT) deficiency, are at high risk of both kinds of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We presented a pregnant women with congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> in the first pregnancy, whose mother had had four times pregnancy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the regular laboratory monitoring of hemostatic parameters and gynaecology surveillance including the follow-up of placental vascular flow, the whole pregnancy proceeded without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prophylactic therapy with low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was introduced from the 20th week of gestation and one dose of substitution therapy with antithrombin concentrate was administrated before delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy and labour were terminated without complications at the 37th week of gestation, resulting in the delivery of a healthy male newborn of 3.6 kg body weight, 52 cm long, and with the Apgar scores of 9/10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A timely made diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, accompanied with regular obstetrics check-ups and follow-ups of hemostatic parameters during pregnancy, as well as the use of adequate prophylactic and substitution therapy, are the successful tools for the prevention of possible maternal complications and pregnancy itself in our patient with congenital AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
