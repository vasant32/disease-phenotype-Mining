<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: According to the data from the North American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study (NAPRTCS), vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> accounts for 11.6% of graft losses in pediatric renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In adults, inherited and acquired thrombophilic risk factors, e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>, have been associated with early graft loss and increased rejection episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on the impact of these factors on the outcome of children after renal transplantation are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS/PATIENTS: Sixty-six pediatric patients awaiting renal transplantation (mean age 10.1 yr) were screened for inherited and acquired risk factors for hypercoagulable disorders (protein C, S, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, factor V Leiden, prothrombin, and MTHFR mutation) in order to intensify anticoagulation in those with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>: intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was administered with a partial prothrombin time (PTT) prolongation of 50 s for 14 days and switched to low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> for another 8 wk before aspirin was introduced for the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients without hypercoagulable risk factors were treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> without PTT prolongation for 14 days and switched to aspirin immediately afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results on graft survival, incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rejection episodes, and long-term renal graft function were analyzed between recipients with and without hypercoagulable risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thrombophilic risk factors were identified in 27.3% of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One serious <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complication led to a second surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rejection episodes was not increased in patients with and without thrombotic risk factors after 90 days (16.7 vs. 25%), 1 yr (22.2 vs. 33.3%), and 3 yr (38.9 vs. 41.7%) of follow-up, respectively (p = n.s.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 3 yr the kidney function was comparable in both groups, with 63.1 in recipients with and 69.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in recipients without hypercoagulable risk (p = n.s.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At latest follow-up, three graft losses were found not to be attributed to thrombotic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Children with thrombophilic risk factors were identified and treated with an intensified anticoagulation regimen after renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An increased risk for graft failure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rejection episodes, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> for pediatric renal transplant recipients with hypercoagulable status was not found </plain></SENT>
