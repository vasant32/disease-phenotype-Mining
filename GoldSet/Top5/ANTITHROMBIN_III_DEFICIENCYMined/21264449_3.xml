<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is activated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> such as <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e> that is mainly associated with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>So far, more than 200 different mutations in the antithrombin gene (SERPINC1) have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to characterise the molecular background in a large cohort of patients with AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis was performed by direct sequencing of SERPINC1 in 272 AT-deficient patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Large deletions were identified by multiplex PCR coupled with liquid chromatography or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To predict the effect of SERPINC1 sequence variations on the pathogenesis of AT deficiency, in silico assessments, multiple sequence alignment, and molecular graphic imaging were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mutation profile consisted of 59% missense, 10% nonsense, 8% splice site mutations, 15% small deletions/insertions/duplications, and 8% large deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Altogether 87 different mutations, including 42 novel mutations (22 missense and 20 null mutations), were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the novel missense mutations, nine are suspected to impair the conformational changes that are needed for AT activation, two to affect the central reactive loop or the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding site, and six to impair the structural integrity of the molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> background of AT deficiency, 10 AT variants occurred in multiple index patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Characterisation of the SERPINC1 mutation profile in large cohorts of patients may help to further elucidate the pathogenesis of AT deficiency and to establish genotype-phenotype associations </plain></SENT>
