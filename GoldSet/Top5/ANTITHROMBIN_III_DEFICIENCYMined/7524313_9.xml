<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is used to prevent and/or treat thrombotic complications in these children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of FFP on plasma concentrations of ATIII and biochemical markers of activation of coagulation has never been tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, FFP (20 ml/kg) was administered to eight children with ALL receiving ASP in the consolidation phase of their treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma samples were drawn pre-infusion, and following infusion at 1, 24, and 48 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior to the FFP infusions, plasma concentrations of prothrombin, fibrinogen, alpha 2-macroglobulin, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II, protein C, and protein S were similar to levels in healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only plasma concentrations of ATIII were significantly decreased (0.55 U/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following FFP infusions, there was no statistical or clinically important increase in plasma concentrations of any coagulation protein at any time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pre-infusion plasma concentrations of markers of endogenous thrombin generation (thrombin-antithrombin III complexes (TAT)) and activation of the fibrinolytic system in response to activation of the coagulation system (D-dimer levels) were significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, FFP had no statistical or clinically important effect on concentrations of these markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that FFP administration for the prevention and treatment of acquired ATIII deficiency secondary to ASP has no demonstrable benefit on plasma levels of coagulation proteins and is unlikely to be of clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
