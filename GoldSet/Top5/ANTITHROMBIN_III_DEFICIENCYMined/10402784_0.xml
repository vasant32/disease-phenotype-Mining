<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In our institute, 1 ml of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is administered to the patients undergoing CABG before dissection and mobilization of the internal thoracic arteries (ITAs) and/or right gastroepiploic artery (GEA) to prevent possible <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or coagulation tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two patients with AT III deficiency underwent CABG and one of them died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to know whether ACT check before and after administration of 1 ml of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is useful as a screening test of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> including AT III deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred patients (84 males and 16 females) undergoing CABG were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age ranged from 41 to 79 years (mean 64.8 +/- 8.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One ml of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was administered to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients before ITAs and/or GEA were dissected and mobilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ACT was doubly checked before (control ACT: c-ACT) and after (heparinized ACT: h-ACT) administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ACT extension was defined as follows: ACT extension = (c-ACT)-(h-ACT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean c-ACT was 124 +/- 12 sec., h-ACT 188 +/- 26 sec. and ACT extension 64 +/- 24 sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were only 3 cases which ACT extension were less than 30 sec.: two of them were combined with AT III deficiency and the other was due to insufficient administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, examination of ACT after 1 ml administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is new, simple and convenient screening method for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> including AT III deficiency during CABG </plain></SENT>
