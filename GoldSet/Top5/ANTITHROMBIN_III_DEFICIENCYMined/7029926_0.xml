<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In three different disease entities associated with acquired antithrombin III (AT III) deficiency some of the pathogenetic mechanisms were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> (23 patients) the AT III level was closely correlated to the activity of hepatocellular synthesized clotting factors, indicating decreased AT III synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In glomerular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> (20 patients not on steroid therapy) the plasma level of AT III correlated inversely to the renal AT III clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">septicaemia</z:e> (33 patients) the ratio between AT III antigen (radial immunodiffusion) and functional AT III (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor assay using a chromogenic substrate) demonstrated an excess of AT III antigen probably due to inactive AT III-enzyme complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore consumption of AT III appears to be an important cause of AT III deficiency in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">septicaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse correlation between this ratio and the plasma AT III activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is well documented that congenital AT III deficiency predisposes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) and sometimes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar clinical relevance may be assumed for an acquired AT III deficiency, though so far a relationship between AT III deficiency and DVT has been only established in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
