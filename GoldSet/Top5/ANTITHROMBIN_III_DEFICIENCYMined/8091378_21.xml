<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a retrospective collaborative controlled cohort-study was carried out in 8 coagulation laboratories and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> units in Austria, Germany and Switzerland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in 48 females heterozygous for hereditary type I deficiency of antithrombin III (n = 15), protein C (n = 16) or protein S (n = 17), who had taken OC at least once in their life were compared with that of 48 deficient women, who had never taken OC (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of the deficiency state was made in the participating centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and duration of OC intake and the date and site of thrombotic events were obtained from a questionnaire filled in by the patient or a physician during a visit at a participating center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observation period in the OC patients was started with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of OC intake and was terminated when a thromboembolic event had occurred or when OC medication were discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the patients without OC, the observation period began at an age matched to that of the OC patient and ended when a thromboembolic event had occurred or was continued as long as the corresponding OC patient was on treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In AT III-deficient females the probability for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was significantly higher for patients taking OC compared to the non-OC-patients (Wilcoxon test p = 0.004, Log Rank test p = 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
