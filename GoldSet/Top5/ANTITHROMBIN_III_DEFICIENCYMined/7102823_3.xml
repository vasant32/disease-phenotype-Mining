<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Presented herein is a case report of a 20-year-old woman with a past history of oral contraceptive use who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> of her illness was abrupt and stormy, simulating fulminant <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo> or toxic hepatic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She died within six months of her initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the patient discontinued the use of oral contraceptives two years prior to the initial presentation of the disease, the morphologic features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and hepatic damage were indicative of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, ongoing process of longer than six months' duration, thus raising the possibility of a cause-effect relationship between the "pills" and thrombotic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of interest was the finding of persistently depressed antithrombin III levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While a relationship between oral contraceptive usage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> is strongly suggested in this case, prospective studies are needed to substantiate this view </plain></SENT>
