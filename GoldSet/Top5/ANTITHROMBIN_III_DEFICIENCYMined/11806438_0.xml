<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 63-year-old, 96 Kg female with a posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was treated with intravenous (IV) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion for 7 days before myocardial revascularization surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient required 1200 IU/Kg of beef lung <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> to extend the activated clotting time (ACT) in order to initiate CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 1562 IU/Kg of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was administered throughout the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This acquired <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resistance was attributed to an antithrombin (AT III) deficiency, and was treated with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to restore adequate anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's heparinized ACTs ranged between 368 seconds and 387 seconds before FFP administration as opposed to 626 seconds to 1329 seconds after treatment with FFP and additional <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> once on CBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient experienced an uneventful postoperative course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Future treatment with AT III concentrate rather than FFP may reduce <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> requirements that will, in turn, reduce protamine reversal dose, postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> attributable to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> rebound, and its associated complications </plain></SENT>
