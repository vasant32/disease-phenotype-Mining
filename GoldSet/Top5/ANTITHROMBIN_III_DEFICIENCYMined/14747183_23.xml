<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This case-control study was conducted in an academic tertiary care hospital and compared 45 women with a history of four or more failed IVF cycles (group A) with 44 apparently healthy women matched for age and ethnic origin (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were tested for inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo>: mutations of prothrombin, factor V Leiden and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR), and protein C, protein S and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiencies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Excluding homozygotic MTHFR, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in group A, was 26.7% compared with 9.1% in group B (P = 0.003; odds ratio 2.9; 95% confidence interval 1.02-8.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in women with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> in group A was 42.9% (9/21), compared with 18.2% in group B (P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> may play a role in the aetiology of repeated IVF failures, particularly in the subgroup with unexplained fertility </plain></SENT>
