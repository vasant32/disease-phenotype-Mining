<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hind limb <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> was evident, extremities were hypothermic, and femoral pulses were not palpable </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alteplase is a fibrin-specific activator of plasminogen and may be safer and more efficacious than conventional streptokinase treatment </plain></SENT>
