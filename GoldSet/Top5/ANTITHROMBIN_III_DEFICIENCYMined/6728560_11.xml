<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study 84 premature infants [26 healthy prematures and 58 neonates with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome (IRDS)] were studied daily during the first week of life, to investigate the possible significance of hemostatic abnormalities in IRDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In neonates with IRDS, coagulation factors II and X, antithrombin III (AT-III), plasminogen, and alpha 2-antiplasmin were significantly lower than control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recovery of the initially low AT-III levels was delayed relative to the other coagulation parameters measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An AT-III less than or equal to 0.15 U/ml was present within the first 6 h of life in eight patients who developed IRDS, seven of whom died within 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autopsy of these neonates showed widespread <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in vital organs consistent with intravascular coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that very low levels of AT-III are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> in neonates with IRDS and suggest that a deficiency of AT-III is predictive of a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
