<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These changes were proved to reflect the course of intravascular hemocoagulation whose degree of manifestation is related directly to the extent of specific lesions in the lungs and intoxication phenomena </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is pathogenetically proved to use antithrombin III concentrate preparations with anti- and dysaggregatory properties, fibronectin preparations, trasylol or its analogs during complex preoperative preparation of patients </plain></SENT>
