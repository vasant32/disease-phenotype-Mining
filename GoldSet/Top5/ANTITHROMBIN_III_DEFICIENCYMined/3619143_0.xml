<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AT III is a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> which inhibits <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> serine proteases, except factor, VIIa, generated during the coagulation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proteases are inactivated by formation of an equimolecular complex and this reaction is greatly enhanced in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A similar catalytic process could occur in vivo, involving <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-like substances present on the surface of the surface of the endothelial cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The physiological importance of AT III is clearly demonstrated by the high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> in patients with congenital AT III d√©fficiency </plain></SENT>
