<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides treatment of the underlying diseases therapy of consumption <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> was performed with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and nowadays with substitution of coagulation factors, especially antithrombin III concentrate, alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed administration of AT III concentrates only, without additional <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment in children with proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">septicaemia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm infants</z:e> n = 21, children beyond the newborn period n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III, platelet count, fibrinogen, PT, aPTT and TT were assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These coagulation parameters turned to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 48 hours after normalisation of the antithrombin III plasma level-AT III increased to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values within 24 hours after the initial substitution in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lethal outcome was not observed after sole administration of AT III as well as no other side effects have been seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, these data indicate that consumption <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> in childhood can be managed successfully with early substitution of AT III concentrate </plain></SENT>
