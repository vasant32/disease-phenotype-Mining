<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We were able to carry out a study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) with the cooperation of clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>I herein describe a part of the study that I have conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Japanese patients with DVT were investigated regarding their incidences of antithrombin III (AT-III), protein C (PC), and protein S (PS) deficiencies, and the results were compared with those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that the Japanese population has a high frequency of PC and PS deficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we recommend that PS activity should be measured for the screening of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> since type II deficiency accounted for approximately 50% of PS deficiency cases in both patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group in Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the reactivity of thrombin to TM by determining the TM-bound thrombin (TMBTh) to total thrombin generation (t-Th) ratio (TMBT ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also examined whether a decreased TMBT ratio is associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TMBT ratio (TMBTh/t-Th) was significantly lower in patients with DVT than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that it is possible to evaluate the reactivity of thrombin to TM by determining the TMBT ratio, and this ratio may be a predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, we have yet to investigate the causal mechanism </plain></SENT>
