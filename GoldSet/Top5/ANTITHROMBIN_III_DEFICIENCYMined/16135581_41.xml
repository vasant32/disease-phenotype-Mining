<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the frequency of pregnancy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> among carriers of the factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation without a personal history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, and to evaluate the impact of maternal and fetal FVL mutation carriage or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> on the risk of adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Women with a singleton pregnancy and no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were recruited at 13 clinical centers before 14 weeks of gestation from April 2000 to August 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each was tested for the FVL mutation, as was the resultant conceptus after delivery or after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e>, when available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (primary outcome), and of other adverse outcomes, was compared between FVL mutation carriers and noncarriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also compared adverse outcomes in a secondary nested carrier-control analysis of FVL mutation and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this secondary analysis, we defined carriers as women having one or more of the following traits: carrier for FVL mutation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, activated protein C resistance, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>-positive, heterozygous for prothrombin G20210A or homozygous for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12071">5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carriers of the FVL mutation alone (with or without activated protein C resistance) were compared with those having one or more other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> and with controls with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormality</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred thirty-four FVL mutation carriers were identified among 4,885 gravidas (2.7%), with both FVL mutation status and pregnancy outcomes available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> occurred among the FVL mutation carriers (0%, 95% confidence interval 0-2.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> occurred (0.08%, 95% confidence interval 0.02-0.21%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> occurring in FVL mutation noncarriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the nested carrier-control analysis (n = 339), no differences in adverse pregnancy outcomes were observed between FVL mutation carriers, carriers of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorders</z:e>, and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Maternal FVL mutation carriage was not associated with increased pregnancy loss, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011419'>placental abruption</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo> births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, fetal FVL mutation carriage was associated with more frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> among African-American (15.0%) and Hispanic (12.5%) women than white women (2.6%, P = .04), adjusted odds ratio 2.4 (95% confidence interval 1.0-5.2, P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among women with no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, maternal heterozygous carriage of the FVL mutation is associated with a low risk of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Neither universal screening for the FVL mutation, nor treatment of low-risk carriers during pregnancy is indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-2 </plain></SENT>
