<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggests that it may be a physiologically important regulator of thrombin activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated and modified a method for clinical laboratory determination of this protein and then utilized the method to analyze HC II activity in various clinical samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low levels were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, consumptive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels were seen with uncomplicated pregnancy, oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, hereditary antithrombin III (AT III) deficiency, and in 31 patients evaluated for a thrombotic tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Except in hereditary AT III deficiency, decreased HC II activity was associated with decreased AT III activity </plain></SENT>
