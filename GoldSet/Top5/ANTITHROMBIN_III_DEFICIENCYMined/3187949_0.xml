<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The AT III CIEF pattern was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with AT III quantitative deficiency, showing a balanced decrease of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the peaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Out of the 8 AT III variants investigated, 6 had an abnormal pattern: the three variants with defective binding to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (AT III Roma, AT III Barcelona, AT III Malm√∂) shared a similar abnormal pattern; three variants with defective binding to serine proteases (AT III Pescara, AT III Milano, AT III Tampere) had a common abnormal pattern clearly different from the first one, whereas the other two variants deficient in the inactivation of the serine proteases (AT III Chicago, AT III Milano 2) showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first type of pathological pattern (type Roma) was characterized by the presence of an abnormal peak overlapping the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> isoforms present at pH 4.8-4.6 and by an additional peak at pH 4.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second type of pattern (type Pescara) showed an additional peak at pH 4.5 and an abnormal quantitative distribution of the isoantithrombins <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> throughout the pH range (5.2-4.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to separate the abnormal AT III fraction from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> one, plasma of a patient with Roma defect and serum of a patient with Pescara defect were passed throughout an <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-ultrogel column.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
