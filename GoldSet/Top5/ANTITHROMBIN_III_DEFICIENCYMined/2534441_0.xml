<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to determine a scheme for the screening of inherited thrombotic disorders, abnormalities considered as predisposing to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> have been reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Owing to the low prevalence of biological alterations, a selection of patients is required: documented venous thromboses, possibly at unusual sites (mesenteric vein, portal, cerebral veins), occurring before the age of 40 in patients with a positive family history of thromboses are relatively frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with skin <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> at the initiation of oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, or with repeated superficial vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or unexplained <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> at a young age might be included for screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tests have also to be selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some abnormalities, such as congenital deficiencies in antithrombin III, protein C and protein S, are recognized risk factors and have to be searched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some others cannot be at present considered as definite risk factors (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0011901'>dysfibrinogenemias</z:hpo> or deficiencies in factor XII), but their detection is easy by routine tests: prothrombin time, fibrinogen assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other abnormalities are recognized risk factors (or not) and need specific uncommon tests (e.g., study of fibrinolysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each time a biological abnormality is found, it is important to verify it is isolated since combined deficiencies have been observed and we should be able to answer the question whether the abnormality is the cause or the consequence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, or a coincidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, in our experience, even in well selected patients, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorder</z:e> is detected in less than 30% of patients, so that new tests are needed to improve our knowledge in this field </plain></SENT>
