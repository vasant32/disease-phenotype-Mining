<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Isolated deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, and plasminogen have been implicated as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is assumed that patients with recurrent, familial, or juvenile <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are very likely to have such a deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the prevalence of isolated deficiencies of these proteins in 277 consecutive outpatients with venographically proved <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, as compared with 138 age-matched and sex-matched controls without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, and calculated the positive predictive value of a history of recurrent, familial, or juvenile venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> for the presence of such a deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence of deficiencies of any of these proteins in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was 8.3 percent (23 of 277 patients) (95 percent confidence interval, 5.4 to 12.4), as compared with 2.2 percent in the controls (3 of 138 subjects) (95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 6.1; P less than 0.05 for the comparison between groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive values for the presence of an isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein deficiency</z:e> in patients with recurrent, familial, or juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, defined as the proportion of patients with the clinical finding who had a deficiency of one or more of the proteins, were 9, 16, and 12 percent, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in most outpatients (91.7 percent) cannot be explained by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>abnormalities of coagulation</z:hpo>-inhibiting and fibrinolytic proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The information obtained from the medical history concerning recurrent or familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> or the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease at a young age is not useful for the identification of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein deficiencies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
