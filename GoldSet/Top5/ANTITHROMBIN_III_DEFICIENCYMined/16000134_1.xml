<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The plasma antithrombin activity was decreased and hardly compensated by concentrated antithrombin preparation due to high consumption rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, successful anticoagulation was achieved by administration of direct thrombin inhibitor, argatroban </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A novel heterozygous mutation in the gene for antithrombin (single nucleotide T insertion at 7916 and 7917, Glu 272 to stop in exon 4) was identified </plain></SENT>
