<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This adverse effect of hepatin has been observed directly with at least 1.5 Iowa units of thrombin per each unit of purified human antithrombin III participating in the reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory capacity was then totally destroyed and some residual thrombin remained in the active form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a lower enzyme/inhibitor ratio inactivation of thrombin in the presence of hepatin was fast and complete, however, a significant decrease of inhibitory capacity below that found in reaction without <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, has been established by measuring the residual antithrombin III activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In defibrinated human plasma at least 2 units of thrombin per each antithrombin III unit were required to demonstrate directly the adverse effect of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> but a fast <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of inhibitory capacity has been also observed after repeated additions of small thrombin portions into plasma heparinized in vitro or in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Portions of enzyme initially added disappeared with great velocity; subsequent portions, however, accumulated building up a high thrombin level not seen in the absence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of residual enzyme was more extensive in plasma containing about 1 heparin unit per ml than <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> at lower concentrations and was particularly noticeable in antithrombin III deficient plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results may have some bearings on the approach to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy in the event when thrombin continuously generates or when a marked deficiency of antithrombin III exists </plain></SENT>
