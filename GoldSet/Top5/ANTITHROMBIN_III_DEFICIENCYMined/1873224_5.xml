<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantitative AT III deficiencies are associated with a high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although this risk is smaller in patients with qualitative AT III deficiencies, the molecular defects characterizing the latter have been the subject of many studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in quantitative AT III deficiencies, only three mutations have been described: Pro 407 to Leu and A1a404 to Thr (both located in the C-terminal part of the AT III molecule) and also a frameshift in exon IIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the asymmetric polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genomic DNA analysis by direct sequencing, we detected two mutations in three unrelated families: (i) a C----T transition in exon IIIa in two families, leading to the replacement of the codon corresponding to Arg 129 by a stop codon, and (ii) in the third family, insertion of an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> in the codon corresponding to Phe 408, a highly conserved serpin amino acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This insertion altered the reading frame and led to the appearance of a premature stop signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three families were heterozygous for their abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show that asymmetric PCR and genomic DNA analysis by direct sequencing permit fast identification of the molecular basis of quantitative AT III deficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that in many cases the absence of AT III gene product probably results from point mutation, as previously observed for another serpin, alpha-1-antitrypsin </plain></SENT>
