<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes how such concentrates have been used in a patient with congenital AT-III deficiency undergoing venous surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 40-year-old woman with AT III deficiency was evaluated for bilateral grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive venous assessment and ascending venography revealed incompetence of the lower leg perforators, a patent deep venous system, and competent greater and lesser saphenous veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Staged subfascial ligations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pasteurized AT III was administered 1 hour before surgery and at 30 hours at a dose calculated to increase AT-III activity to at least 120% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perioperative AT III activity levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and oral <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> were initiated the evening of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An infusion of AT III increased plasma AT III from the baseline activity of 51% to 180%; it was 87% 13 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two measurements of the initial half-life of AT III were 7 and 14 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No perioperative thrombotic complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> healed, and the patient remains symptom free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pasteurized AT III concentrates are now commercially available, easily administered, and provide a useful adjunct to the anticoagulation regimen of patients with AT III deficiency undergoing vascular surgery </plain></SENT>
