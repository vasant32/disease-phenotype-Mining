<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> aortic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, which was managed initially with bilateral femoral thrombectomy and calf fasciotomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the early postoperative period, increasing doses of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> were required to maintain adequate anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hematologic evaluation revealed a deficiency of antithrombin III (AT-III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such a deficiency has been recognized as occurring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo>, most probably due to urinary loss of this serum protein </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment is initiated with fresh frozen plasma and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, with subsequent utilization of oral <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
