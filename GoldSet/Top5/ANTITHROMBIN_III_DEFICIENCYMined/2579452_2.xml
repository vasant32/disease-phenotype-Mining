<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the effect of this drug to that of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and AT III infusions in AT III deficient patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients with AT III congenital deficiency received on three different occasions: (i) an infusion of human AT III concentrate (20 U/kg or 40 U/kg), (ii) an intramuscular injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15447">pentosan</z:chebi> polysulphate (2 mg/kg), (iii) a subcutaneous calcium <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> injection (100 U/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AT III infusion inhibits the excessive thrombin generation (46% of inhibition) observed in the plasma of AT III deficient patients during at least 12 hours, but does not modify the factor Xa formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15447">pentosan</z:chebi> polysulphate has a marked effect on both thrombin (62% of inhibition) and factor Xa generation (57% of inhibition) still present 8 hours after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> injection has the same effect, more prolonged, as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15447">pentosan</z:chebi> polysulphate on thrombin generation but is not so effective on impairing factor Xa generation (27% of inhibition) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The marked effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15447">pentosan</z:chebi> polysulphate on thrombin and factor Xa generation in these patients is due to its AT III independent mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
