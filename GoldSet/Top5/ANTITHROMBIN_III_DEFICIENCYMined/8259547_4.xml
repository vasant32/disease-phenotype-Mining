<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activities of Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI), <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and hirudin were compared in intrinsic (APTT) and extrinsic (PT) activated clotting assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the thrombin inhibitor hirudin, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was 10 fold more potent in the APTT assay than in the PT assay, indicating that inhibition of intrinsic activation is important for the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> as measured in an APTT assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TFPI was most potent in the PT assay and the effect of TFPI was most pronounced in the presence of other <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and hirudin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activities of the two natural <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> antithrombin III (ATIII) and TFPI were compared in a PT assay with very dilute tissue factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this assay system TFPI in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma affected the clotting time more than ATIII in the plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was added ATIII was the major <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, but profound prolongation of the clotting time was only seen when TFPI was also added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an ATIII deficient plasma <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> did not augment the effect of TFPI, showing that the increased effect of TFPI in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is dependent on the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity of ATIII/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of TFPI at <z:hpo ids='HP_0005542'>prolonged clotting times</z:hpo> was also illustrated by the significant effect of blocking TFPI in the plasma from <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus TFPI is a major <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma and the effect of TFPI is especially seen at <z:hpo ids='HP_0005542'>prolonged clotting times</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
