<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 123 consecutive patients were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following parameters were investigated by using commercially available methods: PT, aPTT, TT, Fibrinogen, D-Dimer, Anti thrombin 3 (AT), Protein C (PC), Protein S (PS), activated C protein (APC) resistance, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), FV Leiden (G1691a mutation), Prothrombin G20210A mutation, MTHFR mutation (G677T mutation), anti Prothrombin auto-antibodies (PR) IgG and IgM, anti Beta 2 glycoprotein 1 (B2GP1) auto-antibodies IgG and IgM, anti <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">Cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) auto-antibodies IgG and IgM, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 123 patients considered we observed: two AT deficiency, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiencies</z:e>, one PS deficiency, 60 FV Leiden mutation (six homozygous), 1 Prothrombin gene mutations (heterozygous), 71 MTHFR mutations (15 homozygous) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study of anti <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> auto antibodies showed 10 patients positive for LA, 9 for anti CL antibodies (6IgG and 3IgM), 10 for anti B2GP1 antibody (5 IgG and 5IgM), 3 for anti PR antibody (IgG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty nine patients showed hyper homocysteinemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our study only 19 patients were free of demonstrable <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 51 subjects a single risk factor was identified and in 53 multiple (from 2 to 5) risk factors were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our opinion a Laboratory assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> risk factors after a previous episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is a diagnostic tool of great importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a matter of fact, in our experience, by using a standard analytical panel, it was possible to highlight one or more risk factors in about 85% of the patients considered </plain></SENT>
