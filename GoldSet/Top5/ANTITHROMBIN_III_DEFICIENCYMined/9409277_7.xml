<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess whether certain abnormalities of the sulfated amino acid metabolism are associated with the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> in patients with inherited thrombophilic conditions, the levels of homocyst(e)ine, before or after methionine load, and the presence of the Ala223Val substitution in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12071">5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) were evaluated in 119 subjects with a congenital single thrombophilic condition (type I deficiency of antithrombin n = 10, protein C n = 24, protein S n = 16; activated protein C resistance due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> n = 69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three subjects had experienced at least one documented thrombotic event, while the remaining 56 subjects were still free from any thrombotic symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results show that (1) high homocyst(e)ine levels, either in fasting condition or after methionine load, were not more frequent in subjects with inherited thrombophilic alterations (14.4%) than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (10% by definition) and (2) the frequency of hyperhomocyst(e)inemia was similar in thrombophilic subjects, who already have (14.3%) or have not (14.6%) experienced thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As regards the MTHFR mutation, the homozygous condition was present in 23.2% of the thrombophilic patients versus 17.5% in the control subjects, a nonsignificant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutation was slightly more frequent in those thrombophilic subjects who had suffered a thrombotic episode (25.5%) versus those with no <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (20.8%), with odds ratios of 1.61 (confidence interval (CI) = 0.58-4.52) and 1.24 (CI = 0.42-3.43), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These differences were also nonsignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that in subjects with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo>, a condition of hyperhomocyst(e)inemia "per se" is not a factor increasing the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk enhancement conferred by the MTHFR mutation, if any, seems to be slight or limited, and its significance could be ascertained only in a large multicenter trial </plain></SENT>
