<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, we report the case of a male patient with symptoms of AAE and recurrent deep venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a trigger of AAE in the present patient, we revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, along with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in the history, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although anti-C1-INH titers (type I AAE) were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> initially, we observed a sharp increase in anti-C1-INH titers (suggestive of type II AAE) during follow-up </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> should be considered a provoking factor of AAE and should be carefully sought for in these patients, as the key to successful management of AAE is the effective treatment of the underlying disease </plain></SENT>
