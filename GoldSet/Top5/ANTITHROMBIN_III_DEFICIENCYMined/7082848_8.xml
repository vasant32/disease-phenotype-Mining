<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma antithrombin III (AT-III) levels were 48% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by immunoelectrophoresis and 56% by chromogenic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of four siblings and the father had similar AT-III levels without associated venous thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> chromatography demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> behavior of the patient's AT-III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her purified AT-III could not be distinguished from AT-III purified from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control either by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis or by crossed immunoelectrophoresis, and the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity and the progressive antithrombin activity of both AT-III samples were identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Turnover studies were made in the patient using her own purified AT-III labeled with 131I, (*I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results did not differ significantly from studies made with autologous *I-AT-III in two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Her fractional breakdown rate of 0.54 total plasma AT-III per day compared with 0.45 and 0.52 in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that the patient synthesizes a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT-III molecule at half <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rates </plain></SENT>
