<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have explored the potential of this technique for identifying the underlying mutation in five individuals with a Type I deficiency and one individual with a Type II deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each case correctly spliced transcripts of the correct size were obtained, direct sequencing of which clearly demonstrated the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This method simplifies the detection of mutations in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> and further extends the use of ectopic transcript analysis </plain></SENT>
