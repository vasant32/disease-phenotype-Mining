<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acceleration of the coagulation cascade is known to result in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) and end-organ dysfunction, as manifest by pulmonary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of injury on the endogenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> that inhibit excessive coagulation activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated a group of patients following severe injury and found that procoagulant markers (prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin antithrombin complexes, and D dimers) were significantly elevated for the population as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of circulating endogenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> [antithrombin (AT) and protein C] were relatively unchanged for the total population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, patients with adverse outcomes [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> and adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e>)] had significant reductions in AT and protein C activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreased levels of AT and protein C 8 hours after admission served as independent predictors of both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prospective, randomized studies should be conducted to evaluate the effect of supplementation of these factors after severe injury has occurred </plain></SENT>
