In this study no one of our 85 patients of Serbian origin with young-onset (</= 45 years) dopa-responsive parkinsonism (YOP), previously proved negative for PARK1 and PARK2 mutations, had either spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) or SCA3 mutation. These data do not prove the significance of these two mutations in either sporadic or familial YOP suggestive of Parkinson's disease.
