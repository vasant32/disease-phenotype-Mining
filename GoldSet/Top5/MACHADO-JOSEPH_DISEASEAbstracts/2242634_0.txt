The propositus (case 1) was a 40 year-old man. He had begun to note unsteady walking at age 26. He was found to have cerebellar ataxia and pyramidal signs in addition to minor features such as progressive external ophthalmoplegia, gaze nystagmus, bulging eyes, intention fasciculation-like movements of facial and lingual muscles, and limb dystonia. These findings were categorized into type II form of the disease. One sister (case 3) aged 37 years, and one brother (case 4) aged 44 years of the propositus had also type II form of the disease. His uncle (case 2) had the same cerebellar and extrapyramidal signs accompanied with peripheral nerve signs such as muscle wasting, weakness, hypo-tonus and decreased deep tendon reflexes, and a diagnosis of type III form of the disease was made. In the T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 T, TR 2000 or 3000 msec, TE 120 msec) of the three patients (case 1, 3 and 4), dorsolateral part of the putamen showed decreased signal intensity. Although hypo-intensity of the putamen is often observed in normal elderly people over 50 years old, it is considered to be abnormal when it exists in relatively young people as in this family members.
