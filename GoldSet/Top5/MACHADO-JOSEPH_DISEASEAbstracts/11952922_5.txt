Tandospirone citrate (tandospirone) is an anti-anxiety drug that acts by combining with serotonin receptor (5-hydroxytryptamine-1 A [5-HT1A]). Recently, there have been a few reports of its potential role in the treatment of cerebellar ataxia. We report the first case of a patient with Machado-Joseph disease in which we successfully treated cerebellar ataxia. In addition, his leg pain, insomnia, anorexia, and depression, which are thought to be related to 5-HT1A receptors, were also remarkably alleviated by treatment with tandospirone.
