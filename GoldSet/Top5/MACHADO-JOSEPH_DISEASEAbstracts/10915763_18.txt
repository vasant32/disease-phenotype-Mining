Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by the expansion of a polymorphic (CAG)(n) tract, which is translated into an expanded polyglutamine tract in the ataxin-2 protein. Although repeat length and age at disease onset are inversely related, approximately 50% of the age at onset variance in SCA2 remains unexplained. Other familial factors have been proposed to account for at least part of this remaining variance in the polyglutamine dis-orders. The ability of polyglutamine tracts to interact with each other, as well as the presence of intra-nuclear inclusions in other polyglutamine disorders, led us to hypothesize that other CAG-containing proteins may interact with expanded ataxin-2 and affect the rate of protein accumulation, and thus influence age at onset. To test this hypothesis, we used step-wise multiple linear regression to examine 10 CAG-containing genes for possible influences on SCA2 age at onset. One locus, RAI1, contributed an additional 4.1% of the variance in SCA2 age at onset after accounting for the effect of the SCA2 expanded repeat. This locus was further studied in SCA3/Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), but did not have an effect on SCA3/MJD age at onset. This result implicates RAI1 as a possible contributor to SCA2 neurodegeneration and raises the possibility that other CAG-containing proteins may play a role in the pathogenesis of other polyglutamine disorders.
