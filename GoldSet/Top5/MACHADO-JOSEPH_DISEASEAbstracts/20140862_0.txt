 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of autophagy on the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia 3/Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD). METHODS: HEK293 cells expressing polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-3 were used as cell model for SCA3/MJD. The level of polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-3 was detected after cells were treated with different inhibitors or inducer of autophagy. RESULTS: Inhibition of autophagy increased aggregate formation and cell death in HEK293 cells expressing mutated ataxin-3, and vice versa. CONCLUSION: The data suggested that autophagy is involved in the degradation of mutant ataxin-3, resulting in a decrease in the proportions of aggregate-containing cells and cell death in HEK293 cells expressing polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-3. It is possible that autophagy may be applied as a potential therapeutic approach for SCA3/MJD.
