The reported case had extrapyramidal signs and sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, and it seems to be a genetic disorder separate from the Machado-Joseph disease. Abnormalities of CSF were found, and EMG showed a sensorimotor neuropathy. MRI of the brain demonstrated hypodense lesions in the lentiform nucleus of the left hemisphere.
