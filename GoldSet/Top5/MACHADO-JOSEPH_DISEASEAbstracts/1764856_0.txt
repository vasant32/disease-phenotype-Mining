Dopaminergic neuron controls CNS functions such as meso-limbic, striato-nigral and tubero-infundibular systems. The purpose of the present study is the evaluation of the hypothalamic dopaminergic neuron activity in neuro-degenerative disorders. alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) is synthesized in the arcuate nucleus and lateral part of the hypothalamus, and its secretion is under the inhibitory control of the dopaminergic neuron both in the hypothalamus and pituitary. alpha-MSH-like-immunoreactivity (alpha-MSH-LI) in CSF is thought to be representative to the dopaminergic neuron activity in the hypothalamus. We therefore evaluated CSF levels of alpha-MSH-LI in spinocerebellar degenerations and extrapyramidal diseases. The subjects are 11 patients with Parkinson's disease, 16 with Shy-Drager syndrome (SDS), 16 with cerebellar cortical atrophy, 3 with Machado-Joseph disease, 3 with dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy and 2 with Huntington's disease as well as 24 controls. All patients with Parkinson's disease were administered levodopa and carbidopa. CSF was sampled through lumbar puncture in the morning. After the centrifugation, supernatant of CSF was stored at -40 degrees C until used. alpha-MSH in CSF was extracted by Rainero's method and measured by RIA. alpha-MSH-LI levels in control was 23.9 +/- 2.6 pg/ml (mean +/- SD). The significant elevation was observed in Parkinson's disease (40.3 +/- 7.5, p less than 0.001) and SDS (42.3 +/- 9.4, p less than 0.001). The levels showed not significant correlation with age, duration of illness or severity of autonomic disorder. Most of other diseases demonstrated the levels within normal range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
