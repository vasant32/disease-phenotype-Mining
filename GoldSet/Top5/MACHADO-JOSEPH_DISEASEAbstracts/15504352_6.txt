Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar degeneration characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations. An unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in MJD gene on long arm of chromosome 14 has been identified as the pathologic mutation of MJD and apoptosis was previously shown to be responsible for the neuronal cell death of the disease. In this study, we utilized human neuronal SK-N-SH cells stably transfected with HA-tagged full-length MJD with 78 polyglutamine repeats to examine the effects of polyglutamine expansion on neuronal cell survival in the early stage of disease. Various pro-apoptotic agents were used to assess the tolerance of the mutant cells and to compare the differences between cells with and without mutant ataxin-3. Concentration- and time-dependent experiments showed that the increase in staurosporine-induced cell death was more pronounced and accelerated in cells containing expanded ataxin-3 via MTS assays. Interestingly, under basal conditions, Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses showed a significant decrease of Bcl-2 protein expression and an increase of cytochrome c in cells containing expanded ataxin-3 when compared with those of the parental cells. The same reduction of Bcl-2 was further confirmed in fibroblast cells with mutant ataxin-3. In addition, exogenous expression of Bcl-2 desensitized SK-N-SH-MJD78 cells to poly-Q toxicity. These results indicated that mitochondrial-mediated cell death plays a role in the pathogenesis of MJD. In our cellular model, full-length expanded ataxin-3 that leads to neurodegenerative disorders significantly impaired the expression of Bcl-2 protein, which may be, at least in part, responsible for the weak tolerance to polyglutamine toxicity at the early stage of disease and ultimately resulted in an increase of stress-induced cell death upon apoptotic stress.
