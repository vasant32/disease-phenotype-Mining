 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a group of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) or Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) (SCA3/MJD) patients and assess whether there is an association between neuropathy and serum ferritin levels and restless legs syndrome (RLS). METHODS: Twenty-six SCA3/MJD patients underwent electromyography studies to check for neuropathy. Their serum ferritin levels were measured as well. These findings were evaluated based on the presence or not of RLS and its severity. RESULTS: The proportion of neuropathy in the RLS group was not significantly higher compared to the non-RLS group (23 vs. 15%, Fisher's exact test, p = 1.000). Furthermore, no association was found between RLS and ferritin levels. CONCLUSION: We found no correlation between neuropathy or ferritin levels and RLS in SCA3/MJD patients.
