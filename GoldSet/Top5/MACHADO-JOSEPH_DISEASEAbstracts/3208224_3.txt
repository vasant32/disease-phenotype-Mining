We analysed the clinical features of 82 patients with dominantly inherited ataxia in a cohort survey. All patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for Machado-Joseph disease. The mean age of onset of symptoms was 39.8 (+/- 12.5) years and the duration of the disease was 9.2 (+/- 6.7) years. Ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and fasciculation scores correlated with age of onset and duration of disease. Upper motor neuron scores failed to correlate with age of onset. In a follow-up study we analysed the clinical data of 46 patients two years after the first examination. A paired t-test was used to compare differences between observations. The results are in agreement with those of the cross-section in time, suggesting a deterioration of the symptoms with the evolution of the disease. We conclude that dynamic definition of the disease according to age of onset and duration of symptoms is preferable to subdivision into classical types.
