We report a three generation Indian pedigree with the proband having 45 repeats at the Machado Joseph Disease (MJD)/spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) disease locus. The proband exhibited clinical features of SCA and showed signs of cerebellar and brainstem atrophy on the MRI scan. The 45 repeat allele was unstable upon inter-generational transmission and was associated with a haplotype found in the majority of MJD/SCA3 patients from around the world. This is the smallest unstable allele reported till date at the MJD/SCA3 locus and may greatly reduce the gap between normal and pathological repeat ranges.
