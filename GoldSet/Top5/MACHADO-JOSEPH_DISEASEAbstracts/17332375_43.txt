Although expansion of trinucleotide repeats accounts for over 30 human diseases, mechanisms of repeat instability remain poorly understood. We show that a Drosophila model for the CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 recapitulates key features of human CAG-repeat instability, including large repeat changes and strong expansion bias. Instability is dramatically enhanced by transcription and modulated by nuclear excision repair and a regulator of DNA repair adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein-a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) whose decreased activity contributes to polyQ disease. Pharmacological treatment to normalize acetylation suppressed instability. Thus, toxic consequences of pathogenic polyQ protein may include enhancing repeat instability.
