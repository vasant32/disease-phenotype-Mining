We reported movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) in 11 patients with lesion of the dentate nucleus (Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) 7 cases, dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA)1, myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibers (MERRF)1, dyssynergia cerebellaris myoclonica (DCM) 2), and compared with those of 7 cases of multiple system atrophy (MSA) who were postulated to have mild dentate lesions (striato-nigral degeneration 2 cases, Shy-Drager syndrome 2, sporadic olivo-ponto-cerebellar atrophy 3), and 7 control subjects without any neurological findings. Further we classified the diseases into the following two groups based on the lesion of the dentate nucleus. One was MJD group that had normal or slightly abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG), and the other was DN group (DRPLA, MERRF, DCM) that had markedly abnormal EEG. One of the main findings from this study was smaller slope of the Ns' in the MJD and DN group and normal slope of BP. There was no significant difference in the slope of Ns' between MJD patients and DN patients. This result shows EEG abnormalities have no influence on MRCP recordings. These results suggest that Ns' component may reflect the function in the cerebellar dentate nucleus, and that MRCP is a useful diagnostic method in patients with cerebellar ataxia.
