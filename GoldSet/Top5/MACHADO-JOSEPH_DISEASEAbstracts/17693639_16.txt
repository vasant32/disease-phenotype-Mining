Ataxin-3, a deubiquitinating enzyme, is the disease protein in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, one of many neurodegenerative disorders caused by polyglutamine expansion. Little is known about the cellular regulation of ataxin-3. This is an important issue, since growing evidence links disease protein context to pathogenesis in polyglutamine disorders. Expanded ataxin-3, for example, is more neurotoxic in fruit fly models when its active site cysteine is mutated (1). We therefore sought to determine the influence of ataxin-3 enzymatic activity on various cellular properties. Here we present evidence that the catalytic activity of ataxin-3 regulates its cellular turnover, ubiquitination, and subcellular distribution. Cellular protein levels of catalytically inactive ataxin-3 were much higher than those of active ataxin-3, in part reflecting slower degradation. In vitro studies revealed that inactive ataxin-3 was more slowly degraded by the proteasome and that this degradation occurred independent of ubiquitination. Slower degradation of inactive ataxin-3 correlated with reduced interaction with the proteasome shuttle protein, VCP/p97. Enzymatically active ataxin-3 also showed a greater tendency to concentrate in the nucleus, where it colocalized with the proteasome in subnuclear foci. Taken together, these and other findings suggest that the catalytic activity of this disease-linked deubiquitinating enzyme regulates several of its cellular properties, which in turn may influence disease pathogenesis.
