 BACKGROUND: An increase in CAG trinucleotide repeat length in the androgen receptor (AR) gene has been linked to idiopathic azoospermia. METHODS: In order to test whether other (CAG/CTG)(n) loci are also affected, the (CAG/CTG)(n) frequency distribution at myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) loci, in addition to the AR gene, was investigated in 48 azoospermia patients and 47 controls. RESULTS: The median CAG repeat length in the AR gene was significantly longer in azoospermia patients than in controls (23 versus 21, P < 0.001). Significant differences were also noted in the upper tails of trinucleotide repeat length distributions at both DM1 and MJD loci between the two populations. At the DM1 locus, alleles of more than 18 repeats were observed only in azoospermia patients, and not in controls (P = 0.014). At the MJD locus, the frequency of normal alleles (ANs) with 29 or more CAG repeats was also much higher in azoospermia patients (29.2 versus 7.4%; P = 0.0001). However, the repeat length distribution at DRPLA and SCA8 loci did not differ in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicated that, at least in a subset of azoospermia patients, there was an increase in the number of trinucleotide repeats in some disease loci. Thus, it is noteworthy to evaluate whether offspring of these azoospermia patients, if born by assisted reproductive technologies, have an increased risk of trinucleotide repeat diseases.
