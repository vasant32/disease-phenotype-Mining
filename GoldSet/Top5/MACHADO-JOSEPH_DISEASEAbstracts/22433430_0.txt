Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity is a major problem because it represents the dose-limiting side effect of a significant number of antineoplastic drugs, such as vinca alkaloids. Hereditary neuropathies usually predispose to severe vincristine neurotoxicity. Here, we report the case of a 56-year-old man with Machado-Joseph disease, also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, treated with a vinca alkaloid without exacerbation of neurological symptoms.
