Despite much effort, a 74 year old man with progressive proximal weakness and sensory disturbances due to axonal neuropathy remained a diagnostic problem. Investigation of his family disclosed an additional patient with a cerebellar syndrome and a family member with mainly pyramidal features. Analysis of DNA showed a CAG repeat expansion in the Machado-Joseph disease gene in all three patients. Although not conclusively proved, we think that the neuropathy of the index case is linked to the CAG repeat expansion. Machado-Joseph disease should be considered in progressive axonal neuropathy.
