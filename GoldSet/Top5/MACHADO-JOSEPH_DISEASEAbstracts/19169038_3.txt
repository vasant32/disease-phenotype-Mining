 BACKGROUND: The prevalence of disease subtypes of spinocerebellar degenerations (SCDs) varies between countries, and even between areas within a country. We report unprecedented epidemiologic data on SCDs in the Hokuriku district, which is located in the central, western part of Japan. METHODS: Clinical and genetic data on SCD patients were obtained via questionnaires distributed to all the departments of neurology, psychiatry and internal medicine in the Hokuriku district (n = 418). RESULTS: Among the SCD patients, autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) were noted in 40.4%, multiple system atrophy in 24.7%, cortical cerebellar atrophy in 13.3% and autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia in 0.3%. Genetically confirmed ADCA patients included those with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3; 63.3%), SCA6 (20.0%), ADCA linked to chromosome 16q22.1 (10.0%), dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (4.4%), SCA1 (1.1%) and SCA2 (1.1%). MJD/SCA3 was highly prevalent in the Toyama prefecture of the Hokuriku district, accounting for 90% of genetically confirmed ADCAs by birthplace; MJD/SCA3 patients were concentrated in the Gosei area, the western part of the Toyama prefecture, giving an estimated prevalence of 19.1 per 100,000 inhabitants. CONCLUSIONS: The Hokuriku district, especially the Gosei area of Toyama, had a surprisingly high relative frequency and prevalence of MJD/SCA3, which is comparable to that in the Azores, Portugal.
