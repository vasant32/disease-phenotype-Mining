A new screening method was developed for the detection of CAG expanded alleles in patients with hereditary ataxia using polymerase chain reaction-based microtiter plate hybridization (PCR-MPH). The system can be applied to detect pathologic alleles by hybridization with the immobilized (CAG)48 repeat probe derived from the unrelated gene 'ERDA1' except for the CAG repeats. We examined 10 individuals with SCA3, 10 with Huntington disease and 30 normal controls (31 controls for SCA3) using this method. The results showed that a clear discrimination was possible in all cases. We suggest that this system be made available for mass screening of patients with hereditary ataxia disorders. This report is the first to demonstrate that a PCR-MPH system can be successfully applied to DNA size differentiation in addition to base pair mismatches. Also, our design of the probe is unique in that the probe motif stem from the unrelated gene sequence and not from the synthetic oligonucleotides.
