Polyglutamine diseases are characterized by neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs) of expanded polyglutamine proteins, indicating the failure of protein degradation. UBB(+1), an aberrant form of ubiquitin, is a substrate and inhibitor of the proteasome, and was previously reported to accumulate in Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies. Here, we show accumulation of UBB(+1) in the NIIs and the cytoplasm of neurons in Huntington disease and spinocerebellar ataxia type-3, indicating inhibition of the proteasome by polyglutamine proteins in human brain. We found that UBB(+1) not only increased aggregate formation of expanded polyglutamines in neuronally differentiated cell lines, but also had a synergistic effect on apoptotic cell death due to expanded polyglutamine proteins. These findings implicate UBB(+1) as an aggravating factor in polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration, and clearly identify an important role for the ubiquitin-proteasome system in polyglutamine diseases.
