Syntheses of peptides containing contiguous repeats of glutamine or asparagine, related to sequences derived from proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases, are described. Such homo-polymeric peptides are notoriously difficult to prepare due to the formation of aggregated structures during their solid phase synthesis. A novel approach using a randomized array of side chain protected and unprotected residues proved to be an effective strategy for preventing intermolecular peptide-chain association.
