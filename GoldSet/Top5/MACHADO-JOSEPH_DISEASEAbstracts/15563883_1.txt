 BACKGROUND: NSE and S100B are considered as neuronal and glial peripheral markers of central nervous system pathologies, respectively. We evaluated the potential use of S100B and NSE serum concentrations as peripheral markers of symptomatic patients with Machado Joseph disease (MJD). METHODS: We measured S100B and NSE peripheral concentrations of 22 MJD patients and compared with healthy subjects concentrations. The correlations of both markers with CAG repeat size, age of onset, disease duration, and the scores of the Extended Disability Status Scale of Kurtzke, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale were also assessed. RESULTS: S100B serum concentrations between control and MJD subjects were not statistically different, whereas NSE serum concentrations were higher in MJD patients than in control subjects (p=0.00001). S100B presented a moderate correlation with disease duration and depression score, whereas NSE presented a moderate correlation with depression score and a good negative correlation with EDSS score. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic MJD patients present increased concentrations of NSE and normal concentrations of S100B in blood.
