The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia. Recently, among the ataxias, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy have been found to be caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the coding region of the disease genes. We have analyzed the CAG repeats of 67 patients from 47 families with dominantly inherited ataxia who lived in the Kinki area of Japan. The following results were obtained. First, 31 patients from 22 families were found to be positive for the MJD repeat expansion, indicating that MJD is the most common dominantly inherited ataxia in the Kinki area of Japan. Second, no SCA1 repeat expansion was found among the families studied. This presents a striking contrast to the fact that there are many families with SCA1 in Hokkaido and the Tohoku area of Japan. These findings suggest geographic variation in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in Japan.
