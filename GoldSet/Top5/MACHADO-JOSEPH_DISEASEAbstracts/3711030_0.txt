A 76-year-old patient is described in whom a severe, life-threatening tardive dyskinesia developed after oral administration of approximately 2 mg of haloperidol per day for 4 weeks. The patient's strong genetic predisposition for Joseph disease may have potentiated both the development and the severity of the tardive dyskinesia. Withdrawal of neuroleptic agents accompanied by aggressive treatment with reserpine resulted in a complete recovery over 5 weeks. The clinical and pathologic characteristics of Joseph disease and tardive dyskinesia are compared.
