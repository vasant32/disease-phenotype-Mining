We present linkage analysis on a large Swedish five-generation family of 15 affected individuals with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) associated with retinal degeneration and anticipation. Common clinical signs in this family include ataxia, dysarthria and severely impaired vision with the phenotype ADCA type II. Different subtypes of ADCA have proven difficult to classify clinically due to extensive phenotypic variability within and between families. Genetic analysis of a number of ADCA type I families shows that heterogeneity exists also genetically. During the last few years several types of ADCA type I have been localized and to date six genetically distinct forms have been identified including SCA1 (6p), SCA2 (12q), SCA3 and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) (14q), SCA4 (16q), and finally SCA5 (11). We performed a genome-wide search of the Swedish ADCA type II family using a total of 270 microsatellite markers. Positive lod scores were obtained with a number of microsatellite markers located on chromosome 3p12-p21.1. Three markers gave lod scores over 3 with a maximum lod score of 4.53 achieved with the marker D3S1600. The ADCA type II gene could be restricted to a region of 32 cM by the markers D3S1547 and D3S1274.
