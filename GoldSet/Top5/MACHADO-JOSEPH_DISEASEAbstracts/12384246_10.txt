Owing to its anatomical connections, the external cuneate nucleus (ECU) plays a crucial role in processing proprioceptive input from the upper trunk and upper limbs. Here, we studied this dorsal column nucleus post-mortem in five individuals with clinically diagnosed and genetically confirmed spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease, who had manifested upper trunk and upper limb ataxia. Polyethylene glycol-embedded 100-microm sections stained for lipofuscin pigment and Nissl material, as well as paraffin-embedded Nissl-stained thin sections, revealed serious neuronal loss in the ECU of all five SCA3 patients. As observed in other affected central nervous system structures, the ECU of these individuals displayed an astrogliosis, and some of the few surviving neurons harbored one or even two ataxin-3-immunopositive intranuclear inclusion bodies. The findings of the present study suggest that (1) the ECU is among the consistent targets of the degenerative process underlying SCA3 and (2) interruption of the proprioceptive pathway at the level of the ECU contributes significantly to upper limb and trunk ataxia in SCA3 patients.
