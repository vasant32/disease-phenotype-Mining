Few studies on transcranial brain sonography have been performed in hereditary and non-hereditary ataxias. The objective of the present study was to report transcranial brain sonography findings in a sample of clinically and molecularly proven Machado-Joseph disease patients and to compare these data against those of an age- and gender-matched control group. A cross-sectional study on transcranial brain sonography was conducted in 30 Machado-Joseph disease patients. Transcranial brain sonography was performed by an experienced sonographer blinded to the clinical, genetic, and neuroimaging data. The results were compared with those of a control group of 44 healthy subjects matched for age and gender. The sonographic findings were also correlated with clinical features and genetic data in Machado-Joseph disease group. A significantly higher frequency of substantia nigra and lenticular nucleus hyperechogenicity was found in the Machado-Joseph disease group compared to an age- and gender-matched healthy control group (p<0.001). The substantia nigra echogenic area proved to be the best predictor for differentiating cases from controls. Third and lateral ventricles were significantly larger in the Machado-Joseph disease patients than in the control subjects. No significant correlations were found between transcranial brain sonography findings and Machado-Joseph disease demographic/clinical data. Transcranial brain sonography findings in Machado-Joseph disease patients differed significantly to those in age- and gender-matched controls. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity occurred frequently in Machado-Joseph disease patients and was found to be the best predictor for differentiating cases from controls. Additionally, this data describes the occurrence of brain atrophy in Machado-Joseph disease group.
