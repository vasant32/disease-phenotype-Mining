A 51-year-old woman, with progressive gait disturbance and dysarthria, had been diagnosed as Menzel-type spinocerebellar degeneration. Later, she developed dystonic posture of upper limbs and bulging eyes. She was diagnosed as Machado-Joseph disease from neurological findings, which consisted of cerebellar signs, pyramidal tract signs and extrapyramidal tract signs and peripheral neuropathy. She died suddenly of unknown origin. Her illness lasted about 13 years. Neuropathological findings showed moderate neuronal loss with gliosis in the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, oculomotor and hypoglossal nucleus and anterior horn. Positron emission tomography (PET) using 15O steady state inhalation technique revealed reduction of cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen in not only cerebellum but also cerebral cortex. These findings are different from typical PET findings of spinocerebellar degeneration.
