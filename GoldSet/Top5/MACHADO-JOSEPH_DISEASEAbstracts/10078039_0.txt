Convulsive seizure with unconciousness is an adverse effect of new quinolone antibiotics including fleroxacin. A block of GABA receptor in CNS has been reported as pathomechanism. A 48-year-old female patient with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) had encephalopathy induced by fleroxacin. She revealed unconsciousness after the administration of fleroxacin (200mg/day) for three days. Electroencephrogram (EEG) showed diffuse slow waves. The administration was discontinued and her consciousness became clear after a day. The abnormal findings on EEG disappeared gradually. The concentrations of fleroxacin were within normal limits in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. The patient with MJD might have a tendency to develop encephalopathy by fleroxacin, because the GABA-ergic nervous system could be involved in MJD.
