In this investigation we assess the utility of the masseter reflex for diagnostic purposes in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias. We studied the masseter reflex electrophysiologically in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2, 10 patients) and type 3 (SCA3/MJD, 13 patients). In SCA2, the masseter reflex was abnormal in 9 (90%) patients. In SCA3/MJD, the masseter reflex was normal in all 13 patients. Our findings suggest that the masseter reflex is a reliable test that provides additional data prior to molecular study in the differentiation between SCA2 and SCA3/MJD. Masseter reflex abnormalities in SCA2 patients could be better explained by dysfunction of the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus/tract.
