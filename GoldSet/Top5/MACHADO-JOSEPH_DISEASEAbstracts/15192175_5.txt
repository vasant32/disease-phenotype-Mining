A genetically confirmed case of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA 3), presenting with disabling foot dystonia, peripheral neuropathy, and minimal cerebellar signs is reported. The dystonia improved dramatically with levodopa treatment in the absence of additional parkinsonian feature. A trial of levodopa for dystonia in SCA 3 may be of therapeutic benefit, at least in the initial stage of the disease.
