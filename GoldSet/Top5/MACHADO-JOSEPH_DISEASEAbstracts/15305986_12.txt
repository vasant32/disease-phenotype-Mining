Although the vestibular complex represents an important component of the neural circuits crucial for the maintenance of truncal and postural stability, and it is integrated into specialized oculomotor circuits, knowledge regarding the extent of the involvement of its nuclei and associated fibre tracts in cases with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is incomplete. Accordingly, we performed a pathoanatomical analysis of the vestibular complex and its associated fibre tracts in four clinically diagnosed and genetically confirmed SCA3 patients with the aim of providing more exact information as to the involvement of the vestibular system in this disorder. By means of unconventionally thick serial sections through the vestibular nuclei stained for lipofuscin pigment and Nissl material, we could show that all five nuclei of this complex (interstitial, lateral, medial, spinal, and superior vestibular nuclei) are subject to neurodegenerative processes in SCA3, whereby examination of thick serial sections stained for myelin revealed that all associated fibre tracts (ascending tract of Deiters, juxtarestiform body, lateral and medial vestibulospinal tracts, medial longitudinal fascicle, vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve) underwent atrophy and demyelinization in all four of the patients studied. The reported lesions can help to explain the truncal and postural instability as well as the impaired optokinetic nystagmus, vestibulo-ocular reaction, and horizontal gaze-holding present in SCA3 cases.
