 OBJECTIVE: It has been reported that autoimmune cerebellar ataxias, such as anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-antibody-positive cerebellar ataxia and gluten ataxia, are treatable. Here, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) on autoantibody-positive cerebellar ataxia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IVIg therapy was administered in seven autoantibody-positive cerebellar ataxia patients. Therapeutic efficacy was examined in terms of its effects on clinical symptoms and changes in brain perfusion using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). RESULTS: Treatment was effective in four cerebellar cortical atrophy patients (two anti-GAD antibody-positive and two anti-gliadin antibody-positive) and in one anti-thyroid antibody-positive spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) patient, but not in two multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients. All four IVIg effective patients who underwent SPECT showed apparent increases in cerebellar perfusion. CONCLUSION: If cerebellar ataxia with an autoimmune mechanism is suspected and radiological findings do not reveal MSA, it is worth considering immunotherapy including IVIg.
