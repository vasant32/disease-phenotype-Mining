A highly sensitive silver technique for glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCI) in olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) was applied to tissues from 15 patients with neurodegenerative disorders including OPCA, Joseph disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's chorea, Pick disease and three control non-neurological subjects. Brain tissue from both OPCA and AD impregnated positively. Neurons, astroglia and oligodendroglia in the putamen, pontine nucleus and inferior olivary nucleus all impregnated in addition to white matter oligodendroglia. Neuronal inclusions in the pontine nucleus appeared as compact or fibrillary masses, and GCI-bearing oligodendroglia and astrocytes showed homogeneously impregnated somata. The myelinated pontocerebellar tract and the white matter surrounding the inferior olivary nucleus contained a small number of impregnated nerve fibres with a hollow structure, which resembled the myelin sheath. Immunocytochemical studies to clarify these argyrophilic structures in the OPCA subjects employed paired helical filament (PHF), microtubule associated proteins (MAPs), MAP1, MAP2, MAP5, tau, ubiquitin, neurofilament (200 or 70 kilodaltons) and myelin basic protein (MBP) antisera. GCI-bearing white matter oligodendroglia expressed PHF, tau, MAP5 and ubiquitin immunoreactives and non-argyrophilic astroglia were positive for MAP5 antiserum alone. In the putamen, pontine nuclei and inferior olivary nuclei, impregnated neurons as well as the GCI-bearing oligodendroglia immunostained with PHF, tau, MAP5 and ubiquitin antisera and impregnated astroglia were also immunoreactive to these antisera except for being tau negative in the putamen. Silver impregnated nerve fibres showed only MBP immunoreactivity. These findings indicate that the argyrophilia in the OPCA subjects closely correlates with PHF and tau immunoreactivities.
