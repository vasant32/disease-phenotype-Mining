The cerebellar variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-C) has overlapping clinical features with the hereditary spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), but can usually be distinguished on a clinical basis. We describe a patient who developed a sporadic, late-onset, rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder consistent with MSA-C. Genetic testing, however, showed an abnormal expansion of one allele of the spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) gene. The clinical impression of MSA-C was confirmed by identification of numerous alpha-synuclein-containing glial cytoplasmic inclusions on autopsy. These findings suggest that abnormal expansion of the SCA3 gene may be a risk factor for the development of MSA-C.
