Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), an autosomal dominant, progressive, multisystem degeneration with cerebellar ataxia as the cardinal manifestation, usually affects individuals of Portuguese ancestry from the Azorean Islands. Cases have been reported in families from Japan, India, China, Brazil, and Australia. We report the first Israeli Jewish family with MJD, originating from a remote village near Ta'izz in Yemen.
