The expansion of unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat polymorphisms of a number of genes causes several neurodegenerative disorders with decreased cognitive function, the severity of the disorder being related to allele length at the triplet repeat locus. While the effects of repeat length have been well studied in clinical samples, there has been little investigation of the effects of triplet repeat variation in the normal range for these genes. We have, therefore, examined linkage and association for three CAG triplet repeat markers (Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1, SCA1; Machado-Joseph Disease, MJD; Dentatorubro-pallidoluysian Atrophy, DRPLA) to assess their contribution to variation in cognitive ability (IQ, reading ability, processing speed) in a normal, unselected sample of adolescent twins (248 dizygotic (DZ) sibling pairs, aged 16 years). Association tests, performed in Mx and QTDT, showed a consistent positive association of SCA1 with Arithmetic (P = 0.04). While association was supported between SCA1 and Cambridge reading scores and between DRPLA and inspection time, results were inconsistent across software packages. Given the number of statistical tests performed, it is unlikely that trinucleotide repeat variation in the normal range for these genes influences variation in normal cognition.
