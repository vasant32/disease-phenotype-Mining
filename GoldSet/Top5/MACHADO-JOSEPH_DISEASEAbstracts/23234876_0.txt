Objective: Neuropathy is a well-recognized feature in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) or Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), but the pattern of neuropathy is still a matter of debate. This study aimed to evaluate peripheral nerve involvement in MJD patients. Neurophysiological and clinical data were analyzed to distinguish neuronopathy from length-dependent distal axonopathy. Methods: In the present study we evaluated 26 patients with clinical and molecular-proven MJD and investigated their peripheral nerve involvement. Neurophysiological and clinical data were compared and correlated aiming to distinguish neuronopathy from distal axonopathy. Results: The neurophysiological evaluation showed that 42.3% of the patients had polyneuropathy. Among these patients, 81.8% presented neuronopathy. Conclusion: We concluded that neuronopathy is the most common form of peripheral nerve involvement in MJD patients.
