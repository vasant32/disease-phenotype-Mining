 OBJECTIVE: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of polyglutamine tract near the C-terminus of the MJD1 gene product, ataxin-3. The precise mechanism of the MJD/SCA3 pathogenesis remains unclear. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that phosphorylation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases. However, few kinases are known to phosphorylate ataxin-3. The present study is to explore whether ataxin-3 is a substrate of casein kinase 2 (CK2). METHODS: The interaction between ataxin-3 and CK2 was identified by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipition assay. The phosphorylation of ataxin-3 by CK2 was measured by in vitro phosphorylation assays. Results (1) Both wild type and expanded ataxin-3 interacted with CK2alpha and CK2beta in vitro. (2) In 293 cells, both wild type and expanded ataxin-3 interacted with CK2beta, but not CK2alpha. (3) CK2 phosphorylated wild type and expanded ataxin-3. CONCLUSION: Ataxin-3 is a substrate of protein kinase CK2.
