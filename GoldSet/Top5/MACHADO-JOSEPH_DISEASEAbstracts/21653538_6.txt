Mutant ataxin-3 is aberrantly folded and proteolytically cleaved in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. The C-terminal region of the protein includes a polyglutamine stretch that is expanded in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Here, we report on the analysis of an ataxin-3 mutant mouse that has been obtained by gene trap integration. The ataxin-3 fusion protein encompasses 259 N-terminal amino acids including the Josephin domain and an ubiquitin-interacting motif but lacks the C-terminus with the polyglutamine stretch, the valosin-containing protein binding region and part of the ubiquitin-interacting motif 2. Homozygous ataxin-3 mutant mice were viable and showed no apparent anatomical defects at birth. However, at the age of 9 months, homozygous and heterozygous mutant mice revealed significantly altered behaviour and progressing deficits of motor coordination followed by premature death at ∼12 months. At this time, prominent extranuclear protein aggregates and neuronal cell death was found in mutant mice. This was associated with disturbances of the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated unfolded protein response, consistent with the normal role of ataxin-3 in endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis. Thus, the ataxin-3 gene trap model provides evidence for a contribution of the non-polyglutamine containing ataxin-3 N-terminus, which mimics a calpain fragment that has been observed in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Consistent with the disease in humans, gene trap mice develop cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and implicate impaired unfolded protein response in the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.
