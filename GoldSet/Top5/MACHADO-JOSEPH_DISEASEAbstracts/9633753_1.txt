We studied the frequency and characteristics of brainstem and thalamic lesions in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy using MRI. Of 15 subjects diagnosed by DNA analysis, 13 had lesions in the pontine base, nine in the midbrain, and five in the thalamus. Lesions were correlated positively with the patient's age, but not with neurologic features or numbers of CAG repeats. Patients with Machado-Joseph disease or spinocerebellar ataxia 1 did not show these characteristic lesions.
