 OBJECTIVES: To highlight an unexpected clinical presentation and to review the associated polyneuropathy phenotypes of SCA3. DESIGN: Clinical follow-up. SETTING: Neurological referral center. PATIENT: Middle-aged man with no family history for SCA3. RESULTS: Presentation with an isolated axonal, distal, symmetric, sensorimotor polyneuropathy for 6 years before developing a cerebellar syndrome prompting genetic testing for SCA3. CONCLUSION: SCA3 can present with an isolated axonal, distal, symmetric, sensorimotor polyneuropathy.
