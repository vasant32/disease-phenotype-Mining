Four pedigrees of Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) were reported. Main clinical features of 21 patients in these pedigrees were cerebellar ataxia, limb spasticity, gaze nystagmus, facio-lingual twitchings, and external ophthalmoparesis. Amyotrophy, hypokinesia, or dystonia were manifested with advance of the illness. In patients with younger onset age, such extrapyramidal signs were dominated. Neuropathological study of one autopsied case disclosed that there were degeneration of spinocerebellar tract, anterior horn cells, pontine nuclei, dentate nucleus, red nucleus, substantia nigra, internal segment of globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and motor nuclei of brain stem; neurons of cerebellar cortex and inferior olivary nucleus were preserved. From these clinical and pathological features, these 4 pedigrees satisfied the criteria of MJD, and were differentiated from hereditary olivopontocerebellar atrophy. Currently, MJD is accepted as a new entity of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxias. However, there are still controversies as to whether Azores-Portuguese MJD and Japanese MJD are identical disorder. Furthermore, the nosological relationship between MJD and a number of similar cases, as reported historically under the diagnosis of Brown type ataxia or Marie's ataxia, has not been clearly established. From reviewing such cases critically, pathological and clinical features of our cases are so similar to those of the latter, indicating that the probably identical genetic disorder has been classified under the different categories.
