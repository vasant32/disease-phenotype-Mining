We studied the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in leukocytes from 23 patients with dominantly inherited ataxia. All the patients were assessed with a rating scale for ataxias and met the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of Machado-Joseph disease. The mean age of onset of symptoms was 37.8, SD 13.4 years and the duration of the disease was 7.4, SD 4.9. Leukocyte GDH activity was significantly decreased (p < 0.001) when compared to 20 normal controls. These data extend previous reports indicating that a GDH deficiency is present in peripheral tissues from some patients with spinocerebellar degenerations. Furthermore, this study suggests that a genetic deficiency of GDH may underlie some forms of dominant ataxias; this deficiency may be marked in patients with Machado-Joseph disease and is not specific for any type of multiple system atrophy.
