Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder in families of Portuguese-Azorean ancestry. The gene responsible for MJD has been assigned to a 29-cM interval on chromosome 14q. A large Brazilian family with MJD was genotyped with six new microsatellite markers spanning 19 cM on chromosome 14q. Linkage analysis and haplotype reconstruction reduced the MJD candidate region to a 3-cM interval between markers D14S280 and D14S81, permitting positional cloning. This interval also contains the spinal cerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) gene, responsible for a genetic subtype of the type I autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, clinically related to MJD. This result supports the hypothesis that abnormalities in the same gene may be responsible for both disorders. The minor clinical differences between the two diseases may result from allelic heterogeneity.
