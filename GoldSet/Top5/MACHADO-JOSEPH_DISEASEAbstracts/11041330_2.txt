Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 7 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by neural loss, mainly in the cerebellum and regions of the brainstem and particularly the inferior olivary complex. This neurodegeneration disease is associated with expansion of unstable CAG repeats within the 5'-translated region of the SCA7 gene, located on chromosome 3p. We conducted a local survey of the normal population and candidate patients for the analysis of the CAG repeats in the SCA7 gene. The distributions of the CAG repeat units of SCA7 gene in the normal population in Taiwan were established in this study by using the radioactive genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The normal range of CAG repeats is from 6 to 17 repeats, with the more common being around 8-13 repeats. The range is narrower than that reported for other ethnic groups (7-35 CAGs). Meanwhile, by the use of a combination of PCR and Southern blot analysis, one SCA7 family was identified and is reported here. A marked instability of the CAG repeat number during transmission from father to son (41 vs. 100) was observed in the SCA7 family. Clinical anticipation is significant in this family including an infantile case, who was found to have nystagmus from the age of 1 month. To date, the SCA7 mutation has been detected in one of 73 families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia phenotypes, which is about 1.4% of the ataxia families referred to us, compared to 1.4% SCA1, 9.6% SCA2, and 27.3% SCA3/Machado-Joseph disease in our collection. In addition, we demonstrate that the PCR-based Southern blot analysis, with the advantages of sensitivity of PCR and specificity of Southern blot, is a reliable diagnostic method for SCA7 mutation screening. The molecular analysis technique makes possible the quick and accurate diagnosis of SCA7 patients and in the future will hopefully be applied to prenatal screening for SCA7 families.
