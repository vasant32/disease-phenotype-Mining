A Portuguese family of non-Azorean origin is described as affected by an autosomal dominant inherited ataxia resembling Machado-Joseph disease. Clinical criteria for diagnosis are proposed, based on a complex clinical picture extending from extrapyramidal signs to peripheral amyotrophy associated with secondary, but more specific, minor features such as progressive external ophthalmoplegia, dystonia, intention fasciculation-like movements of facial and lingual muscles, and bulging eyes. Machado-Joseph disease may be more widespread than previously believed.
