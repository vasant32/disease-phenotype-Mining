 BACKGROUND: We investigated the frequencies of the symptoms such as "ataxia, depression, insomnia, anorexia, and pain," that have been reported to be associated with 5-HT1A receptor, and the effect of tandospirone citrate (tandospirone: 5-HT1A agonist) in patients with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). METHODS: Ten MJD patients received tandospirone (15-30 mg/d) for seven weeks. During that time, they were evaluated weekly using the Ataxia Rating Scale (ARS) and Total Length Traveled (TLT) by Stabilimetry tests, the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), which in addition to evaluating their level of depression, also evaluated their degree of insomnia and anorexia, and a pain questionnaire. RESULTS: Before tandospirone therapy, all patients displayed cerebellar ataxia, while insomnia, and leg pain was observed in 7 patients, depression in 6 patients, and anorexia was observed in 2 patients. In response to treatment, 7 of the 10 patients who were ataxic showed a reduction in their ARS, while 3 of 6 patients showed a reduction in their SDS, and 5 of 7 patients showed an alleviation of their insomnia and leg pain. Both of the affected patients showed a marked improvement in their anorexia. A stabilimetry test could be performed in 7 patients, 5 of whom showed a reduction in TLT. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the patients with MJD are prone to manifest 5-HT1A receptor-associated symptoms, and tandospirone is a useful drug for these symptoms in patients with MJD, though a double-blind study is needed.
