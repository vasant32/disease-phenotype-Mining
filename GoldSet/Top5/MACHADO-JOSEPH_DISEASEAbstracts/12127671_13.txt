The presence of neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs) and neuronal mosaicism has been described in some autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA), but their implication in neurodegenerative mechanisms still remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between neuronal loss and NIIs, and the size of CAG triplet expansion in selected areas of the CNS in two SCA3 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Postmortem neuropathological study was carried out, and the regional distribution of neuronal loss was compared with NIIs. CAG expansion was analysed by PCR amplification in the same regions. RESULTS: Marked neuronal loss was seen in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, pontine nuclei and motor nuclei of the brain stem. Moderate neurone loss was found in the locus ceruleus, colliculus and substantia nigra. Loss of granule and Purkinje cells was found in the cerebellum, mainly in the vermis. NIIs were present in neurones of the involved nuclei of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, medulla oblongata and pons, but not in the locus ceruleus, substantia nigra and cerebellum. A few NIIs were found in the striatum. The number of CAG repeats was 27/70 in the first patient and 21/74 in the second patient. The variation of the expanded allele size among different cerebral areas was +/-1-3 CAG repeats. CONCLUSION: The partial correlation between neuronal loss and NIIs suggests that other factors distinct from NII formation may be involved in the neuronal death. Moreover, the low degree of mosaicism between regions without neuronal loss and regions with marked neuronal loss points to the existence of selective cellular vulnerability to the genetic defect.
