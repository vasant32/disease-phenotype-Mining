In 1964, Lewis reported a familial ataxia-dysautonomia syndrome reminiscent of Shy-Drager syndrome subsequently known as multiple system atrophy (MSA). Here we review this report and propose that the Lewis family may represent an unusual form of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I, which might be categorized either as SCA3 (Machado-Joseph disease) or a new SCA subtype. There remains no conclusive evidence to support the notion of hereditary MSA.
