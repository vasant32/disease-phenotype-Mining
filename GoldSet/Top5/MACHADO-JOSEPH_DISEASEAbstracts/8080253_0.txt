We measured the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of beta-endorphin in 7 Japanese patients with Joseph disease and compared them with control values. The 7 patients included 4 with type I and 3 with type II disease; their mean age was 45.7 +/- 12.09 years. Diseased controls were matched in age to the patients studied. In these patients, CSF beta-endorphin level was significantly lower than in the controls (40% of normal values). An alteration in CSF beta-endorphin level may explain some of the neurological impairment found in Joseph disease.
