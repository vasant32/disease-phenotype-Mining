Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the gene product, ataxin-3. We have previously shown that mutant ataxin-3 causes upregulation of inflammatory genes in transgenic SCA3 cell lines and human SCA3 pontine neurons. We report here a complex pattern of transcriptional changes by microarray gene expression profiling and Northern blot analysis in a SCA3 cell model. Twenty-three differentially expressed genes involved in inflammatory reactions, nuclear transcription, and cell surface-associated processes were identified. The identified corresponding proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in human disease and control brain tissue to evaluate their implication in SCA3 pathogenesis. In addition to several inflammatory mediators upregulated in mutant ataxin-3 expressing cell lines and pontine neurons of SCA3 patients, we identified a profound repression of genes encoding cell surface-associated proteins in cells overexpressing normal ataxin-3. Correspondingly, these genes were upregulated in mutant ataxin-3 expressing cell lines and in pontine neurons of SCA3 patients. These findings identify for the first time target genes transcriptionally regulated by normal ataxin-3 and support the hypothesis that both loss of normal ataxin-3 and gain of function through protein-protein interacting properties of mutant ataxin-3 contribute to SCA3 pathogenesis.
