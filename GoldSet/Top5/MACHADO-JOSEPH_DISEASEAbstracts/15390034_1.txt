Machado-Joseph shoe (MJS), defined as a shoe/slipper with a deep hallux imprint at its base, and hyperostosis/osteoma toe were two early ataxic signs in 17 of 31 patients (55%) and 24 of 31 patients (77%) with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), respectively. The MJS plus hyperostosis/osteoma toes may be helpful in the diagnosis of MJD in a patient during early truncal ataxia.
