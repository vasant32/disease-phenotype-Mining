Several clinical trials have been reported in which monoclonal antibodies (McAb) were used for therapy of lymphoid malignancies. Such trials have shown that infusion of McAb recognizing lymphoid antigens, is well-tolerated, and leads to the coating of tumor cells and tumor regression in some patients. However, the tumoricidal capacity of a McAb is hampered by the presence of circulating free antigen, antigenic modulation, development of human anti-mouse antibodies, emergence of antigen-negative variants of tumor cells and the inadequacy of host-effector cell mechanisms. We have studied the antigenic modulation induced by immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain switch variants of anti-CD19 McAb. Modulation of CD19 molecules was not related to the IgG subclass of the McAb. Immunofluorescence studies on the Burkitt tumor cell line Daudi showed that CD19 molecules are internalized after incubation by anti-CD19 McAb. Next, the effect of cytoskeleton inhibitors on antigenic modulation was studied. We found that antigenic modulation on Daudi cells and on an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line was completely inhibited by vinca alkaloids (VA) or by colchicine. Interestingly, antigenic modulation of tumor cells from a VA-resistant patient, was not inhibited by VA or colchicine. These findings provide information for the rational design of more effective clinical trials with McAb.
