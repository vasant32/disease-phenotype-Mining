Congenital acute leukemia is a rare form of childhood leukemia, in which lineage conversion at relapse is very rarely reported. Here we describe a case of congenital B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with t(4;11) and t(1;6) translocations, which at relapse underwent a switch to monocytic lineage with persistence of the original cytogenetic translocations and clonal rearrangement of the JH gene. Similar to the other described cases of congenital acute leukemia with lineage conversion, our case had a MLL gene rearrangement and followed an aggressive clinical course.
