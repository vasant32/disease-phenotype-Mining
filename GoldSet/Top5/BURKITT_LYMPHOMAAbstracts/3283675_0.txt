Limiting dilution analysis, a technique which measures the ability of cells to form colonies in liquid media has been used to quantitative residual cells subsequent to treatment. The reliability of this in vitro test as a tool in the selection of process of bone marrow purging was examined. With conventional methods like release of 51Chrome a 2 log reduction could be evaluated, while a reduction of 4 log was assessed by limiting dilution analysis for a same treatment. However the sensibility of this method depends of several factors which we have been examined in this study.
