 PURPOSE: The ZAP-70 gene is normally expressed in T and natural killer cells, where it is required for the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. More recently, it has been described that ZAP-70 contributes to the B-cell development at early stages of B-cell differentiation in mice. The purpose was to investigate the presence of ZAP-70 in normal pro/pre B cells and mature B cells and in tumoral cells from B-acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ZAP-70 expression was ascertained by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, Western blot, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Analysis of ZAP-70 and other signaling proteins of the pre-TCR/TCR was done by Western blot. RESULTS: ZAP-70 was expressed in pro/pre B cells but not in normal mature B cells derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or tonsil. Among tumoral cells, ZAP-70 was expressed in 56% of B-ALLs with pro/pre B-cell phenotype and in 4 of 6 Burkitt/ALL lymphomas. In B-ALL cells, expression of CD38 protein correlated with ZAP-70 expression (P = 0.05). Mutational analysis of the ZAP-70 gene revealed the absence of mutations in cases lacking ZAP-70 expression. Moreover, other elements of the pre-TCR/TCR signaling pathway, like LAT and Lck, were also found in B-ALL cells. CONCLUSIONS: Among normal B-cell subsets, ZAP-70 was found expressed in normal pro/pre B cells but not in a significant proportion of normal B cells with mature phenotype. Moreover, the presence of ZAP-70 in B-ALLs probably reflects their cellular origin. The lack of ZAP-70 expression in normal mature B cells suggests that its expression in mature-derived neoplasms with different cellular origin, such as Burkitt's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, might be due to an aberrant phenomenon.
