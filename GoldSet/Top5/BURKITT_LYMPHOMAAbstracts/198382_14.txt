Complement (C3) receptors, EBV receptors, Fc receptors, membrane IgM and beta2microglobulin (beta 2m) were individually stripped from the surface of human B lymphoma lines. The cells were subsequently tested for their ability to absorb infectious EB virus. Stripping of Fc receptors, IgM and beta2m did not reduce EBV absorption. Stripping of either EBV receptors or C3 receptors eliminated or drastically reduced EBV-absorptive capacity. The results confirm the distinctive association between EBV receptors and C3 receptors on human lymphoma cells.
