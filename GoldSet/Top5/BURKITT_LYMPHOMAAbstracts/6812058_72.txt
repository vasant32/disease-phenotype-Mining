The genes for human immunoglobulin kappa light chains have been localized in normal lymphocyte and fibroblast chromosomes by in situ hybridization of probes from cloned DNA fragments of the kappa variable region locus. The localization was achieved by counting grains (after autoradiography) over chromosomes in a number of karyotypes. The variable region gene probes hybridized in a cluster on a region of the chromosome 2 short arm close to the centromere (2cen leads to p12). This location was confirmed in lymphocytes from a balanced translocation carrier 46XXt (2; 16) (q13; q22). Our results show that human kappa light chain genes are located in the region of the break point observed in specific chromosomal translocations associated with Burkitt lymphoma.
