Peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy, Epstein-Barr virus (EB-virus)-seropositive donors and from patients with acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria were tested for their cytotoxicity towards autologous EB-virus-infected B-cells using an in vitro regression assay. Of the 18 cultures from control donors, 88.8% showed the normal pattern of regression. Of the 20 malaria patients in the study, 40% failed to exhibit the normal pattern observed in the control group. Analysis of the lymphocyte subsets showed a high incidence of inverted CD4:CD8 ratios in the patient group due to an absolute rise in the CD8 population. This data suggests that the immunosuppressive effects of acute malaria extend to defective control over EB-virus. The relevance of the observations to the aetiology of EB-virus-associated, endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (eBL) is discussed.
