Among non-Hodgkin's lymphomas occurring in childhood two major histologic subgroups can be identified: (1) Burkitt's lymphoma and (2) T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, an uncommon high-grade malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Although Burkitt's lymphoma with maxillofacial involvement is a well-documented disease, T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma in the perioral region is rare. An unusual case of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma with initial oral manifestation in an 18-month-old child is presented.
