We previously identified a novel p53-induced mouse gene, wig-1, that encodes a 290 amino acid zinc finger protein (Varmeh-Ziaie et al., 1997). Here we have identified and characterized the human homolog of mouse wig-1. The human wig-1 protein is 87% identical to the mouse protein and contains three zinc finger domains and a putative nuclear localization signal. Human wig-1 mRNA and protein is induced following activation of wild type p53 expression in our BL41-ts p53 Burkitt lymphoma cells. Wig-1 is also induced in MCF7 cells following treatment with the DNA-damaging agent mitomycin C. Northern blotting detected low levels of wig-1 mRNA in normal human tissues. Fluorescence in situ hybridization mapped wig-1 to human chromosome 3q26.3-27. FLAG-tagged human wig-1 localizes to the nucleus. Ectopic overexpression of human wig-1 inhibits tumor cell growth in a colony formation assay. These results suggest that human wig-1 has a role in the p53-dependent growth regulatory pathway.
