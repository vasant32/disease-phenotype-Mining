The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathway is involved in various malignancies, but the role of PI3-K/Akt pathway in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infected Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells remains unclear. To elucidate therapeutic targets for BL, this study investigates the effect of PI3-K/Akt pathway in: EBV-positive BL cell lines Raji, P3HR-1, Akata and Daudi; and EBV-negative BL cell lines Ramos and BJAB. Results of analyses indicate that Akt was constitutively phosphorylated in BJAB, P3HR-1, Akata, and Daudi but not in Ramos and Raji cells. We characterized Akt phosphorylation on cell growth and EBV lytic cycle in P3HR-1 cells, which were phosphorylated most intensively. The Akt was equally phosphorylated in cells cultured with and without fetal bovine serum for a few days. Akt phosphorylation and cell growth were inhibited by PI3-K specific inhibitor LY294002 in a dose-dependent manner. LY294002 markedly down regulated expression of EBV lytic gene BRLF1 protein Rta, BMRF1 protein EA-D, but not BZLF1 protein ZEBRA. The inhibitor reduced viral capsid antigen (VCA) positive cells. Down regulation of Rta by LY294002 occurred at the transcriptional level. These results demonstrate that PI3-K/Akt pathway is activated constitutively in P3HR-1 cells; it promotes cell growth and the lytic cycle cascade downstream of ZEBRA.
