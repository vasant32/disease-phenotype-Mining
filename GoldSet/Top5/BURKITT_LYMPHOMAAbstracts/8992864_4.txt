Kabuki make-up syndrome was first reported in 1981 and is characterized by peculiar facies with post natal growth deficiency and mental retardation. Since the first report, approximately 100 cases have been reported, but there have been no reports of tumor development. A case is reported of a patient with Kabuki make-up syndrome who developed malignant lymphoma in his abdomen at the age of 3 years. The tumor was histologically diagnosed as Burkitt's lymphoma and Epstein-Barr virus was detected by in situ hybridization.
