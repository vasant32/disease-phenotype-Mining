Paraneoplastic syndromes are rare in paediatric oncology. This report describes a four-year-old Cantonese child whose sole presenting symptom was acrocyanosis who was found to have Burkitt's lymphoma in association with the presence of positive antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antiendothelial antibodies and elevated serum immunoglobulin G concentrations. Digital ischaemia has not been described as a presenting symptom of Burkitt's lymphoma, although this association has been reported in 25 patients with other malignancies.
