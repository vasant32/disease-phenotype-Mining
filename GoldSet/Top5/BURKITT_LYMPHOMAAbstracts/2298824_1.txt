A nonmalignant near-diploid cell line m5s/1M, established by Sasaki and Kodama (J. Cell. Res., 131:114-122, 1987), was shown to respond to the epidermal growth factor (EGF). The m5s/1M cells showed high sensitivity to post-confluence inhibition of cell division and formed a uniform monolayer after the cells had become confluent. The addition of EGF resulted in loss of contact-dependent inhibition of growth and caused a massive piling up of a multilayered array of cells after they had become confluent. When EGF was removed from the medium, the cell number decreased rapidly, and the cells formed a uniform monolayer at the density observed in the absence of EGF. m5S/1M cells have high- and low-affinity receptors for EGF (approximately 40,000 receptors per cell), and the apparent dissociation constants of the EGF-binding reactions were 3.3 nM and 0.15 nM, respectively. The effect of EGF on the intracellular mobilization of Ca2+ and the formation of inositol phosphates was studied by using the calcium-sensitive fluorescent indicator fura 2 and [3H]inositol. EGF had no effect either on the mobilization of cytosolic free calcium [( Ca2+]i) or on the formation of inositol phosphates in m5s/1M cells, whereas bradykinin induced a rapid increase in both [Ca2+]i and inositol phosphates. Analysis of the glycosphingolipid (GSL) composition of m5S/1M cells showed that globotriaosylceramide (Gb3Cer), which is known to be a Burkitt lymphoma-associated antigen, is specifically expressed in the EGF-treated cells. The expression of Gb3Cer is dependent on the presence of EGF, with a reversible shift in GSL composition being observed in the presence or absence of EGF.
