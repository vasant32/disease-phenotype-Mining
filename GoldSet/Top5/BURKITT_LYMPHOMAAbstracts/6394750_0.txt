During the evaluation of a Burkitt lymphoma, a diffuse uptake of 99mTC MDP in the lungs and gastric mucosa, discovered by bone scintigram, allows the detection of metastatic calcifications. Bone scintigram appears to be an useful tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of these calcifications. The echographic pattern of the gastric involvement with both thick wall and mucosal calcifications, is reported.
