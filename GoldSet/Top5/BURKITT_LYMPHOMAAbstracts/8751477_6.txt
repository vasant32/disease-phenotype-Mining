We have recently established a new Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line, designated Z-33. This line has L2 morphology, ultrastructural characteristics of lymphoblasts and typical B lineage surface markers identical to those observed in the Ph1-positive ALL patient from whom the line was derived. In addition, a rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (JH) band was found in Z-33 cells by Southern blot analysis, confirming B cell clonality. Cytogenetic analysis of the cell line revealed t(9;22)(q34;q11.2). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified cDNA from Z-33 cells demonstrated an e1-az BCR-ABL junction, and the p190BCR-ABL protein was detected in them by the immune complex kinase assay. Z-33 cells produce interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, Neither IL-1 beta, G-CSF, TNF-alpha, nor their corresponding antibodies affected the cell line's growth. In contrast, anti-GM-CSF neutralizing antibodies suppressed Z-33 colony formation, and GM-CSF stimulated it in a dose-dependent fashion. In addition, receptor studies with biotinylated GM-CSF demonstrated specific binding to Z-33 cells, indicating that the cells express GM-CSF receptors. Taken together, our data suggest that the Ph1-positive Z-33 ALL cells produce GM-CSF, express GM-CSF receptors, and show an autocrine proliferative response to this cytokine.
