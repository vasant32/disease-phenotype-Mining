Eliminating Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes from infected cells is an intriguing theoretical strategy in therapy for EBV-associated malignant diseases. Respective patterns were characterized for hydroxyurea (HU)-promoted loss of EBV genomes from EBV-infected epithelioid cell lines derived from the noncancerous portion of gastric carcinoma tissues and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines. Epithelioid cell lines GT38 and PN were less sensitivity to HU than BL cell lines Akata, Raji, and Daudi in terms of cell growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest. On passage in medium with 50 microM HU, the fraction of EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA)-positive cells was reduced substantially in the BL cell lines, but only slightly in the epithelioid cell lines. EBV DNA was reduced in Akata, Raji, and Daudi cells upon passage in 50 microM HU by 95%, 70%, and 50%, respectively, but by only 10% in GT38 cells, in which EBV DNA reduction was enhanced at increased concentrations of HU. This indicates that EBV genome is more easily lost from BL cell lines than from epithelioid cell lines upon culturing in HU. These findings support the view that the elimination of EBV could be therapeutically effective in EBV-associated BL by HU.
