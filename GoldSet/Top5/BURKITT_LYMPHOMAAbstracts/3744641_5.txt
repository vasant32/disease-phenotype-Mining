The intermediary metabolism of pyrimidine nucleosides was studied in a line of human B lymphoblasts (Raji) in which pyrimidine de novo synthesis deficiency was pharmacologically induced by pyrazofurin. It was found that Raji cells are cytidine deaminase deficient that cytidine has a synergistic effect on the toxicity of pyrazofurin towards these cytidine deaminase deficient cells, affecting both the proliferation and the viability of the cells. Indirect evidences suggest that this synergistic toxicity is not mediated by an effect on nucleoside diphosphate reductase nor on the first steps of pyrimidine de novo synthesis.
