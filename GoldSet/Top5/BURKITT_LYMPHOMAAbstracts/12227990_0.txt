Imaging is often vital in the diagnosis and staging of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with regard to infections and malignancies. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is an AIDS-defining illness and a common AIDS-related malignancy. These lymphomas are usually high-grade immunoblastic, primary central nervous system (CNS) or Burkitt's, and occasionally Hodgkin's. In Europe and North America, Burkitt's lymphoma occurs vastly more often in AIDS. Images of three widely varied cases of AIDS-related Burkitt's lymphoma reflect its radiologic features.
