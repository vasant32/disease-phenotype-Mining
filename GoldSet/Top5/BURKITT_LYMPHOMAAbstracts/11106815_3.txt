We report a case of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the simultaneous occurrence of a t(2;8)(p12;q24) typically associated with mature B cell or Burkitt leukemia, and a t(12;21)(p13;q22) exclusively associated with pre-B cell ALL. The lymphoblasts were characterized as L2 morphology by the French-American-British classification. However, there were atypical morphologic findings for L2 ALL, including vacuolization in some cells. The lymphoblasts were periodic acid-Schiff positive and myeloperoxidase negative. Immunophenotypic analysis revealed that the majority of lymphoblasts were TdT+, CD10+, CD19+, CD20-, and cytoplasmic mu+. These features were consistent with an immature pre-B cell leukemia phenotype with some characteristics of a mature B-cell leukemia. A t(2;8)(p12;q24)(p12;q24), characteristic of mature B-cell leukemia or Burkitt type leukemia, was detected by conventional cytogenetics with no other cytogenetic abnormalities. However, diagnostic peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens demonstrated simultaneous occurrence of a cryptic t(12;21)(p13;q22) by both FISH and RT-PCR. The simultaneous occurrence of these translocations in a pediatric patient have implications for the pathogenesis of leukemias with t(2;8)(p12;q24) as well as t(12;21)(p12;q22). Analysis of additional cases of leukemia with translocations involving the MYC locus on 8q24 will be required to determine the frequency of association with the cryptic t(12;21)(p13;22), and the prognostic significance of the simultaneous occurrence of the translocations.
