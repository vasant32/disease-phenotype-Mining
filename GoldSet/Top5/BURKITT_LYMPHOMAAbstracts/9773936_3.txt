A 54-year-old man with primary gastric Burkitt's lymphoma is described. He was evaluated for appetite loss and intermittent midepigastric pain. Upper gastroduodenal endoscopy detected an ulcer in the lesser curvature of the body, and biopsy specimens revealed infiltration of medium-sized lymphoblasts with "starry sky" macrophages. The infiltrated cells were positive for a B-cell marker. Abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated marked enlargement of the gastric wall, but no enlargement of lymph nodes. These findings led us to diagnose primary gastric Burkitt's lymphoma. The patient responded dramatically to CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy, but 6 months after his initial admission, the disease recurred in the stomach and bone marrow. Lymphoblastic cells were positive for B-cell markers (CD 10, 19, 20, and human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-DR) and showed an abnormal karyotype, 47, XY, t(8;14)(q24;q32), +12. In these cells, the Epstein-Barr virus genome was detected by polymerase chain reaction. Southern blot analysis revealed rearrangement of Ig heavy and light chain genes. In addition, c-myc gene rearrangement was detected. Eight months after the beginning of chemotherapy, the patient died of central nervous system involvement. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a genetic analysis of primary gastric Burkitt's lymphoma.
