The phenotypic and molecular genetic characteristics of 4 variant sublines of the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Namalwa have been examined. The sublines are DNA-fingerprint-identical and derived from a monoclonal tumour, as shown by a rearrangement of the T-cell-receptor beta-chain gene common to the 4 sublines. There is non-co-ordinate expression of MHC class-I MHC class-II, surface immunoglobulin and a number of antigens recognized by CD MAbs on the different sublines. These different phenotypes of the cells are reminiscent of B cells arrested in varying states of cellular maturity. On Southern blots there are different patterns of restriction fragments hybridizing with Ig heavy- and light-chain gene probes among the sublines, indicating that multiple rearrangements or mutations of Ig genes have occurred in the cells. Different patterns of hybridizing fragments among the sublines were also found by using c-myc probes, implying the existence of different mutations of the c-myc locus. The c-myc mutation found in one of the sublines mapped to the 5' flanking sequence and in another 3' to the c-myc locus. Using the J17BS8 probe, which detects a restriction fragment length polymorphism in the 3' flanking region of the c-myc gene, a 4-fold variation in the gene copy number among the subline was found and one of the sublines was shown to be hemizygous for c-myc. Examination of DNA from early cultures of Namalwa cells showed that the alternations in Ig and c-myc structure had occurred on prolonged culture of the cells.
