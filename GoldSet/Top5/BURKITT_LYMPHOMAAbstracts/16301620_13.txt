Elicitation of contact sensitivity (CS), a classic example of T cell-mediated immunity, requires Ag-specific IgM Abs to trigger an initiation process. This early process leads to local recruitment of CS-effector T cells after secondary Ag challenge. These Abs are produced by the B-1 subset of B cells within 1 day after primary skin immunization. In this study we report the surprising observation that B-1 cells in the peritoneal cavity are activated as early as 1 h after naive mice are painted with a contact-sensitizing Ag on the skin of the trunk and feet to begin the initiation of CS. B-1 cells in the spleen and draining lymph nodes produce the initiating Abs by 1 day after immunization, when we found increased numbers of Ag-specific IgM Ab-producing cells in these tissues by ELISPOT assay. Importantly, we show that contact-activated peritoneal B-1 cells migrate to these lymphoid tissues and then differentiate into Ag-specific IgM Ab-producing cells, resulting in specific CS-initiating IgM Abs in the serum by 1 day. Furthermore, pertussis toxin, which is known to inhibit signaling via G protein-coupled chemokines, inhibited the migration of contact-activated peritoneal B-1 cells to the lymphoid tissues, probably due to BLR-1 (Burkitt lymphoma receptor-1). These findings indicate that within 1 h after contact skin immunization, B-1 cells in the peritoneal cavity are activated to migrate to the lymphoid tissues by chemokine-dependent mechanisms to produce serum Ag-specific IgM Abs within 1 day after immunization, leading to local recruitment of CS-effector T cells.
