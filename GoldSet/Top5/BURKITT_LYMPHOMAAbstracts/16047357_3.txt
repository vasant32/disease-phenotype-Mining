We report a case of successful treatment of advanced Burkitt lymphoma in a 3-year-old girl with congenitally acquired HIV infection. She was treated with intensive chemotherapy combined with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). She had not received any anti-retroviral therapy and had stage C3 HIV infection on admission. She was treated with modified BFM 90 and remission was achieved. Simultaneously with chemotherapy, HAART with three drugs was carried out, resulting in improvements in HIV parameters. Our report suggests chemotherapy combined with HAART is feasible in children and may favorably change the outcomes in pediatric patients with AIDS-NHL.
