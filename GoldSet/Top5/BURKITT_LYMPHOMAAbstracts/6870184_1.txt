The cause of human cancer is probably multifactorial and the role of viruses is unclear. The study of retroviruses has led to the identification of oncogenes responsible for transformation and tumor induction. Human viruses associated with malignancies include the JC virus (associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) and some adenoviruses. No human malignancies have been associated with the latter group. A number of herpes viruses of lower animals have been associated with malignancies and herpes simplex virus type 2 has been associated with carcinoma of the cervix and vulva. The Epstein-Barr virus has been associated with Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Some circumstantial evidence suggests that cytomegalovirus may be associated with Kaposi's sarcoma among homosexuals. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. The fullfillment of Koch's postulates presents ethical problems regarding man and proving the viral etiology of human malignancy. Social experiments may elucidate some of these questions. An increase in venereal herpes should be associated with an increase in carcinoma of the cervix and use of the HBV vaccine in populations with high incidences of HBV carrier states should decrease the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. The investigation of the retroviruses though not establishing viruses as causing human malignancies at least will improve our understanding of the malignant process.
