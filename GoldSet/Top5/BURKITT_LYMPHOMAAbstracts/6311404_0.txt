Epstein-Barr virus association in nonproducer human lymphoblastoid cell lines can be demonstrated by the presence of the virus genome (nucleic acid hybridization studies) or by the detection of the virus-coded complement-fixing antigen (complement fixation and/or anti-complement immunofluorescent test). This paper describes an enzyme immunoassay for the detection of Epstein-Barr virus complement-fixing antigen and its application to the demonstration of Epstein-Barr virus association in nonproducer lymphoblastoid cell lines. The assay is based on competition for complement between Epstein-Barr complement-fixing antigen and its specific antibody and a probe complex composed of Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase and specific anti-beta-galactosidase antibody. This competitive enzyme immunoassay is a specific and sensitive procedure for detecting Epstein-Barr virus association in nonproducer cell lines, allowing also quantitative estimation of the amount of antigen produced.
