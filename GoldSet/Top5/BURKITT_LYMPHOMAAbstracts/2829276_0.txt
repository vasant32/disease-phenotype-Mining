Serologic reactivity against EBV-infected lines was assayed in patients with AIDS (n = 4) or the AIDS related complex (AIDS-RC) (n = 46) residing in Argentina. Anti-VCA serology was comparable to that of controls. However sera from AIDS and AIDS-RC could induce antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) to EBV-infected cell lines (P3HRIK and Raji). ADCC activity could be recovered in the high molecular weight fractions of AIDS and AIDS-RC sera. ADCC was observed in sera with high levels of PEG precipitable material (PEG-pp) but was unrelated to the presence of complement-fixing immune complexes (Clq-F) or to anti-VCA titers. Fc receptor (FcR) bridging between target cells FcR and effector cells FcR may play a role in the outcome of total ADCC.
