In situ cytogenetic morphology and analysis showed that Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-infected Raji and EBV-producing P3HR-1 cells divide by meiosis and follow the life cycle of malignant cells in vitro. Meiosis was documented by the presence of condensed chromosomes, "o" chromosome, nuclear vlimata (NVs), NV invasion, extrusion of chromosomes, chromosomal transfer, metaphase fusion and aneuploidy. EBV-Raji, EBV-producing P3HR, HIV1-infected MOLT-4 cells (dividing by meiosis) and human spermatozoa (cellular products of meiosis) were highly sensitive to the endogenous inhibitor (CANP-I) of calcium-activated neutral proteinase (CANP). CANP-I-treated virally infected and virus producing cells showed necrosis and disappearance of immunofluorescent viral antigens, documenting the anti-viral action of CANP-I. CANP-I-treated spermatozoa exhibited arrested motility with subsequent necrosis documenting the in vitro spermicidal action of CANP-I. The testis of treated Wistar rats with 0.25 U CANP-I/gr body weight for six days, were devoid of spermatozoa, with pronounced toxicity and exfoliation of spermatocytes and spermatids, indicating the contraceptive action of CANP-I via spermatogenetic arrest. It is concluded that CANP-I is an anti-meiotic agent inhibiting CANP associated with meiosis. Hence CANP-I is a promising agent against various diseases involving meiosis.
