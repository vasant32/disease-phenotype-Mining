The rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes can be used as a marker of cell lineage and clonality. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique using consensus primers for the IgH gene was used for remission and minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis in the follow-up of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of B-cell lineage. Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) was used to distinguish the specific clonal amplicons from the background. The Authors found that, in a series of 22 patients followed-up for 5.3 to 11.1 years, the PCR-SSCP technique could detect at least one rearrangement at initial diagnosis in 21 (95%). All patients who remained in continuous complete remission were PCR-SSCP negative at remission controls. Ten of the 22 patients had one or more bone marrow relapses. The PCR-SSCP method demonstrated MRD in three of them. In 6 of the 7 (86%) of patients with disease recurrence from whom samples were taken within 6 months before a clinically overt relapse, PCR-SSCP became positive. The Authors conclude that PCR-SSCP of a rearrangement marker might have a role as a convenient technique for monitoring emerging relapse. It may also detect unrelated clones or ongoing secondary recombination events during progression. However, PCR-SSCP is not sensitive enough to detect MRD in all patients in whom disease will later recur.
