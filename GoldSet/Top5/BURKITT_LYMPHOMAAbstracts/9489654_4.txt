We report a patient who developed breast masses 17 months after a T cell-depleted partially mismatched related donor (PMRD) bone marrow transplant (BMT) for chronic myeloid leukemia. The patient had severe chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the masses were due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lymphoproliferative disease (LPD). The patient expired from fungal pneumonia after chemotherapy for the EBV-LPD.
