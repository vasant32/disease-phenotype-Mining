RNA-seq provides a rich source of transcriptome information with high qualitative and quantitative value. Here, we provide a pipeline for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq and we apply it to two type I latency cell lines, Mutu I and Akata. This analysis revealed substantial average expression levels of many lytic genes in predominantly latent cell populations. The lytic transcripts BHLF1 and LF3 were expressed at levels greater than those for 98% of all cellular polyadenylated transcripts. Exon junction mapping accurately identified the Qp-derived EBNA1 splicing pattern, lytic gene splicing, and a complex splicing pattern within the BamHI A region.
