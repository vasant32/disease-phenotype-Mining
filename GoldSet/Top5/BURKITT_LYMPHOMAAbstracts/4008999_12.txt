A substrain of Namalwa cells producing a high ratio of beta-interferon (IFN-beta) versus alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) was investigated by constructing a cDNA library after induction with Sendai virus. The library was screened by two synthetic oligonucleotides, one specific for IFN-alpha and one complementary to both IFN-alpha and IFN-beta. Rescreening the library with two full-length cDNAs encoding IFN-alpha and IFN-beta, respectively, revealed that the frequency of the IFN-alpha and IFN-beta clones reflected the activities of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta obtained by functional assays. On the cDNA level, the dominating species was identical with the type of IFN-alpha A or IFN-alpha 2; however, one new type of cDNA also was found that was similar to the previously described IFN-alpha C. Only one type of cDNA was found encoding IFN-beta, although several IFN-beta proteins have been detected in the analyzed cell line.
