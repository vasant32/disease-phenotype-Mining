The t(1;19)(q23;p13) translocation occurs commonly in B-lineage ALL. Previous reports have demonstrated a predominance of cases with expression of cytoplasmic Ig mu (C mu+), and FAB L1/L2 phenotype, a poor prognosis and expression of a fusion transcript involving the E2A and PBX1 genes in C mu+ but not in C mu- cases. Of 38 patients with karyotypically proven t(1;19) (q23;p13) leukaemias, we extensively analysed 18 patients with acute leukaemia including 16 B-lineage ALLs, one T-ALL and one AML M4. The AML was associated with a classic E2A-PBX1 fusion transcript and may represent the human counterpart of the AMLs induced by E2A-PBX1 retroviral infection of murine marrow progenitors. The T-ALL was E2A-PBX1 negative and neither the E2A nor the LYL-1 genes, both situated at chromosome 19 p13, were rearranged. Of the 16 B-lineage ALLs, four had cytological features resembling an 'L3-like' phenotype classically associated with Burkitt's lymphoma, two at diagnosis and relapse and two exclusively at relapse. E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts were detected by RT-PCR in all 13 C mu+ patients and in 2/3 C mu- cases. The 'L3-like' phenotype did not correlate with a particular stage of maturation arrest (one sIg+, one C mu+, one C mu-) or type of E2A-PBX1 transcript, but was associated in all cases with a trisomy 8. Translocation, rearrangement, amplification or over-expression of the c-myc gene was not observed in these cases, demonstrating that the apparent association with trisomy 8 is not due to deregulation of this gene. We therefore show that the E2A-PBX1 transcript, although occurring predominantly in C mu+ pre-B ALL, also occurs in C mu- early pre-B ALL, sIg+ B-ALL and even in AML. These results suggest that the stage of maturation arrest, and indirectly the prognosis, are not solely due to the type of fusion transcript associated with the t(1;19).
