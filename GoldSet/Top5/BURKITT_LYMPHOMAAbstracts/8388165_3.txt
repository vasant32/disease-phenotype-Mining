A 62-year-old man with a cutaneous large-cell (cleaved, noncleaved) lymphoma had multiple facial lesions and two enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Cytogenetic analysis performed on the involved skin and lymph node revealed the following karyotype: 47,XY,inv dup(1)(q11-->q32),+3,t(8;14)(q24;q32). A t(8;14)(q24;q32) translocation is the chromosome anomaly in 75% of Burkitt's lymphomas. Other types of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, however, may show the same translocation, especially large-cell lymphomas. Duplication of material belonging to the long arm of chromosome 1 is the most frequent additional aberration to Burkitt's translocations in Burkitt's lymphoma/leukemia. Trisomy 3 may be seen in both B- and T-cell malignancies, as well as in angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy. Immunogenotyping of malignant cells from a lymph node showed rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy and lambda light chain genes. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology was positive for EBV nuclear antigen and EBV capsular antigen. No integration of EBV DNA in tumor tissue, however, could be detected by polymerase chain reaction. These results may be useful in defining the biologic characteristics of cutaneous B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
