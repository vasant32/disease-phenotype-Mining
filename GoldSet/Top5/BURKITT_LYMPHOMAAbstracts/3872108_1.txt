Opportunistic infections and malignant neoplasms have been described in homosexual men in association with immunologic abnormalities. We observed the development of malignant B-cell lymphomas in two homosexual men who had had a monogamous relationship for two years. Patient 1 had an aggressive, monoclonal, small, noncleaved, non-Burkitt's lymphoma ("undifferentiated lymphoma"), associated with severe immunocompromise. Patient 2 manifested a monoclonal, small, cleaved, follicular center cell lymphoma, with a follicular pattern, two months later. No common acute infection was detected. Staining for Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen in malignant tissue was negative in the second patient. However, the possibility of a transmissible agent as a causative factor cannot be excluded, and further study of similar patients is warranted.
