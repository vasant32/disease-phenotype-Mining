The immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus on 14q32 is known to be involved in translocations that are associated with B-lymphoproliferative disorders, typically Burkitt lymphoma and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Several cytogenetic abnormalities have been described in post-transplant lymphoproliferatve disease (PTLD), some of which include this locus. To our knowledge, we report the first case of translocation t(9;14)(p11-12;q32) in a PTLD that developed after orthoptic liver transplantation.
