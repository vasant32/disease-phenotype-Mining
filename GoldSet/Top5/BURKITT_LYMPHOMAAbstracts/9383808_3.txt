This retrospective study compared the overall survival, the event-free survival, and the timing of chemotherapy in patients with advanced Burkitt lymphoma with and without laparotomy. Thirty-five patients with advanced abdominal Burkitt lymphoma treated at least partially at the Centre Léon Bérard between 1981 and 1992 were included in this study. The diagnosis was obtained by laparotomy (LAP group) in 21 patients (17 stage III, 4 stage IV) and by other methods (non-LAP group) in 14 patients (5 stage III, 9 stage IV). The overall survival (71 and 93%) and the event-free survival (66 and 79%) were similar in the LAP and non-LAP groups, and the relapse rate was five (three local) in the LAP group compared with three (none local) in the non-LAP group. The local complication rate (9 of 21 versus 2 of 14) and the toxic death rate (2 of 21 versus 1 of 14) were slightly higher in the LAP group. Laparotomy also caused delays in therapy and increased the overall hospital stay. The mean interval from diagnosis to the start of the fourth course of chemotherapy was 57 days compared with 48 days and the average hospital stay was 44.4 days compared with 39 days for the LAP and non-LAP groups, respectively. Because advanced Burkitt lymphoma can be diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration, and chemotherapy cures more than 80% of the patients, there is no need for initial surgery, apart from acute emergencies. Furthermore, laparotomy delay chemotherapy and might reduce the survival rate.
