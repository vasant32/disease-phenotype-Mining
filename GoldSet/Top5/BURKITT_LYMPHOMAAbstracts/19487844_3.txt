 PURPOSE: F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is known to be a useful diagnostic tool for staging, restaging, and monitoring therapy for lymphoma. The purpose of this retrospective study is to present a spectrum of FDG PET findings at initial presentation of Burkitt lymphoma and subsequent findings after therapy. METHOD AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed 48 patients with Burkitt lymphoma referred for a total of 160 FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) scans at our institution. We characterized the disease distribution of Burkitt lymphoma in all patients and measured representative FDG activity from initial staging scans. Therapeutic response and disease remission were assessed in patients with PET/CT and clinical follow-up studies. RESULTS: Of the 48 patients diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma, 25 patients had FDG PET/CT scans for initial staging. All untreated lesions of Burkitt lymphoma were highly FDG avid. The mean maximum standardized uptake value of 54 representative lesions is 16.5 (range: 6-54). Twelve patients were immune compromised. The majority of patients had disease localized to the abdomen and the pelvis. Extranodal involvement was identified in more than half of the patients studied. CONCLUSION: The American (or sporadic) form of Burkitt lymphoma presented with intense hypermetabolic lesions when untreated. The information is useful in evaluating post-treatment studies in the absence of a pretreatment scan.
