Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) kills Daudi cells (Human Burkitt Lymphoma), inducing either necrosis or apoptosis without DNA fragmentation. Therefore, we were interested in studying the molecular and ultrastructural events occurring when the nucleus is more accessible and cells are blocked in mitosis, following colchicine treatment. In fact, as early as after 1 h treatment a typical ladder pattern was shown by means of DNA gel electrophoresis. In parallel the quantitative analysis of the different morphological patterns observed gave evidence of an increased percentage of primary necrosis after 6 h treatment, and a higher incidence of cells in late apoptosis as well as in secondary necrosis after 24 h treatment. Our findings show that Daudi cells respond to the combined treatment with an increased formation of micronuclei and nuclear alterations which follow a number of early mitochondrial changes and result in enhanced cell death. These data imply that TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis of Daudi cells can be triggered by mitochondrial changes and is somehow related to microtubule organization.
