Our research concerned the impact of chemotherapy on the haematological and biochemical profiles of patients diagnosed with malignant blood diseases and receiving treatment in Abidjan. The study covered 57 patients, 26 of whom were receiving treatment. Burkitt's lymphoma was the most common type of malignant blood disease encountered (33%). The proportion of men was slightly higher, at 54%, and the average age of patients was 26. Hyperleucocytosis, anaemia and medullar blastosis were the most common blood disorders. The tumours arising from hyperleucocytosis and medullar blastosis caused increases in proteins from inflammatory reaction. The increase was moderate for alpha 1 globulins and haptoglobin and high (at least twice the reference levels) for C Reactive Protein (CRP) and orosomucoid. Full remission was only achieved in the cases of Burkitt's lymphoma, in which the haematological and biochemical parameters reached near-normal levels following treatment. In cases of chronic myeloid leukaemia the treatment lowered the hyperleucocytosis but the high rate of CRP might indicate that the disease was reaching a more acute phase. In the cases of acute leukaemia, chemotherapy did not achieve full remission: the alpha 1 globulins, including orosomucoids, were the most sensitive proteins to treatment. Even though the rate of CRP was lowered, it remained high in all cases of acute leukaemia. Neither haematological nor biochemical data proved superior to the other in monitoring the effectiveness of the treatment or the gradual return of the disease. It would be beneficial to combine them in order to obtain a clearer assessment of the effectiveness of chemotherapy.
