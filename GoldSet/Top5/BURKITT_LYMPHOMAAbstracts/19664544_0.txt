Neither intrathecal methotrexate nor posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome has previously been reported to result in mesial temporal sclerosis. Described here is the case of a boy with no risk factors for mesial temporal sclerosis who presented with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and partial complex seizures 8 days after initiation of intrathecal methotrexate for treatment of Burkitt lymphoma, and who ultimately progressed to intractable temporal lobe epilepsy due to left mesial temporal sclerosis.
