Total spinal anesthesia (TSA) is a rare complication of lumbar epidural anesthesia through inadvertent spinal injection of local anesthetics following an undiagnosed dural breach or spinal placement of the catheter. TSA has rarely been reported in children. TSA occurred during epidural anesthesia in a 7-year-old child undergoing abdominal surgery. Recent previous lumbar punctures and intrathecal chemotherapy for Burkitt's lymphoma at the same level may have facilitated dural breach. Epidural anesthesia should not be attempted at the same intervertebral level as prior recent lumbar punctures.
