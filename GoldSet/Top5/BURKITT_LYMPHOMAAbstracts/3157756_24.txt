A murine monoclonal antibody, termed HeFi-1, was produced after immunization with the L428 Hodgkin's disease tissue culture cell line. HeFi-1 selectively stained only the Reed-Sternberg or Hodgkin's cells in 18 of 18 cases of Hodgkin's disease, including the nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, and lymphocyte-depleted histologic subtypes. HeFi-1 did not stain any cells in normal lung, brain, salivary gland, thyroid, gall bladder, pancreas, liver, testis, breast, endometrium, or kidney. Rare large cells at the edge of the lymphoid follicles were stained in normal tonsil, colon, and hyperplastic thymus. There was no staining of any cells in 14 cases of B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; however, the malignant cells in three of 11 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which appeared to express T cell markers were also stained with HeFi-1. Tissue culture cell lines including the T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia lines MOLT4 and CEM, the histiocytic cell line U-937, and the amniotic cell line WISH were not stained. Seven Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines were stained with HeFi-1, but there was no staining of three EBV+ African Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines or three EBV- American Burkitt's cell lines. HeFi-1 did not block the ability of the L428 cells to stimulate a mixed lymphocyte reaction or function as accessory cells for mitogen-induced human T cell proliferative responses. Modulation of the HeFi-1 cell surface antigen on the L428 cells was not observed. HeFi-1 specifically immunoprecipitated a cell surface protein of approximately 120,000 daltons from both the L428 and EBV+ lymphoblastoid cell lines. HeFi-1 monoclonal antibody should prove useful not only in the diagnosis, staging, and potential therapy of Hodgkin's disease, but also for determining the cell of origin of the Reed-Sternberg cell.
