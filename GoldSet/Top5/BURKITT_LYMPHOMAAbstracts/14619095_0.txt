A 39-year-old man was admitted to our Medical Department, because of regular abdominal cramps. At physical examination a palpable mass was detected in the ileocoecal region with tenderness. Examinations proved ileocoecal intussusception. Emergency operation was performed. At histology the cause of small-bowel invagination was Burkitt-lymphoma. After the complex haematological examination chemotherapy was started. Six month after surgery the patient is symptomless.
