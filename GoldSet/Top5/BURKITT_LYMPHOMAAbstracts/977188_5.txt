Velocity sedimentation of uridine-labelled cultures was found to be more reliable than isopycnic sedimentation in detecting oncornavirus production in lymphoid cells. Of 13 cell lines (including six derivea from Burkitt's lymphomas and two from leukaemic leukocytes) only one, the leukaemia-derived, Epstein-Barr virus-producing line QIMR-WIL, showed any activity. The nature of the QIMR-WIL particles was further defined by isolation of uridine-labelled 70S RNA and by the simultaneous assay for reverse transcriptase and 70S RNA, but production of such particles was detected in only three of 10 assays. Pretreatment of cells with 5'-iododeoxyuridine or culture in arginine-free medium did not induce particle production. Syncytia assays using XC cells were negative. Of 13 primary cultures (nine samples of leukaemic leukocytes and four of cord leukocytes) treated with mitogens and subjected to inducing conditions, one (leukocytes from a patient with acute myelogenous leukaemia) showed evidence in successive assays of oncornavirus synthesis. The low and transient yield of oncornavirus-like particles obtained in this work parallels that reported in previous studies of fresh lymphoid cells and primary cultures.
