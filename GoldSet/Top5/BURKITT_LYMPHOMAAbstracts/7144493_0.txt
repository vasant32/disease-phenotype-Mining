The author reviews the most recently published investigations on malaria immunology. They represent an attempt to understand, either by exposure to natural infection, or by experimental inoculation, how man and animals develop their particular immunization against malaria. At present, immunization of man does not seem achievable before a long delay. Selection of antigens with monoclonal antibodies, and genetic engineering techniques would most likely facilitate such an immunization.
