BACKGROUND: Transgenic mice bearing a murine immunoglobulin enhancer/c-myc fusion transgene (Emu-myc) provide a useful model for Burkitt's lymphoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Groups of 12 Emu-myc mice were treated prophylactically for 6 weeks after weaning with anti-c-myc DNA phosphorothioate (20 mg/kg/day), scrambled control DNA, or saline, delivered by micro-osmotic pumps. RESULTS: Half of the mice treated with saline or scrambled control DNA displayed palpable tumors by 8-9 weeks after birth, and 95% of them did so by 16 weeks, but 75% of the mice treated with antisense DNA were still free of tumors at the age of 26 weeks. Antisense therapy ablated MYC antigen in the spleens of tumor-bearing mice. Plasma physiological parameters indicated no acute toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term tumor resistance after anti-c-myc DNA therapy implies induction of a host response. Prophylactic anti-c-myc DNA therapy might prevent lymphoma in asymptomatic individuals displaying c-myc translocations.
