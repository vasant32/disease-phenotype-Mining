Between 1967 and 1977, 48 patients with Hodgkin's disease under 16-years-old were treated with MOPP chemotherapy alone at the Uganda Cancer Institute because radiotherapy facilities are not available. Thirty-eight percent had early stage disease (stages I-IIIA). Prolonged first remissions were achieved in 74% of 42 complete responders. Of 11 patients who relapsed, 5 had prolonged second remissions induced by MOPP. Three patients were lost to follow-up and 15 of the remaining 45 died: 12 of these from progressive Hodgkin's disease, 2 from unrelated causes and 1 from Burkitt's lymphoma after 4 months remission from Hodgkin's disease. Acturial survival for all patients is 67% (75% for stages I-IIIA and 60% for stages IIIB-IV). Treatment complications included Herpes zoster and gynaecomastia. The latter is probably related to gonadal dysfunction. All stages of childhood Hodgkin's disease can be successfully managed with MOPP chemotherapy alone.
