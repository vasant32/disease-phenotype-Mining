The human T leukemia line Jurkat maintains functional characteristics of normal T cells in responding to inducing stimuli by the release of interleukin 2 (IL 2). Presence of a phorbol ester during stimulation eliminated the requirement for specialized accessory cells in the response to cell mitogenic agents such as the lectin concanavalin A or treatment with neuraminidase and galactose oxidase. Antibodies directed against the T cell receptor-associated antigen T3 served as efficient stimuli, especially if aided by agents that cross-link immunoglobulin, indicating that a triggering signal is received by a T cell via aggregation of its antigen receptor complex. A Burkitt lymphoma cell line, Raji, was found to selectively trigger Jurkat cells, suggesting the ability of those cells to respond to certain foreign stimuli. The Jurkat cell line has been instrumental in the purification of IL 2 and cloning of the corresponding gene. Our data suggest it can also serve as a useful model for induction of T cell responses.
