Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are divided into stress-inducible and constitutive types. Generally, HSP70 (stress inducible) and HSC70 (constitutive) are representative of their types, respectively. From the results of immunocytochemical analysis, both HSP70 and HSC70 were constitutively expressed in globotriaosylceramide (Gb3)-expressing Raji cells as well as Gb3-negative K562 cells. Furthermore, the membrane-bound form of HSP70 was present on the surfaces of two cell lines as patch and cap-like structures, and was recovered in the cholesterol rich microdomains (CRM) prepared from them. On the other hand, HSP70 was partially co-localized with Gb3 on the surface of Raji cells. This result suggested that HSP70 was not associated with all of Gb3 molecules but with Gb3 specifically located in the particular environment. The effect of Silurus asotus lectin (SAL), which is one of the rhamnose-binding lectins and specifically binds to Gb3, on the disappearance of membrane-bound HSP70 was dependent on whether Gb3 was present or not. These results suggested that the disappearance of membrane-bound HSP70 was caused by SAL binding to Gb3, that the reduction of membrane-bound HSP70 might result in the decrease in cell volume observed, and that the mechanism of SAL-induced HSP70 expression may differ from that of heat shock in Raji cells.
