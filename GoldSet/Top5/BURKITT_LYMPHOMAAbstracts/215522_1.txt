Infection of cells of the EBV-free human B-lymphoma lines BJAB and Ramos resulted in conversion of these cells to EBV-genome carriers expressing EBNA. EBV isolates from P3HR-1 cells induced a heterogeneous EBNA pattern: both a faintly granular pattern and brilliant EBNA-expression were observed. The two types of EBNA-expressing cells could be separated upon cloning. Brilliantly EBNA-expressing cells always segregated varying percentages of EBNA-negative cells. An EBNA-negative subclone derived from these cells was devoid of detectable EBV DNA. Nucleic acid hybridization experiments failed to reveal a correlation between the intensity of EBNA expression and the number of EBV genome equivalents per cell. EBV genome-containing cells had an average of 14-fold more cells showing EA synthesis after superinfection by P3HR-1 virus, when compared with EBNA-negative cells infected under identical conditions. Studies on the kinetics of EA induction in EBNA-positive and EBNA-negative cells indicate that complementation is required for the induction of EA after superinfection.
