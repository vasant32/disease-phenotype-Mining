The pattern of protein synthesis has been compared in Namalwa cells following treatment with butyrate and 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Although these treatments cause a substantial increase in Sendai virus-induced interferon synthesis (up to 300-fold) we observed no comparable effect on the synthesis of other cellular proteins. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis we have investigated the proteins synthesised before and 8 h after Sendai virus infection of treated cells. Only 2 of the 300 most abundant cellular proteins were reproducibly affected, these always showed increased rates of synthesis in butyrate-treated cells. The most significant was a 3-4-fold enhancement in synthesis of a 35,000 molecular weight protein which we have called BEP35. On individual occasions treatment caused changes in the rates of synthesis of other proteins, these were not reproducible and involved less than 4% of the proteins investigated. None of the Sendai virus structural proteins or virus-induced cellular proteins were affected by the treatment. We conclude that butyrate and BrdUrd treatments have a relatively specific effect on the synthesis of interferon in Namalwa cells, as the majority of protein synthesis remains unaffected.
