The effect of heat-shock on the expression of c-myc genes in different chromosomal contexts was investigated in a panel of human B-lymphoid cell lines. Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines with c-myc translocation breakpoints upstream of the first exon, within the exon itself, or in the first intron showed downregulation of c-myc levels as did a cell line without any translocation. The c-myc mRNA of cell lines with translocation breakpoints within the c-myc gene have previously been reported to have prolonged half-lives. After heat shock, the levels of these mRNA species were reduced with similar kinetics as the normal c-myc mRNA. An exception was an RNA species where the only c-myc sequences are derived from exon 1, showing that sequences from this part of the c-myc gene are not sufficient to mediate the rapid downregulation. Nuclear run-on analysis did not show reduced transcription of c-myc after heat shock and a comparison of cytoplasmic and total RNA did not indicate accumulation of longer, unspliced c-myc mRNA species. These observations suggest a posttranscriptional, cytoplasmic downregulation targeting exons 2 and/or 3. B-lymphoma lines transfected with a hsp70 promoter-linked c-myc gene were deficient in their ability to reinitiate proliferation after heat shock, providing a physiological rationale for the normal downregulation of c-myc after this type of physical stress.
