Leukemic cells can be distinguished from normal hematopoietic cells on the basis of chromosomal or molecular abnormalities, antigen receptor gene rearrangements and immunophenotype. Set of 3-, 4-combination of monoclonal antibodies was used for exact definition of immunophenotypic characteristics of B-cells populations from healthy donors and aberrant, asynchronous, over/under-expressed phenotypes and detection changes in intensity expression of markers that characterized pathological leukemic B-cells at diagnosis. These differences in normal and abnormal cell patterns were very important and could be utilized for analysis of minimal residual disease. On the basis of these findings we were able to clearly distinguish residual leukemic cells from hematogones (healthy B-lymphocyte precursors) too. We also verified that in some cases the CD58 marker is overexpressed on CD10+, CD34+ blast cells at diagnosis and can be feasible used for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD).
