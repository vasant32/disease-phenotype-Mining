The initial radiographs of 51 consecutive, previously untreated children with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were reviewed. The chest radiograph was abnormal in 37%, with pleural effusions seen in 14% of patients. Lymphography, readily performed in children, was positive in 30% of the successful studies. There was a high incidence of bone lesions (18% of patients), due in large part to involvement of the facial bones; all were symptomatic and/or seen on the routine chest and abdominal radiographs. Intrinsic disease of the small bowel (10%) and colon (8%) was also associated with symptoms, so that the value of routine barium studies in asymptomatic children is questioned.
