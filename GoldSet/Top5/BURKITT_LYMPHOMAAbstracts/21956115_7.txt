Most transcription of the MYC proto-oncogene initiates in the near upstream promoter, within which lies the nuclease hypersensitive element (NHE) III(1) region containing the CT-element. This dynamic stretch of DNA can form at least three different topologies: single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA, or higher order secondary structures that silence transcription. In the current report, we identify the ellipticine analog GQC-05 (NSC338258) as a high affinity, potent, and selective stabilizer of the MYC G-quadruplex (G4). In cells, GQC-05 induced cytotoxicity with corresponding decreased MYC mRNA and altered protein binding to the NHE III(1) region, in agreement with a G4 stabilizing compound. We further describe a unique feature of the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line CA46 that allowed us to clearly demonstrate the mechanism and location of action of GQC-05 within this region of DNA and through the G4. Most importantly, these data present, as far as we are aware, the most direct evidence of intracellular G4-mediated control of a particular promoter.
