46 cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome permit the authors to detail the particular aspects of the oral and facial lesions in AIDS. In patients at risk, a lymphadenopathic syndrome is thought to represent a prodromic phase of the illness. The authors insist upon the differences between the classic Kaposi's sarcoma and that associated with the AIDS (mean age and initial sites of tumor). One third of these sarcomas is completed by a digestive candidiasis. The review of the literature reveals squamous cell carcinoma and Burkitt's lymphoma with the AIDS. We must be aware of early diagnosis and transmission factors in the individuals at risk with tumors and opportunistic infection.
