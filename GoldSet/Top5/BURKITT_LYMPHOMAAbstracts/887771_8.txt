Studies of American Burkitt's lymphoma in 12 children showed a high incidence of abdominal involvement, including ileocecal masses with intussusception, retroperitoneal extension, and diffuse bowel involvement. Pleural effusions were common, and 2 patients had pulmonary nodules. Three patients had diffuse renal involvement. The mandibles and other bones were not affected in any of the 9 patients tested. The first 2 patients survived 0.5 to 8.5 months; the last 2 were treated much more aggressively and were still free of disease at the time this paper was written, 14 and 16 months after treatment, respectively. Hopefully, early recognition of the clinical and roentgenographic features of American Burkitt's lymphoma will contribute to improved survival.
