T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia is an uncommon disease, with limited information on karyotypic aberrations. No consistent chromosomal changes have thus far been described. We report two cases of T-LGL leukemia who presented with severe anemia. The LGL were CD3+, CD4-, CD8+, CD56-, and CD161-, with variable expression of CD94, CD158a, and CD158b, and had clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement. A deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 was the sole aberration in both cases. This is the first report of a recurrent chromosomal aberration in T-LGL leukemia.
