A real-time PCR technique was used to quantify EBV DNA load in plasma, leukocytes, peritoneal cells, ascites and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at diagnosis and during the follow-up of a 21-year-old patient suffering from an abdominal form of EBV-associated Burkitt's lymphoma. The EBV DNA load correlated well with the clinical and biological remission status of the patient after chemotherapy confirming that EBV DNA quantitation in plasma and leukocytes from peripheral blood can be considered as a marker of the tumor load and can be analyzed in parallel for monitoring of EBV-related malignancies.
