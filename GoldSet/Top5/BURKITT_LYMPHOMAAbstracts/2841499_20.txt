Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can infect CD4+ lymphocytes, monocytes-macrophages, and various other cell lines, including B-cell lines. To study the parameters of B-cell infections, we examined the susceptibility of 24 B-lymphoid cell lines to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections. These cell lines included a series of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and their EBV-converted counterparts. To infect these cells we used two HIV-1 isolates and one HIV-2 isolate. Infections were monitored with a cytoplasmic RNA dot-blot and a syncytium assay. HIV infection was also studied by a novel method based on electrophoresis of DNA liberated from cells that were lysed in situ in the well of an agarose gel. All human B-cell lines could be infected with HIV-1, regardless of the presence of EBV genomes; thus, EBV infection had no major effect on HIV susceptibility of B-cell lines. Integrated proviral HIV genomes could be detected by Southern blot analysis of DNA extracted from long-term, non-HIV-producing B-cell lines. This study suggests that B-lymphoid cells may serve as reservoirs for latent or persistent HIV infections in vivo, even in the absence of EBV infection.
