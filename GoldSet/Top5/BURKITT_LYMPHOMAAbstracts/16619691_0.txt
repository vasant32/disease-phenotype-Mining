BACKGROUND: Although cyclophosphamide based regimens can produce remission rates approaching 60 to 80% in endemic Burkitts lymphoma, relapses and refractory disease are fairly common in developing countries, due to advanced stage disease and cost-constraints in the implementation of optimal chemotherapeutic protocols. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an affordable, tolerable and targeted approach to chemotherapy for endemic Burkitt's lymphoma as would be desirable in resource poor settings such as Africa. METHOD: We present data and review pertinent literature that indicates that the antiviral agent Zidovudine specifically targets this tumour through a unique and novel mechanism. DATA SOURCE: Our original studies, publications original and review articles searched in Pubmed indexed for Medline. DATA EXTRACTION: A systematic review to identify studies relating to Zidovudine, EBV+ and Burkitt's lymphoma, indicating antiviral agents zidovudine targeting BL in a unique and novel mechanisms. DATA SYNTHESIS: Our data and a qualitative assessment of the relevant literature was undertaken, given the heterogenicity of the study types making it inappropriate to pool results across studies. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that the incorporation of Zidovudine into Burkitt's regimens may enhance tumour kill and abbreviate the duration of treatment necessary for this disease. Furthermore, the addition of the widely available and inexpensive agent hydroxyurea, markedly potentiates the tumorcidal activity of Zidovudine in Epstein Barr virus positive Burkitt's lymphomas. We recommend that further clinical studies in patients afflicted with this disease are needed to clearly define this potential use of Zidovudine.
