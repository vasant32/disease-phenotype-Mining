Described herein is a case of childhood Burkitt's lymphoma initially presenting as a pericardial effusion. A cytological diagnosis was made from a Wright's-Giemsa stained cytospin preparation. Supporting diagnostic evidence was provided by immunological surface marker analysis and electron microscopy. To our knowledge, Burkitt's lymphoma has not hitherto been diagnosed initially from the morphology of cells in pericardial fluid.
