Spontaneous rosette formation was observed in eight out of nine Burkitt lymphoma biopsies. These were examined fresh and/or after culture in vitro for up to 48 h. The percentage of rosettes varied from 3.7% to 38%. There was a tendency for the percentage of rosettes to increase with time in tissue culture. It is suggested that the rosette-forming cells are T-lymphocytes infiltrating the tumour and functioning as a host defence mechanism against the proliferating tumour cells.
