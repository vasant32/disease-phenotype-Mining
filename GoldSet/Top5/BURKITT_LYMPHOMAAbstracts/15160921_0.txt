A human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-derived cell line, BALM-25, was established from the bone marrow specimen of a 59-year-old male patient with B-cell ALL L3 type (ALL-L3) at diagnosis. Immunophenotyping indicated mature B-cell characteristics including expression of cell surface and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (Ig) chains, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD38, CD39, CD40, CD71, NU-B1 and HLA class II. T-cell and myeloid associated antigens tested were negative except CD5. BALM-25 cells have a morphological appearance typical for L3-type lymphoblasts. Regarding the expression of Ig chains, while the original leukemia cells expressed Ig lambda delta mu and hence a single light (L) chain isotype, the established line revealed double L chain expression both at the cell surface and the cytoplasmic level. Definitive double L chain expression was confirmed by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. Southern blot analysis demonstrated rearrangement of the IgJH, the Ckappa and the Clambda genes. Cytogenetic analysis of BALM-25 revealed the following numerical and structural abnormalities: 55, X, add(X)(q12), + 2, add(3)(p21), + 5, add(7)(p13), add(11)(p11.2), add(11)(q?23), add(12)(p11.2), add(14)(q22), - 15, + 16, + 16,add(18)(11.2), + 20, + marl, + mar2, + mar3, + mar,inc. The established cell line, BALM-25, provides an unlimited supply of cell material for analyzing the unique (patho)physiology of Ig expression in general and for clarifying the pathogenesis of this type of B-cell malignancy in particular.
