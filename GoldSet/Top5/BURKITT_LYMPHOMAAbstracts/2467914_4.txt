Human alpha or beta interferons inhibit the proliferation of Daudi Burkitt lymphoma cells and induce the differentiation of these cells towards a mature plasma cell phenotype. Similar responses are seen when Daudi cells are treated with the phorbol ester, TPA. Both interferons and TPA down-regulate expression of the c-myc oncogene in these cells. Although TPA can mimic the effect of interferon on cell differentiation, it does not induce 2'5' oligoadenylate synthetase or the interferon-sensitive mRNAs, 6-16 or 9-27. Thus chronic stimulation of protein kinase C by TPA cannot mimic all of the effects of interferon treatment on gene expression. Inhibition of ADP-ribosyl transferase activity by 3-methoxybenzamide impairs interferon- or TPA-induced differentiation of Daudi cells. This agent induces a higher level of c-myc mRNA in the cells and stimulates the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA; although these effects are partially counteracted by interferon or TPA treatment, the elevated expression of the c-myc gene may be sufficient to prevent terminal differentiation and allow cell proliferation to continue.
