The expression of neutral glycosphingolipids (GSL) in 37 B-cell neoplasms [7 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 5 Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), 7 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 5 diffuse, poorly differentiated lymphoma (DPDL), 6 diffuse histiocytic lymphoma (DHL), 3 hairy-cell leukemia (HCL), and 4 multiple myeloma (MM)] was examined. Patterns of expression of simple (GlcCer, LacCer) and globo-series GSL (Gb3, Gb4) were found for each tumor type. In addition, pre-B ALL expressed the neo-lacto series GSL, paragloboside, which was not significantly seen at later stages of maturation. As a group, leukemias expressed about 10 times higher ratios of simple GSL to Globo-series GSL as compared to lymphomas, regardless of stage of differentiation. Significant amounts of GSL of other series were not found except in one CLL which contained asialo-GM2. GSL phenotype in these cells was not grossly affected by cell genotype since pre-B ALL containing Philadelphia chromosome t(9q;22q) translocations were similar to other ALL; and DHL with t(8q;14q) translocations had GSL patterns similar to other DHL samples and dissimilar to GSL patterns found in Burkitt's lymphomas with t(8q;14q). Differences in GSL expression among the different types of B-cell neoplasm suggested that GSL patterns form a phenotypic map that may complement the traditional glycoprotein immunophenotypic map and contribute to our understanding of the biology of these diseases and B-cell differentiation.
