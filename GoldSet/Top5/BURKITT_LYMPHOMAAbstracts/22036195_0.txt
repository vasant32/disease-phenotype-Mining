Following the observation that dopaminergic components are present in normal and malignant B cells, we now provide evidence that they additionally express the functionally related trace amine-associated receptor-1 (TAAR1). Immunodetectable TAAR1 was found in lines derived from a broad range of B-cell malignancy; and in tonsillar B cells, particularly when activated. L3055 Burkitt's lymphoma cells were shown to respond to prototypical TAAR1 agonists in cytotoxicity assays with features of apoptotic death evident; normal B cells were somewhat less sensitive to the agonists. These data raise the possibility that TAAR1 may have therapeutic relevance to leukemia, lymphoma, and wider B-cell pathologies.
