The Epstein-Barr virus has been implicated in the etiology of endemic Burkitt's lymphoma, post-transplant lymphoma, large-cell anaplastic CD30 (Ki-1)-positive lymphoma, and in many T-cell lymphomas. A recent report has found Epstein-Barr virus genome in association with 4 of 11 cases (36%) of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. In a retrospective study, we have characterized 22 consecutive cases of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma from the West of Ireland where celiac disease is endemic. All cases were immunophenotyped with T- and B-cell markers including the anaplastic large-cell lymphoma marker CD30 or Ki-1. Nineteen cases were studied for latent membrane protein expression and 16 for Epstein-Barr virus small RNAs by in situ hybridization using EBER oligonucleotides on routinely processed sections. Only 1 of 16 cases (6%) showed Epstein-Barr virus in tumor cells and no cases stained with latent membrane protein. Eight of 22 cases (36%) including the EBER-positive case were positive for CD30. These results suggest that the Epstein-Barr virus does not commonly play a role in the pathogenesis of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma from this area.
