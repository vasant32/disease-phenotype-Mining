Plasmablastic lymphoma is a rare variant of a diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma, which typically presents in the oral cavity in immunocompromised patients. In HIV positive patients, this tumor has a tendency to manifest in extramedullary sites. In this report, we document a rare instance in which this neoplasm besides affecting the bone marrow also involved the lung. In addition, the lymphoma in our case disclosed CD10 positivity on immunohistochemistry and t(8;14)(q24;q34) translocation on cytogenetic analysis, mimicking a Burkitt/atypical Burkitt lymphoma. The problems in diagnosis are discussed.
