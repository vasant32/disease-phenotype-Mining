Monoclonal antibodies were raised against a laboratory derived variant of the Raji Burkitt lymphoma cell line. We have characterized two of these antibodies by screening on haematopoietic cell lines, and frozen sections of both reactive and neoplastic lymphoid tissue, and found reactivity with separate cellular components of lymphoid follicles. Monoclonal FW37.4.D5 reacts in section specifically with follicular dendritic reticular cells. Monoclonal 35.1C5 reacts with a subpopulation of splenic marginal zone, and lymph node mantle zone, B lymphocytes, but stains only rare cells within germinal centres. This monoclonal is operationally B lymphocyte specific, distinguishing an 'intermediate' B cell subset, represented in lymphoma by B chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, B hairy cell leukaemia and centrocytic lymphoma.
