Acute tumor lysis syndrome (ATLS), a condition which results from a rapid destruction of tumor cells with massive release of cellular breakdown products, has been well described. However, only a few cases of spontaneous ATLS have been reported in the literature. Acute renal failure (ARF) from spontaneous ATLS has been reported only in three patients who were diagnosed to have Burkitt's lymphoma, adenocarcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. We report a similar case of a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, who developed ARF from spontaneous ATLS. ARF can complicate the clinical course of spontaneous ATLS. Since only one patient survived, patients who develop ARF from spontaneous ATLS have a poor outcome. This paper illustrates the need to anticipate the development of ARF, despite aggressive therapy, in a patient with spontaneous ATLS. Prospective studies on renal function prior to and during therapy are required in order to develop a clinical profile reliably detecting patients at risk for developing renal failure and subsequent complication.
