Three children with malignancies developed severe neurotoxicity, including transient cortical blindness, following chemotherapy regimens. The only drug in common was vincristine sulfate. The clinical courses of these patient are described. All have completely recovered, although one child who was rechallenged with vincristine had a cardiorespiratory arrest, increasing neurotoxicity, and recurrence of blindness. Transient cortical blindness has not previously been attributed to vincristine sulfate therapy, but must be considered as a possible complication of treatment with this agent.
