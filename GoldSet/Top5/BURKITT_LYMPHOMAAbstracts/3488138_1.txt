N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity and isoenzyme profiles were studied in myeloid, histiocytic, B-lymphoid, T-lymphoid and lymphoblastoid continuous cell lines in order to determine if N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase isoenzyme expression may help to distinguish among various types of leukemic proliferation. Total NAG activity in myeloid, histiocytic, erythroleukemic cell lines were higher than Burkitt's lymphoma derived cell lines (B-lymphoid), T- or lymphoblastoid cell lines. On chromatofocusing by PBE 94 coupled with an automated enzyme assay an intermediate (I) beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase form, eluting between forms B and A, was found in all leukemic and in Epstein-Barr virus infected lymphoblastoid cell lines analysed. The different profiles recorded, the expression of the I form and the different I/B ratios may be useful as markers of tumour proliferation.
