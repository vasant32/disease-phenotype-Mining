 BACKGROUND: To evaluate the prognostic implications of the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) during the induction period in children diagnosed with low risk B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (LR-ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 36 children with LR-ALL treated with BFM-86 protocol, MRD was studied at the end of induction by IgH and TCR delta gene analysis. RESULTS: The probabilities of disease free survival were: 52% (patients with MRD at the end of Induction), 64% (patients with MRD at day 15) and 100% (patients without MRD). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of MRD is a new and useful prognostic factor in LR childhood ALL.
