Investigations were carried out on newly synthesized MA, VCA and EA in Daudi cells superinfected with the P3HR-1 strain of EBV and treated with trypsin to remove previously adsorbed MA-positive material from the cell surface. Synthesis of MA, VCA and EA was completely blocked by puromycin. A marked reduction in the frequency of MA-positive cells was observed in the infected cell cultures in the presence of either Ara-C or PA, but a fraction of the MA-positive cells was insensitive to the inhibitors. Differential absorption of an EBV antibody-positive human serum with Ara-C-treated or -untreated infected cells revealed two antigenically different components of MA: early (Ara-C-insensitive) and late (Ara-C-sensitive) MA. Three of five sera from patients with NPC, but none of five sera from normal adults, showed an apparent 'prozone' phenomenon in their reactivity against late but not early MA.
