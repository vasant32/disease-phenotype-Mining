Children presenting with advanced leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma may develop life-threatening complications in the early stages of management. Major metabolic disturbances with encephalopathy, septicaemic shock, pneumonitis, massive haemorrhage, or the physical effects of tumour masses may on occasion warrant intensive therapy. Close liaison between paediatric oncologists, oncological surgeons, and anesthesiologists is essential in establishing admission criteria for such cases and in defining therapeutic end points in the event of multisystem failure. This paper discusses the principles of intensive care management of patients with haematological malignancies by considering two cases who developed the tumour lysis syndrome with respiratory and renal failure. A case associated with metabolic encephalopathy is also described.
