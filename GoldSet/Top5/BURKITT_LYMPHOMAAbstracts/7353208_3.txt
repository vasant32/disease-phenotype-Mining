We present the first reported case of primary lymphoma with a nodular pattern in infancy, accompanied by a detailed histopathological study. The diagnosis is based upon unquestionable histopathological data. Remarkable are the macroscopic findings of the lesion, the very young age of the patient, and the Burkitt's lymphoma-like appearance of the lesion in addition to the nodular pattern. Another case of cutaneous nodular lymphoma in an infant was previously reported by Traggis et al. but without a detailed histopathological description. These two cases, in consideration of the rarity of nodular lymphoma in children, promote speculative considerations, especially in regard to etiology and therapy.
