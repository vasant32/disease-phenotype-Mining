The objective was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a short-term, multi-agent and dose intensive regimen in AIDS patients with Burkitt or Burkitt-like lymphoma (BL/BLL) and to compare its efficacy with that of a conventional regimen. This was a retrospective, multi-center cohort study of all HIV-1-infected patients diagnosed with BL/BLL between 1990 - 2004. Patients were assigned to two different chemotherapy approaches. Group A received a protocol which was adapted from the German multi-center study group for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (GMALL). Group B received a conventional CHOP-based chemotherapy. Fifty-one patients were included in the analysis. In group A (n = 20), significantly more patients achieved complete remission (75% vs 40%, P = 0.02) than in group B (n = 31). One-year survival in group A was 65% compared to 44% in group B (P = 0.17). In a multi-variable Cox regression analysis, treatment according to the GMALL protocol was significantly associated with prolonged survival with a relative hazard rate of 0.13 (95% CI 0.03 - 0.63, P = 0.01). In conclusion, the short and intensive GMALL protocol for B-ALL/NHL is feasible in patients with AIDS-BL/BLL. Outcome may be improved compared to patients treated with CHOP-based regimens. In the era of HAART, more intensive chemotherapy regimens should be considered in patients with highly aggressive lymphomas.
