By means of biological in vitro assay collagenolytic activity of normal peripheral lymphocytes was compared to that of EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines: the EBV-producing P3HR1 cells and the non-productive Raji cells. While normal lymphocytes and Raji cells revealed only traces of activity, significantly increased (p less than 0.001) collagenolytic activity was detected in samples of P3HR1, the cell-free EBV-suspension alone showed no collagenolysis. The described enzymatic activity was fully inhibited by 0-phenanthroline and EDTA indicating collagenase action. As main explanations for the phenomenon we suggest the possibility of viral enzyme induction, increased release of protease and thirdly that EBV carries a gene for synthesis of a collagenase.
