The ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles containing the Epstein-Barr virus-associated small RNAs EBER1 and EBER2 were analyzed to determine their RNA secondary structures and sites of RNA-protein interaction. The secondary structures were probed with nucleases and by chemical modification with single-strand-specific reagents, and the sites of modification or cleavage were mapped by primer extension. These data were used to develop secondary structures for the two RNAs, and likely sites of close RNA-protein contact were identified by comparing modification patterns for naked RNA and RNA in RNP particles. In addition, sites of interaction between each Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA (EBER) and the La antigen were identified by analyzing RNA fragments resistant to digestion by RNase A or T1 after immunoprecipitation by an anti-La serum sample from a lupus patient. Our results confirm earlier findings that the La protein binds to the 3' terminus of each molecule. Possible functions for the EBER RNPs are discussed.
