The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) exerts a dose-dependent effect on Daudi cell proliferation. A low concentration has a slight mitogenic effect but higher concentrations inhibit proliferation. The inhibitory effect is associated with increases in cell size, macromolecular content, and incorporation of precursors into RNA and protein. Cell cycle analysis indicates that TPA at 1-10 nM leads to an apparent accumulation of cells in G2/M phase. However, within this population a significant proportion of cells undergo nuclear division but fail to carry out cytokinesis, giving rise to cells with two or more nuclei. Consistent with this, DNA synthesis continues in cells which cease to divide in the presence of TPA. The ability of the phorbol ester to inhibit proliferation can thus be attributed mainly to an inhibition of cytokinesis rather than DNA replication.
