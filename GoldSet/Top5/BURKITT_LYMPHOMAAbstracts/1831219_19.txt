CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cells comprise a very small subset of TCR-gamma delta+ T cells. CD4+ TCR gamma delta+ T cell clones were established to study the phenotypical and functional characteristics of these cells. Thirty-four CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones were established after sorting CD4+ T cells from a pre-expanded TCR-gamma delta+ T cell population. These clones as well as the CD4- TCR-gamma delta+ T cells from the same donor used V gamma 2 and V delta 2. In a second cloning experiment CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cells were cloned directly from freshly isolated TCR-gamma delta+ T cells using a cloning device coupled to a FACS sorter. Forty-three clones were obtained, which all expressed CD4 and TCR-gamma delta. Eleven of these clones used V delta 1 and three of them coexpressed V gamma 2. The other CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones used both V delta 2 and V gamma 2. CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones expressed CD28 irrespective of the V gamma or V delta usage, and were CD11b negative. Three CD4-CD8+ TCR-gamma delta+ clones expressed CD8 alpha but not CD8 beta and were CD11b positive. CD28 expression among CD4-CD8+ and CD4-CD8- was variable but lower than on CD4+ T cell clones. CD4- TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones using V gamma 2 and V delta 2 specifically lyse the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Daudi and secrete low levels of IFN-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF upon stimulation with Daudi. In contrast, most CD4+ T cell clones that use V gamma 2 and V delta 2 had a very low lytic activity against Daudi cells and secrete high levels of IFN-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF after stimulation with Daudi cells. The NK-sensitive cell line K562 was killed efficiently by the CD4- TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones, but not by CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones, and could not induce cytokine secretion in CD4+ or CD4- T cell clones. CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones, but not the CD4- clones, could provide bystander cognate T cell help for production of IgG, IgM, and IgA in the presence of IL-2 and IgE in the presence of IL-4. Thus, CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cells are similar to CD4+ TCR-alpha beta+ T cells in their abilities to secrete high levels of cytokines and to provide T cell help in antibody production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
