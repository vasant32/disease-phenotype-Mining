We describe an interphase FISH analysis for formol-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections with commercial probes detecting the t(11;14)(q13;q32) in mantle cell lymphoma and the t(8;14)(q24;q32) in Burkitt's lymphoma. Staining of an adjacent section allowed identification of tumoral areas. The cut-off value was evaluated in reactive lymph nodes at 5% for both probes. An incomplete hybridization pattern was found in 18 to 26% of the nuclei but was always lower than the percentages of translocated cells in tumoral regions. A t(11;14) was detected in 4/4 mantle cell lymphomas and a t(8;14) in 2/3 Burkitt's lymphomas. Interphase FISH analysis of fixed-tissue sections is a reliable technique for the direct detection of lymphoma-associated translocations on routine histological material.
