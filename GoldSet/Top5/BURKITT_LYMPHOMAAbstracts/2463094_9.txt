It is known that IL-2 induces lymphocytes to produce interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and this IFN type is particularly efficient in inducing tumor cell resistance to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated lysis. We have investigated the effect of IFN on tumor cell sensitivity to LAK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Pretreatment of the human K562 leukemia and HHMS melanoma with IFN-gamma and the Daudi lymphoma with IFN-alpha caused a significant reduction in sensitivity to lysis by human LAK cells generated in vitro in the presence of human recombinant IL-2 (100 U/ml). The LAK activity was mediated by cells expressing NK cell markers (CD16,NKH1) as well as by cells with T cell markers (CD3, CD5). IFN-treated K562 cells were protected from lysis mediated by all these populations. Supernatants from LAK cultures containing IFN-gamma were able to induce NK and LAK resistance when used to pretreat K562 overnight. Antibodies to IFN-gamma but not to IFN-alpha were able to neutralize this activity. Taken together, these results indicate that the production of IFN-gamma by LAK cells may be of importance in induction of tumor cell resistance to LAK cell-mediated lysis.
