Monoclonal antibodies have provided new promise for patients with B-cell malignancies. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against B-lymphocytes that express CD20; it is used for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Very few data are available regarding the treatment of children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma with rituximab. In this article, we reported three children with primary refractory/relapsed B-cell-non-Hodgkin lymphoma, who were successfully treated with a combination of intensive chemotherapy protocol plus rituximab. In all three of our cases, the patients are still in complete remission. Our aim is to emphasize the importance of use of rituximab in the treatment of childhood B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
