We report on six cases of unrelated UCB transplant in adult patients with hematological malignancies: three chronic myelocytic leukemias and three acute leukemias. Their median age and body weight were respectively: 28 years (range 15.5-40) and 55.5 kg (range 46-90). The cord blood units were from the New York Blood Center. The median number of nuclear cells provided, evaluated before thawing, was 2.1 x 10(7)/kg (range 1 x 10(7)/kg-4.7 x 10(7)/kg). The degree of HLA disparity was 1/6: two patients, 2/6: three patients, 3/6: one patient. The patients received a pretransplant regimen including total body irradiation. They were given graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis which consisted of cyclosporin A and corticosteroids. They were all given a combination of G-CSF and erythropoietin. The median time of white blood cell and platelet reconstitution were respectively 24 days (range 12-43) and 60 days (range 23-90). All the patients had a full chimerism. A grade I acute GVHD was observed in four patients and two patients do not have any GVHD. No chronic GVHD has been observed yet. Three patients died from toxicity. Three patients are alive and well in complete remission at 2 years, 1 year and 11 months post-graft.
