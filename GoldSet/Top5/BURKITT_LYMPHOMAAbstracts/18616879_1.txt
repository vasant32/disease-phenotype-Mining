In this retrospective study, we evaluated 53 patients diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). Patients were admitted to the Pediatric Department of Santa Casa de SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil from August 1988 to September 2006. The male gender was found more frequently in the proportion of three males to one female. At the time of the diagnosis, the mean age was 6 years. The most frequent clinical presentation was abdominal (extra nodal) in 42 (79.2%) cases. The patients were treated with chemotherapy using two different treatment methods, 30 cases until September 1994 with BGLTI -87 and the other 23 until September of 2006 with BGLTI -96. According to Murphy's classification, 90.2% of the patients were diagnosed as stages III and VI showing an advanced disease at time of diagnosis. Using Tissue Microarrays (TMA); we searched for the expression of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) RNA in 50 patients. The presence of EBV using in situ hybridization was found in 33/50 (66%) and there was no association between the presence of the virus in the tumor cells or patient age, as well as the survival rate. There was 74.5% global survival rate until September, 2005 of 12 years and 8 months. The disease free survival rate was 86.5%. The frequency of the EBV association with this neoplasia in Brazil is intermediate between the endemic and sporadic forms of disease.
