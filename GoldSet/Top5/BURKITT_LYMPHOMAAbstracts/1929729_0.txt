We report the case of a child presenting with abdominal Burkitt's lymphoma in whom a relapse presented as orbital and muscle involvement. This clinical feature is extremely rare. Two muscle and one orbital biopsies were necessary to obtain proper diagnosis. A new extension check-up showed bone marrow invasion and normal cerebrospinal fluid. This relapse was successfully treated by conventional chemotherapy and consolidated with high-dose chemotherapy, total body irradiation and autologous bone marrow transplantation. Eighteen months after transplantation, the child may be considered as definitively cured.
