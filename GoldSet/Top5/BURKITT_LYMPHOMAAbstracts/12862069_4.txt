OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency distribution of malignant tumours of childhood aged 0-14 years. DESIGN: A retrospective histopathological review of 541 cases of malignant tumours of childhood. SETTING: Cancer Registry, Department of Histopathology, Muhimbili Medical Centre, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. RESULTS: Malignant tumours of childhood accounted for 11.5% of all malignant tumours recorded in the cancer registry. Commonest malignant tumours were lymphomas (53%), of which 31.4% were Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), 14.9% Hodgkin's disease (HD), and 6.6% Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Others were retinoblastoma (12.9%), carcinoma (9%), nephroblastoma and soft tissue sarcoma each 6.7% and Kaposi's sarcoma (5.9%). Bone, germ cell and nervous system tumours were rare. CONCLUSION: These findings may act as a basis for which further studies on malignant tumours of childhood in Tanzania could be carried out.
