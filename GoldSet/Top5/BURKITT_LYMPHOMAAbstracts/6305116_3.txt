A retrospective analysis was performed of localized extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in the head and neck region treated with irradiation. Histopathologic reevaluation revealed 94 per cent with a diffuse type. The lesions were as a rule locally cured with doses ranging from 30 to 50 Gy. Relapses in localized stage I and II patients were, however, not seldom observed in distant extranodal sites. Gastrointestinal relapse in cases with lesions originally located in Waldeyer's ring was thus frequently observed, and the probability of multiple or systemic involvement should be considered also when the disease is located in the oral cavity or sinus region. The value of systemic examination for staging purposes is discussed.
