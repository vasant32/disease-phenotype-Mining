B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is a relatively rare lymphoproliferative disorder. No specific cytogenetic abnormality has yet been associated with it. The most common translocation reported in patients with this disease is t(11;14)(q13;q32). We describe the case of a patient with B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and a hitherto unreported genetic translocation (8;14)(q24;q32) as the sole genetic abnormality, classically seen in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/Burkitt lymphoma. This patient presented with an asymptomatic leukocytosis and splenomegaly. Her marrow showed lymphoid hyperplasia, with immunophenotyping consistent with prolymphocytic leukemia; however, t(8;14)(q24;q32) was the only cytogenetic aberration with both standard karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis.
