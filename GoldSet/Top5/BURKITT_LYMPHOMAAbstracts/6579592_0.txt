Rapid regression of all symptoms was obtained after moderate chemotherapy in two women aged 69 and 77 years respectively with malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Cervico-facial locations of these tumors are discussed in relation to definition, etiology, geographic factors, genetic markers, and associated immunologic disorders. Diagnosis requires a series of explorations including, obviously as a last resort, exploratory cervicotomy. Other regions may be involved and must be investigated, but lesions not affecting lymph nodes occur in only approximately 2 p. cent of patients with cervico-facial malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (approximately 10 p. cent of all malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphomas). Other localizations include the hard palate, gums, sinuses, and salivary glands. Burkitt's lymphoma represents, on the contrary, 30 p. cent of malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma seen in European children. The different therapeutic modalities available are discussed.
