Determining the presence of MYC gene rearrangements is becoming an increasingly important part of the diagnostic workup in aggressive lymphoma. Cytogenetic MYC alterations aid in differentiating diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) from Burkitt lymphoma. In addition, MYC aberrations are associated with poor prognosis in DLBCL. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and karyotyping are standard tests for detecting MYC aberrations, but these techniques are laborious and expensive. Here, we studied MYC status of 219 DLBCLs and Burkitt lymphomas using fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Overall, 15% of the cases had an MYC break. QRT-PCR analysis of MYC expression showed that 72% of DLBCLs with an MYC break had aberrantly high or low levels of MYC transcript. Excluding the cases with aberrantly low MYC expression, we found a significant positive correlation between levels of MYC transcripts and MYC tumor cells; however, QRT-PCR is not readily applicable as a screening tool. Immunohistochemically, all tumors showed a nuclear staining pattern that was simple to evaluate. The percentage of MYC lymphoma cells correlated closely with MYC rearrangement status. In all, 93% of cases with an MYC break had ≥80% MYC cells, in contrast to 3% of nonrearranged cases (P<0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed ≥70% MYC tumor cells to be the optimal cutoff (sensitivity=100%, specificity=93%). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.992, indicating that immunostaining for Myc protein is an excellent screening test to predict whether an MYC rearrangement is present.
