We have investigated methionine adenosyltransferase activity (MAT) in extracts of a variety of normal and malignant human tissues and cultured cell lines. MAT activity assayed from 17 different cultured cell lines varied to a great extent. Ramos (human, Burkitt's lymphoma) and EL4 (mouse, T cell lymphoma) cells showed MAT activity near 300 pmol/mg per min. Daudi (human, Burkitt's lymphoma) and almost all monolayer cells had MAT activity below 100 pmol/mg per min. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes had MAT activity of 36 pmol/mg per min. The MAT activity of the cell lines can be related to doubling time: cell lines with short doubling times have much higher MAT activity than other cell lines. A large variation in MAT activity in different human tissues was observed. In autopsy samples MAT activity was highest in the brain and in the colon. Malignant tissue samples gave much higher MAT activity than normal tissues. Lung cancer (carcinoma squamocellulare pulmonis) had MAT activity of 30.7 pmol/mg per min, while in normal lung it was 2.4 pmol/mg per min.
