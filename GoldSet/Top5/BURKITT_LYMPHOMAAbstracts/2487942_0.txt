Blasts phenotype was determined in 61 children with the acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Non-T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was diagnosed in 51 children. Stages of blasts differentiation were determined with the aid of monoclonal antibodies set using alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase technique. Blasts in 50 patients belonged to B subpopulation confirmed by the presence of panB CD19 and CD22 antigens. Common antigen was seen in 76.5% of the examined patients with non-T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Cases of non-T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia were divided into 8 subgroups depending on the antigens of B-cells differentiation. An identification of pre-B subgroups of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia indicates heterogenicity of the acute lymphoblastic leukemias in childhood and enables their classification into groups corresponding to the early stages of lymphoblasts maturation.
