Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) is essential for the maintenance of latent EBV plasmids, and is also a transcriptional regulator. Nuclear lamins, components of the nuclear lamina, have also been found in the nucleoplasm. We report here that EBNA-1 coincided with lamin B1 in the nucleoplasm and around the nuclear rim during S-phase by confocal microscopy of cells transfected with EBNA-1 in the absence of EBV plasmids. Lamin B1, which is rarely detected in nuclear soluble fractions, was detected in chromatin and nuclear matrix fractions of the EBNA-1-expressing cells. These observations suggest that EBNA-1 colocalizes with lamin B1 in the subnuclear sites.
