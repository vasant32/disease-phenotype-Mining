The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) abortive producer cell line Daudi may be induced to an incomplete cycle of viral production by chemicals such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and n-butyrate. These chemicals greatly increase expression of the early antigen but not that of viral capsid antigen. DNA from these cells was cleaved with various restriction enzymes specific for the mCG sites. Viral sequences (mostly in an episomal form) were tested for their methylation patterns and compared to the methylation pattern of the producer cell line B95-8. The BamHI C, V, and H EBV DNA fragments appeared to be nonmethylated in B95-8 whether or not induced by TPA. The same fragments were partially methylated in noninduced Daudi cells. Treatment of the latter with TPA and n-butyrate increased the amount of viral DNA per cell, and hypomethylation of some EBV DNA sites occurred in parallel. Transcription changes were noted only at the level of the BamHI H fragment; cytoplasmic RNA molecules specific for this region were detected only after induction.
