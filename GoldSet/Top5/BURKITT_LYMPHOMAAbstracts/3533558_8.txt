A 5-yr experience of massive therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) for Burkitt's lymphoma is reviewed. Thirty courses were given to 28 patients. Three patients were in resistant relapse and all three died before day 54 post ABMT. Thirteen patients were in non-resistant relapse and seven are alive with non-evidence of disease (NED). All three patients grafted in partial remission (PR) are alive NED including two with initial central nervous system (CNS) disease. Nine patients were grafted in 1st complete remission (CR) either because of long delay to achieve CR or as consolidation in those with initial CNS involvement or leukaemia. Three of these nine are alive including 2/3 with a long delay to CR and 1/5 initial CNS. The overall survival NED for the 28 patients is 46%. The median observation time post ABMT, 22 months. Clear indications for ABMT in BL are in our opinion restricted to about 20% of the patients: non-resistant relapses and PR after initial induction therapy. Massive therapy as consolidation of 1st CR after initial CNS involvement and in resistant relapses should still be considered as experimental. In 14 patients whose marrow was purged there is laboratory evidence suggesting that the purging procedures used in this study may have been incomplete. Purging techniques still require perfection at a laboratory level and their rationale should not be judged on the basis of incomplete procedures.
