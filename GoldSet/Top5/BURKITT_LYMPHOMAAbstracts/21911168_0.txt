Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are among the most serious and potentially fatal complications of both stem-cell and solid-organ transplantation. Most monomorphic PTLDs are of B-cell origin and frequently associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in the setting of pharmacological immunosuppression posttransplantation. The majority of monomorphic PTLDs commonly resemble diffuse large B-cell or Burkitt's lymphoma; plasmacytoma-like PTLDs are very rare. We report a case of plasmacytoma-like PTLD arising in the allograft in a 66-year-old male diagnosed 2 months following an orthotopic liver transplant for alcohol-related end-stage liver disease. The liver biopsy revealed marked infiltration of atypical plasma cells with lambda light chain restriction and positivity for EBV by in situ hybridization confirming the diagnosis. Also noted was a remarkable increase of tissue eosinophils. Reduction of immunosuppression led to improvement in his clinical condition, and also resolution of the hepatic lesions and abdominal lymphadenopathy noted on imaging studies. While a few cases of plasmacytoma-like PTLDs have been described in literature, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of early onset plasmacytoma-like PTLD in a liver transplant recipient occurring in the allograft with associated lymphadenopathy having distinct histopathologic features including tissue eosinophilia. Timely recognition of such an entity is critical in order to initiate early and appropriate intervention.
