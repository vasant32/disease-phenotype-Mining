Malignant lymphomas, Burkitt's type, and B-ALL are rarely encountered in adult patients. Rapid initial responses are usually followed by early relapse and death. In a pilot study four adult patients, two presenting with B-ALL, were successfully treated with an aggressive protocol developed by the BFM study group for childhood lymphomas of B-type. Rapid clearance of tumor masses was achieved in all patients; no relapse occurred during an observation period ranging from 19-33 months of complete remission.
