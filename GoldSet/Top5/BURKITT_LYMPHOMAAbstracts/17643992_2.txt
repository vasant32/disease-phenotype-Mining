As a continuation to our previous work concerning antitumor benzimidazoles, we have synthesized series of new derivatives of 2-(1-benzyl-2-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-5-ylimino)-3-(substituted)-thiazolidin-4-one (6a-e), 3-(2-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl)-2-substituted-thiazolidin-4-one (9a-f) and we have studied their inhibitory activity against the Epstein-Barr virus-early antigen (EBV-EA) activation introduced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Compound 6d was found to be significantly active and compounds 5a and 6e were also active.
