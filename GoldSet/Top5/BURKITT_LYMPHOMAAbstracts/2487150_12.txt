Clonal abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 13 were detected in 9 of 54 patients with Burkitt lymphoma-leukemia. All abnormalities involved band 13q34, in three patients as t(1;13). The 13q34 abnormalities are thus the second most frequent secondary chromosomal abnormalities, after those of chromosome I, in these lymphoid proliferations.
