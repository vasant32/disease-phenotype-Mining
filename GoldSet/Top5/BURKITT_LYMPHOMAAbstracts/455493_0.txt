Somatic cell hybrids between human lymphoblastoid cells (Raji) and temperature-sensitive Chinese hamster cells (K12) were selected from monolayer cultures in MEM at 40 degrees C. A total of 21 hybrid clones were isolated and karyotyped. All clones contained a near complete set of Chinese hamster chromosomes and 1 to 5 human chromosomes. Human chromosome 14 present in the hybrid cells of all clones; and was the only human chromosome retained in 10 clones. The presence of human chromosome 14 in hybrids was further confirmed by the demonstration of human nucleoside phosphorylase activity in the hybrid cells. Only one hybrid clone was positive for EBNA, the Epstein-Barr virus antigen present in Raji cells. These findings indicate that human chromosome 14 contains the necessary information for the K12 cells to overcome their G1 defect in the cell cycle and grow at non-permissive temperature. The present study lends strong support to the possibility that different steps in the G1 phase of the cell cycle are controlled by genes located on different chromosomes.
