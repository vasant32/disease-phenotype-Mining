The expression of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor in childhood Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells, and the mitogenic effect of G-CSF on these cells, was studied in a panel of 13 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive and negative BL cell lines derived from nine children. G-CSF receptor mRNA expression was investigated by Northern blot analysis and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Binding of G-CSF to BL cell lines was measured by chemical crosslinking of 125I-G-CSF, and proliferation by thymidine incorporation. Inducibility of the G-CSF receptor was studied by stimulation with interleukin-1 beta, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan A, anti-human IgM, phorbol myristate acetate, calcium ionophore A23187, and by infection in vitro by immortalizing and non-immortalizing strains of EBV. BL cell lines, unstimulated or stimulated by biological reagents or EBV infection, did not bind radioionated G-CSF in crosslinking experiments. No stimulation by recombinant human G-CSF was observed in 3H-thymidine incorporation assays. No G-CSF receptor mRNA was detected by Northern blot analysis or RT-PCR in BL cell lines. It is concluded that G-CSF plays no direct stimulatory role in the growth of these malignant B-cells, making a deleterious influence of G-CSF in the clinical treatment situation unlikely.
