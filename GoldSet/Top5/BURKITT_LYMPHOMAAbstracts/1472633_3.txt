Sera from U.S. patients with SLE, RA, and various malignancies, clinically normal individuals with sero-activity to HIV, AIDS, and from pregnant women were tested for the presence of anti-c-myc antibodies. In an ELISA using recombinant human c-myc protein as the antigen, no difference in mean antibody titer was generally detected in these sera when compared to normal controls. Only three malignancy sera (two myeloid leukemia and only one lymphoma) and two patients with AIDS-related lymphoma exhibited exceedingly higher levels of anti-c-myc antibody. However, significantly elevated anti-c-myc antibody levels were found among 20 patients with African Burkitt's lymphoma (Ghana) and 20 normal Ghanians, thus apparently reflecting an autoimmune phenomenon prevalent in the endemic region. These findings indicated that elevated levels of anti-c-myc antibodies are not a general characteristic of patients with diseases that have been associated with increased expression of c-myc.
