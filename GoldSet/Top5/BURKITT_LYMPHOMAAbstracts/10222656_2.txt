The association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SS) is controversial. Reports suggest there is an increased risk of developing lymphoid malignancy in SS. Among our 425 cases of SS, 17 cases of malignant lymphoma (4%), 16 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and 1 case of Hodgkin's disease were found. We looked for an association between EBV and 14 cases of NHL, 13 cases of B-cell lymphoma, and 1 case of T-cell lymphoma in which tissue specimens were available. Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA in situ hybridization study and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study using primers to detect the Bam HI W fragment of EBV with DNA extracts were positive in 2 NHLs: 1 diffuse, large B-cell-type lymphoma, 1 out of 13 cases (8%) of B-cell lymphoma, and 1 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma with dysproteinemia. In the Bam HI W PCR study of DNA obtained from the labial small salivary glands of 55 cases with SS, 3 cases (5%) were positive. These 3 cases were not associated with malignant lymphoma. Our study revealed that EBV association in SS did not lead to an increased occurrence.
