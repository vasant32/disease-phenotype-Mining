The occurrence of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) following Hodgkin's disease (HD) has not yet been reported. A patient treated for HD by chemotherapy-radiotherapy association developed a BL 6 years later: it was demonstrated by cytological, cytochemical, immunological and cytogenetical--translocation t (8; 14)--characteristics. Our hypothesis is that, in this case, BL may be the consequences of chemotherapy-radiotherapy association.
