There appear to be four primary areas of interest in the application of cytogenetic techniques to the study of malignant lymphomas: (1) the role of cytogenetics in the diagnosis of lymphoma in problem cases, (2) as an aid to the classification of malignant lymphomas, (3) whether specific chromosomal patterns will have prognostic significance for response to therapy or survival, and (4) the role of cytogenetics in staging of malignant lymphomas. A case of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia is reported in which cytogenetic studies demonstrated an aneuploid clone suggesting that cytogenetic abnormalities of lymphoma may precede the diagnostic histopathologic picture. The occurrence of 14q+ marker chromosomes in plasmacytic myeloma, plasma cell leukemia, malignant lymphomas, Burkitt's lymphoma, and ataxia-telangiectasia suggest that a common etiologic or pathogenetic mechanism may be present in some of these disorders. A preliminary pilot study of spleens removed at staging laparotomy for Hdgkin's disease suggests that cytogenetic studies may be able to detect Hodgkin's disease that is not apparent histologically. Further studies are required to provide answers to these areas of interest in cytogenetics in malignant lymphoma.
