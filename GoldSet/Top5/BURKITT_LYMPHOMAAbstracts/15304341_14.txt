In a yeast two-hybrid system screen for Cdc42-interacting proteins, we identified a protein with similarity to the CrkII-binding protein DOCK180. A cDNA clone of this protein, designated DOCK8, encoded a gene-product of 1701 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 190 kDa. Immunofluorescence staining showed that transiently transfected HA-tagged DOCK8, as well as endogenous DOCK8, was present at the cell edges in areas undergoing lamellipodia formation. Transient transfection of a C-terminal fragment of DOCK8 resulted in the formation of vesicular structures. Interestingly, these vesicles also contained filamentous actin. These data suggest an involvement of DOCK8 in processes that affect the organisation of filamentous actin.
