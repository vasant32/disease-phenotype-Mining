Infections with both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and malaria have been implicated as causal factors in the pathogenesis of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). Proposed trials of preventive measures for both infections are receiving serious consideration as possible means of establishing a causal relationship with BL. In this paper we examine certain models for the interaction of EBV and malaria in the induction of BL, and also review the aims of the longitudinal, population-based study being conducted in the West Nile District of Uganda. Given existing knowledge, the outcome of preventive trials, even for the most simple interaction models, is unpredictable and, under certain circumstances, trials of an EBV vaccine could actually increase the incidence of BL. It is suggested that trials of an EBV vaccine at this time would be premature and should be delayed at least until the results from the West Nile prospective study are clear.
