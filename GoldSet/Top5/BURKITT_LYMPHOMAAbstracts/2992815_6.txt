The human cell line K562 was treated with human natural leukocyte interferon (IFN-alpha) and recombinant immune interferon (IFN-gamma). Cell cultures exposed to both types of IFNs displayed a reduced susceptibility to the cytotoxic activity of human PBL (NK activity). While this effect occurred preferentially at high doses of IFN-alpha, as little as 10 U/ml of IFN-gamma caused a marked decrease in susceptibility to NK-cell-mediated lysis. Using a monoclonal antibody against human beta2-microglobulin (beta2M) a low level of specific binding to K562 cells was detected. The binding increased after treatment with IFN-alpha (1.4-fold) and IFN-gamma (1.7-fold). The expression of transferrin receptors (TR) was not changed significantly. A hybrid cell line between K562 and a Burkitt's lymphoma-derived cell line displayed a similar pattern of response to IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma as did K562, when effects on NK susceptibility, beta2M expression, and TR expression were studied. The Burkitt's lymphoma line PUT showed no consistent changes in expression of beta2M and TR. These results demonstrate that IFN-gamma is highly efficient in modulating the NK susceptibility, and the expression of beta2M on K562. The presented data do not support a role for expression of TR as the only property that determines the degree of NK susceptibility, since there was no correlation between NK susceptibility and TR expression among the cell lines tested or when IFN-treated and untreated cells were compared.
