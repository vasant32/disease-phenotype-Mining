Obstructive jaundice is an unusual manifestation of non-Hodgkin lymphomas in children. Although surgical drainage is one of the initial treatment choices in some cases, usually lymphomatous masses rapidly response to chemotherapy and jaundice decreases due to regression of the mass, without any surgical procedure. The authors report the case of a 16-year-old girl who presented with biliary obstruction due to a neoplasm involving the duodenum. Histological examination of the specimen, which was taken from the mass by endoscopic biopsy, revealed Burkitt lymphoma infiltrating the duodenum. Chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide was started immediately. In a few days, jaundice decreased rapidly by the shrinkage of the mass. Neither surgery nor percutaneous drainage were needed. In conclusion, biliary tract obstruction due to non-Hodgkin lymphoma can be effectively treated with chemotherapy alone without any surgical procedure.
