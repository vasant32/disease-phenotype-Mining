Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a potentially fatal complication of solid organ transplantation. The majority of PTLD is of B-cell origin, and 90% are associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LG) is a rare, EBV-associated systemic angiodestructive lymphoproliferative disorder, which has rarely been described in patients with renal transplantation. We report the case of a patient with renal transplantation for SLE, who presented, 9 months after renal transplantation, an EBV-associated LG limited to the intracranial structures that recovered completely after adjustment of her immunosuppressive treatment. Nine years later, she developed a second PTLD disorder with central nervous system initial manifestation. Workup revealed an EBV-positive PTLD Burkitt lymphoma, widely disseminated in most organs. In summary, the reported patient presented two lymphoproliferative disorders (LG and Burkitt's lymphoma), both with initial neurological manifestation, at 9 years interval. With careful reduction of the immunosuppression after the first manifestation and with the use of chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy after the second manifestation, our patient showed complete disappearance of neurologic symptoms and she is clinically well with good kidney function. No recurrence has been observed by radiological imaging until now.
