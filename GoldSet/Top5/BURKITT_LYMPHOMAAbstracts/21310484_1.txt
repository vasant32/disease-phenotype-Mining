Previous studies have shown that 7-b (6-(dodecylamino)-2-(3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)propyl)-1H-benzo-[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione), a novel amonafide-based DNA intercalator, was generated as a new anticancer candidate. However, the effects induced by 7-b and the molecular mechanisms involved remain poorly understood in Burkitt's lymphoma. To shed light on these issues, we have investigated the effects of 7-b on proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis activity and oxidative stress levels of lymphoma Raji cells in vitro. Our results showed that 7-b inhibited the proliferation of Raji cells and induced G1 cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, 7-b treatment triggered programmed cell death, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alteration of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). Altogether our results showed that 7-b mediated its growth inhibitory effects on Raji cells via the activation of a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway and cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathway which subsequently targeted p21.
