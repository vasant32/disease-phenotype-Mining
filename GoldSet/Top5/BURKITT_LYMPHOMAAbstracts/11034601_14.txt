Recently, biochemical, cell biological, and genetic studies have converged to reveal that integral membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are critical regulators of growth and differentiation of epithelial and connective tissues. As a large number of cytokines involved in lymphoid tissue homeostasis or inflammation contain potential HS-binding domains, HSPGs presumably also play important roles in the regulation of the immune response. In this report, we explored the expression, regulation, and function of HSPGs on B lymphocytes. We demonstrate that activation of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and/or CD40 induces a strong transient expression of HSPGs on human tonsillar B cells. By means of these HSPGs, the activated B cells can bind hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a cytokine that regulates integrin-mediated B cell adhesion and migration. This interaction with HGF is highly selective since the HSPGs did not bind the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1 alpha, even though the affinities of HGF and SDF-1alpha for heparin are similar. On the activated B cells, we observed induction of a specific HSPG isoform of CD44 (CD44-HS), but not of other HSPGs such as syndecans or glypican-1. Interestingly, the expression of CD44-HS on B cells strongly promotes HGF-induced signaling, resulting in an HS-dependent enhanced phosphorylation of Met, the receptor tyrosine kinase for HGF, as well as downstream signaling molecules including Grb2-associated binder 1 (Gab1) and Akt/protein kinase B (PKB). Our results demonstrate that the BCR and CD40 control the expression of HSPGs, specifically CD44-HS. These HSPGs act as functional coreceptors that selectively promote cytokine signaling in B cells, suggesting a dynamic role for HSPGs in antigen-specific B cell differentiation.
