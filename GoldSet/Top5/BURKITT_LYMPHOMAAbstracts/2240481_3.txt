Three cases of two fungal agents causing simultaneous systemic infection in immunocompromised pediatric patients are presented and the literature is reviewed. All three patients had several underlying factors that predispose to systemic fungal infections. A species of candida was identified initially as an etiologic agent in all of the three patients causing subcutaneous abscesses, urinary tract infections, fungemia, catheter exit site infection, or pneumonia. However, a few days later blood cultures grew aspergillus species in two of the three patients; in the third patient aspergillus was identified on microscopic examination of the spleen. All three patients had an associated bacteremia with either Staphylococcus aureus or S. epidermidis requiring vancomycin therapy. Presence of aspergillus infection required treatment with amphotericin. Difficulties in making a definitive diagnosis of systemic fungal disease may explain paucity of reports in the literature with simultaneous polyfungal systemic infection.
