Precursor B-ALL blasts may be positive for CD20 in up to 50% of cases. There are few reports on the use of the anti CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, in children with B-ALL. We report on two adult patients with precursor B-ALL who developed significant hepatic toxicity during induction chemotherapy. Single agent rituximab was given until recovery of liver enzymes was established. Both patients were able to continue further chemotherapy, underwent an Allo BMT and are now 10-12 months after diagnosis in a continuous CR.
