A case is presented in which touch imprints of an abdominal mass in a young male revealed uniform, round-to-ovoid cells with a scanty rim of cytoplasm and round, uniform, smooth nuclei. The nuclear chromatin was coarsely clumped, and each nucleus contained multiple, prominent nucleoli. A simultaneous frozen section revealed these cells lying in trabeculae and sheets within a fibrous stroma. The cytologic appearance in the imprints aided in the rapid diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma. The preservation of nuclear detail obtainable in fixed wet imprints is emphasized, as is the use of these imprints as an aid in avoiding diagnostic pitfalls in the rapid diagnosis of a lymphoid neoplasm.
