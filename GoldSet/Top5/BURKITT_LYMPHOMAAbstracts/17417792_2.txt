Chronic Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has been linked to lymphoma of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), a tumor that is typically localized at presentation. Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (BL) frequently presents as an abdominal mass. However, primary gastric BL is unusual and the role of H. pylori in its pathogenesis is unclear. We describe a 12 year old with localized gastric BL and concurrent H. pylori infection. In this report, we discuss the potential association between H. pylori and gastric BL and also highlight certain similarities between gastric MALT lymphomas and BL arising in the stomach.
