The authors are reporting the course of 30 ovarian carcinomas treated between january 1st 1982 and june 30th 1985, in the department of Medicine and Oncology of the General Hospital in Brazzaville. They analyze the chemotherapies instituted for the treatment of epithelial, germinal tumors as well as Burkitt's lymphomas. The prognosis of ovarian cancer remains extremely poor since 19 patients died, 6 were lost to follow-up and considered as dead, and out of 5 living patients after 10 months, only 2 were in complete remission.
