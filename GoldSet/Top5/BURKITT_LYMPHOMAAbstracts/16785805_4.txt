We report 2 patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma who had positive restaging PET scans limited to the spleen and no significant uptake in nodal areas of previously known disease. Examination of the resected spleens from both patients revealed extensive inflammation surrounding necrotic tumor with no evidence of viable lymphoma or active infection. It is suggested that close observation of such patients for evidence of progressive disease may be considered as opposed to immediate intervention.
