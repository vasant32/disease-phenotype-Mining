The effect of human recombinant DNA interferon-alpha type A on inositol lipid and diacylglycerol metabolism was investigated in Daudi lymphoma whole cells and isolated nuclei. In isolated nuclei after 90 min of interferon treatment an enhanced rate of PIP2 phosphorylation and an increase of DAG mass were observed. In whole cells, after 1 min of interferon treatment, there was a rapid and transient shift of DAG mass apparently not related to inositol lipid modifications, thus indicating the presence in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of inositol lipid fractions with different metabolic features in response to interferon-alpha.
