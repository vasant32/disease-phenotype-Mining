In 42 patients with African Burkitt's lymphoma, we have studied biochemical and clinical correlations with prognosis. Clinical stage and anti-EA titer were the best predictive factors, but lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and uric acid (UA) concentrations also correlated with stage and prognosis, whereas lactic acid (LA), which was significantly elevated in Stage D, did not significantly correlated with prognosis or with LDH and UA levels. All of these factors with the possible exception of LA reflect the total body burden of tumor. We conclude that the tumor burden is the single most important prognostic factor in Burkitt's lymphoma, and that this is reflected directly by LDH and UA concentrations, and probably indirectly by anti-EA titer.
