About half of the patients with follicular lymphoma will develop an aggressive B cell lymphoma with morphological changes in growth pattern and cellular morphology. Changes of the immunophenotype, especially of the expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) have been documented less frequently. Multiple tumor samples of two patients with follicular lymphoma who developed tumor progression, were studied by Southern blot analysis for rearrangements of the Ig genes and the oncogenes BCL2 and MYC. In both patients, the general pattern of Ig gene rearrangements, especially of the Ig light-chain genes, and the structure of the t(14;18) breakpoint as assessed by the polymerase chain reaction (PRC) and fine restriction mapping, remained unaltered with time. However, both within the functional Ig heavy-chain allele and around the t(14;18) breakpoint, extensive secondary alterations took place. This indicates clonal evolution rather than the appearance of an independent lymphoma. In the first case with progression from follicular lymphoma to Burkitt's lymphoma 3 years after diagnosis, alterations were especially present 3' of the t(14;18) breakpoint. In the second patient with a change from follicular to diffuse centroblastic lymphoma 4 years after diagnosis, subsequent class switches from IgM to IgG and to defective IgH expression were accompanied by deletion of C mu sequences and a rearrangement of the MYC gene, respectively. Additionally, in both patients alterations in individual restriction sites occurred, which most likely were due to somatic mutations within both the functional IgH and translocated allele. Our data indicate that complex alterations of both the functional and non-functional IgH allele may accompany tumor progression and may erroneously suggest the appearance of independent clones by Southern blot analysis. It remains to be established whether these alterations are causative events or the consequence of genetic instability and clonal evolution.
