Ten consecutive patients were entered on a pilot study--for the treatment of children with far-advanced Burkitt's lymphoma--which was conducted at the Roswell Park Memorial Institute (R.P.M.I.) and the University of Rochester Medical Center (U. of R.). With the use of high-dose cyclophosphamide (HDC), intermediate-dose methotrexate (IDM), vincristine (VCR), prednisone (PRED), and intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy, nine of these 10 children achieved a complete remission (CR), and six of these nine children have remained in CR for more than 3 years and are likely cured of their disease. This regimen had significant, but generally manageable, toxicity. A single patient with ataxia-telangiectasia died during induction therapy of pneumonia and a gastrointestinal hemorrhage. A single patient with severe hemorrhagic cystitis required the substitution of cytosine arabinoside for cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) in the regimen. One of five children presenting with bone marrow involvement survives. Such involvement appears to place patients at greater risk for developing meningeal disease. Attempts at more aggressive methods of central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis should be employed in this group of patients.
