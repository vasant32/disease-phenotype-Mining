Burkitt's lymphoma was first reported by Burkitt in 1958 as a sarcoma involving the jaw in African children with characteristic symptoms. Forty three Japanese cases have been reported since the first description by Oboshi et al. in 1969. We report a case of Burkitt's lymphoma with left total ophthalmoplegia. A 73-year-old Japanese female was admitted in Sadamoto Hospital on July 11, 1983 with a two-week history of headache, ptosis and double vision. The patient was exposed to the atomic bomb in Hiroshima and had ten-year history of hypertension. On admission, physical examination showed hypertension and neurological examination revealed only left total ophthalmoplegia (such as left ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, mydriasis and deficit of light reflex). Plain X-ray film and enhanced CT scan showed no remarkable abnormalities. Laboratory examinations revealed high serum levels of GOT(51 K.U.) and LDH (1300 U.). Left carotid and right retrograde branchial angiograms showed no remarkable abnormal findings. While the patient was treated only conservatively, left abducent and trochleal nerve palsy appeared on August 5, 1983. On plain and enhanced CT scans at the time, abnormal density mass with bone destruction of the left sphenoidal sinus was demonstrated. Biopsy specimen from the left sphenoidal sinus showed lymphosarcomatous cells. Peripheral blood and bone marrow smears showed lymphoma cells which are compatible with L3-Burkitt's type according to FAB leukemia classification. The patient was diagnosed as leukemic transformation of Burkitt's lymphoma and treated with CHOP; Cyclophosphamide (C), Hydroxydaunorubicin(H), Vincristine (O), and Prednisolone (P).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
