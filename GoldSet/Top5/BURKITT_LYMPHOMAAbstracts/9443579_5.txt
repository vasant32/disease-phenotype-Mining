In response to viruses, monocytes and B cells produce TNF alpha. Therefore, we investigated TNF alpha gene expression and protein secretion in a human monocytic cell line, THP-1, and a Burkitt's lymphoma B-cell line, Namalwa, in response to hepatitis B virus (HBV). Stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (100 ng/ml for 48 h) induced TNF alpha secretion in THP-1 and Namalwa cells (100 to 300 pg/ml). In THP cells, the optimum response (> 2000 pg/ml) was obtained in the presence of a second mitogenic signal such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 microg/ml for 24 h). In our activation conditions, Northern blot analysis revealed a marked accumulation of TNF alpha mRNA species at 1.7 kb in both cell lines. When PMA- or PMA+LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells were exposed to HBV, TNF alpha protein and mRNA significantly decreased (> 50%). In contrast, HBV exposure of PMA-activated Namalwa cells resulted in strongly increased TNF alpha protein secretion (1 ng/ml). In this case, HBV induced TNF alpha mRNA accumulation that consisted of two types: a regular 1.7 kb and two novel high molecular weight (HMW) species at 3.7 and 4.3 kb. Exposure of stimulated THP-1 and Namalwa cells to HBV resulted in HBs and pre-S1 antigen production in the supernatants. In addition, HMW HBV DNA forms were detected in both cell lines, but with distinct HindIII restriction patterns. These findings indicate that TNF alpha gene expression may be differently regulated by HBV in activated human macrophages and B cells, and thus TNF alpha may be involved in the pathogenesis of HBV.
