The chromosomal aberrations in tumor cells obtained by bone marrow aspiration from a patient with non-endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) are reported. Twenty percent of the cells contained the marker chromosome 14q+ earlier described in endemic Burkitt's tumors. Other marker chromosomes were dound only in mitoses which did not contain the 14q+.
