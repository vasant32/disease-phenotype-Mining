Eight patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia of Burkitt's type (ALL-L3) and two patients with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) were subjected for cytogenetic studies. Translocation (8;14)(q24;q32) was present in nine (90%) patients; seven patients of ALL-L3 and two of BL. One ALL-L3 patient revealed t(14;18)(q32;q21) in 100 per cent metaphases. Additional clonal chromosomal anomalies present in these patients were deletion (6q) (40%) and trisomy 21(20%). The occurrence of t(8;14)(q24;q32) in ALL-L3 and BL patients in our series supports the association of t(8;14) with ALL-L3 and Burkitt's lymphoma.
