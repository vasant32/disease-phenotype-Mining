The ING1 is a newly cloned putative tumor-suppressor gene, which is involved in the p53 signaling pathway. We found decreased expression of ING1 mRNA in 4 of 5 T-cell lines and 5 of 11 B-cell lines including two Burkitt lymphomas and two myelomas. These observations suggest that decreased ING1 expression might play an important role in the development or progression of some lymphoid tumors. Polymerase chain reaction-SSCP and sequencing analyses found neither point mutations nor small deletions in the ING1 gene, suggesting that decreased expression is due to transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms.
