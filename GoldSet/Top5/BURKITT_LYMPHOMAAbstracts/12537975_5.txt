We showed heterogeneous disease spectrum among 15 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases with mature B-cell phenotype diagnosed over the past 7 years at our institution. Besides those with typical L3 morphology and 8q24 (c-myc) translocation (n=6), there were cases showing L1 or L2 morphology without 8q24 translocation (n=6), unusually large L3 blasts in hyperdiploid clone (n=2) and blastoid variant of mantle cell lymphoma (n=1). The expression of CD5 and cyclin D1 may need to be routinely determined on ALL cases with mature B-cell phenotype and non-L3 morphology to facilitate timely diagnosis of blastoid MCL and institution of suitable management.
