A glycoprotein of 70 kDa (GP70) was isolated from sera of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) patients and used to immunize rabbits. Anti-GP70 antibodies at a high titer were obtained and used for screening of cancer cells of various origin by the indirect immunofluorescence test. Thus, 66% of BL-cell lines tested were positive to GP70. On the other hand, all lymphoblastoid cell lines tested were negative. Moreover, all peripheral blood cells and mononuclear cells from tonsils were negative, indicating specificity of antibodies to malignant transformation. Comparison between positively stained BL-cell lines indicated no correlation between the presence of GP70 and EBNA. Positive stain (1-5%) obtained with bone marrow cells might indicate that anti-GP70 antibodies are directed against a surface membrane differentiation glycoprotein.
