Recently, it has been found that inappropriate expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is strongly associated with carcinogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of miRNAs (miRs) -143 and -145, the levels of which were previously shown to be reduced in colon cancers and various kinds of established cancer cell lines, was also decreased in most of the B-cell malignancies examined, including chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL), B-cell lymphomas, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-cell lines, and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. All samples from 13 CLL patients and eight of nine B-cell lymphoma ones tested exhibited an extremely low expression of miRs-143 and -145. The expression levels of miRs-143 and -145 were consistently low in human Burkitt lymphoma cell lines and were inversely associated with the cell proliferation observed in the EBV-transformed B-cell lines. Moreover, the introduction of either precursor or mature miR-143 and -145 into Raji cells resulted in a significant growth inhibition that occurred in a dose-dependent manner and the target gene of miRNA-143 was determined to be ERK5, as previously reported in human colon cancer DLD-1 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that miRs-143 and -145 may be useful as biomarkers that differentiate B-cell malignant cells from normal cells and contribute to carcinogenesis in B-cell malignancies by a newly defined mechanism.
