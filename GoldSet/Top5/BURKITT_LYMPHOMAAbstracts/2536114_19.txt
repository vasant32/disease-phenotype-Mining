Specific antisera were generated to characterize Epstein-Barr virus proteins reported to have trans-activating properties. Open reading frame BRLF1 was found to be expressed in two modifications in vivo, with molecular sizes ranging from 94 to 98 kilodaltons (kDa) depending on the cell line, whereas only one protein (Raji cells, 96 kDa) was detected by in vitro translation. Open reading frame BZLF1 encoded polypeptides of 38 and 35 kDa and additional smaller forms. A BZLF1-encoded 30-kDa protein could be detected under conditions in which expression was restricted to immediate early genes. Nuclear localization could be detected under conditions in which expression was restricted to immediate early genes. Nuclear localization could be shown for the proteins derived from reading frames BZLF1 and BMLF1. BMLF1 expression gave a heterogeneous protein pattern, with molecular sizes between 45 and 70 kDa, including a predominant 60-kDa protein detected in different B-cell lines.
