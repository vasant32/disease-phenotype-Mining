The ability to eliminate malignant cells from bone marrow (BM) while retaining sufficient numbers of normal progenitors to ensure engraftment, may well establish the future of autologous BM transplantation (ABMT) for hematologic malignancies. In this study, we describe the effects of methylprednisolone (MP) and etoposide (VP16) alone or in combination on 5 tumor cell lines (HL-60, a promyelocytic cell line; Molt-4, a T cell leukemia; Daudi, a Burkitt's lymphoma and R10/8226 and R40/8226, doxorubicin-resistant myeloma cell lines). The tumor cell kill efficiency of the drugs was assayed using the limiting dilution assay. We determined the toxic effect on progenitor cells by assaying granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU). With a combination of MP at 10(-3) M and VP16 at 75 microM, we observed the following log reduction in tumor cell clones: HL-60, 4.695 +/- 0.001; Molt-4, 3.626 +/- 0.036; Daudi, 5.633 +/- 0.001; R10/8226, 3.052 +/- 0.544; R40/8226, 3.126 +/- 0.080. CFU recovery was 24% +/- 5%. Mixing tumor cell lines with a 20-fold excess of normal irradiated BM cells did not eliminate the inhibitory effect of the drug combination. We propose that MP and VP16 used in concert produce effective purging of malignant hematopoietic cells from BM while sparing normal progenitors needed for engraftment.
