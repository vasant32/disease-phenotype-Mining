Pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (cALL) commonly occurs in young patients and although successful conventional therapies are available (such as cytotoxic drugs and bone marrow transplantation) for a proportion of patients (approximately 30%) these are ultimately unsuccessful. Recurrence of disease is a result of the failure of the immune system to recognize these abnormal cells and down-regulation of crucial molecules required for cognate CD4(+) T cell recognition has been postulated as a means of immune escape. In this study we show that an embryonic kidney cell line (293 cells) transfected with CD154 (40 L.1) are capable of not only maintaining the viability of primary ALL cells in culture but can also up-regulate the expression of a number of crucial molecules involved in antigen recognition. We show that 40 L.1 cell stimulation of primary ALL cell cultures can not only enhance the allogeneic and autologous MLR response to such cells but will also induce CTL effectors which are capable of lysing wild-type autologous ALL cells. It is therefore conceivable that such an approach could be used to generate an active anti-tumour response in patients, following conventional therapy, reducing the incidence of recurrence.
