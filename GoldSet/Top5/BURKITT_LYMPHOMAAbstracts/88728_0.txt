Our knowledge of antigens which are associated with different types of malignant tumours is steadily increasing. These antigens exist in considerable numbers, but, so far with few exceptions, only their presence can be demonstrated by certain methods; to isolate and identify them has not yet been possible. These antigens are, therefore, suitable not so much for the primary diagnosis, but rather, like the carcinoembryonic antigen, the tissue-polypeptide antigen or the alpha-feto-protein, for assessing the success of treatment. Active immunization has recently received a fresh impulse by the use of the enzyme neuraminidase, derived from Vibrio cholerae, in the treatment of tumour cells. There is no passive specific immunotherapy in human cancer. As to specific active immunotherapy BCG, Corynebacterium parvum and preparations of these and other micro-organisms together with polynucleotides, levamisol, statolon, tilorone have been employed. Although the results are not uniform they are promising. Attempts at cellular transfer of immunity are not very encouraging. It should be emphasized that the findings apply to human cancer. Experimental studies have produced very interesting results.
