One hundred four histologically proven malignant tumors of the eye and orbit in children seen in Guinness Eye Clinic, Kaduna, Nigeria between 1975 and 1982 are presented. Retinoblastoma and Burkitt's lymphoma account for the majority of the tumors. The data are compared with those from Ibadan, Nigeria. Burkitt's lymphoma occurs less frequently in Kaduna, whereas the incidence of retinoblastoma is almost the same. Chloroma, which was not seen in Ibadan, accounted for 2.9% of the current series. Factors that may be contributory to the observed differences are discussed.
