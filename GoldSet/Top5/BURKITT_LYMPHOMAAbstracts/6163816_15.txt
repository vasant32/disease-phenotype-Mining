We have stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro with autologous EBV-infected or noninfected B cells. A cytotoxic response was obtained only when virally infected cells were used. The activity of the effector cells was restricted by the major histocompatibility complex and was directed against EBV-genome-bearing targets. The highest cytolytic response was obtained when lymphocytes of individuals previously exposed to the virus (EBV-VCA positive) were used. Lymphocytes of noninfected donors (EBV-VCA negative) gave a low response; the relative frequency of their effector cells was at least 4-fold lower. Lymphocytes of newborns did not respond. The cytotoxic activity was mediated by T lymphocytes of the cytotoxic/suppressor subset, as determined by cytofluorographic analysis and antibody plus complement-mediated lysis, using monoclonal antibodies to human lymphocyte surface antigen.
