Five cases of unusual presentation of Burkitt's lymphoma are reported; three of these, had localised scalp tumours or peripheral lymph nodes. Another case presented with paraplegia and rectal bleeding which disappeared on our standard chemotherapy consisting cyclophosphamide, vincristine and methotrexate (COM). The fifth case who developed pleural effusion during chemotherapy initially presented with abdominal tumour. These five cases illustrate the protean presentation of Burkitt's lymphoma.
