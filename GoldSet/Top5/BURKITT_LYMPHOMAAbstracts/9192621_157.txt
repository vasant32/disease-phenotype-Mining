Cancer cells are able to overproduce lactic acid aerobically, whereas normal cells undergo anaerobic glycolysis only when deprived of oxygen. Tumor aerobic glycolysis was recognized about seven decades ago; however, its molecular basis has remained elusive. The lactate dehydrogenase-A gene (LDH-A), whose product participates in normal anaerobic glycolysis and is frequently increased in human cancers, was identified as a c-Myc-responsive gene. Stably transfected Rat1a fibroblasts that overexpress LDH-A alone or those transformed by c-Myc overproduce lactic acid. LDH-A overexpression is required for c-Myc-mediated transformation because lowering its level through antisense LDH-A expression reduces soft agar clonogenicity of c-Myc-transformed Rat1a fibroblasts, c-Myc-transformed human lymphoblastoid cells, and Burkitt lymphoma cells. Although antisense expression of LDH-A did not affect the growth of c-Myc-transformed fibroblasts adherent to culture dishes under normoxic conditions, the growth of these adherent cells in hypoxia was reduced. These observations suggest that an increased LDH-A level is required for the growth of a transformed spheroid cell mass, which has a hypoxic internal microenvironment. Our studies have linked c-Myc to the induction of LDH-A, whose expression increases lactate production and is necessary for c-Myc-mediated transformation.
