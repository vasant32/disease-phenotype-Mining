Circulating immune complexes were detected in 49% of sera from patients with multiple sclerosis, 45% of monosymptomatic optic neuritis, 45% of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, and 15% of normal sera studied. The frequency of immune complexes in multiple-sclerosis sera was not correlated with the clinical status of the patients. Results with serial blood-samples were variable.
