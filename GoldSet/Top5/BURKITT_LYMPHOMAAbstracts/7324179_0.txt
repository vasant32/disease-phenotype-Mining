A case of Burkitt's lymphoma is reported in a 5-year-old girl with involvement of the jaw and loosening of the teeth. Bilateral ovarian involvement occurred and subsequently dissemination to the CNS retrobulbar spaces causing exophthalmus, the thyroid, the myocardium, and other sites. The therapeutic plan included irradiation of the mandible and systemic chemotherapy. Due to the rapid deterioration of the patient's condition, irradiation was suspended at 1,200 rads. Chemotherapy was not administered since the bone marrow was completely replaced by lymphomatous tissue.
