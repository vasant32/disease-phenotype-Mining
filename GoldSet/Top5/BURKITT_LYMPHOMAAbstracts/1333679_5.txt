The clinical and histological findings in a 54-year-old patient with enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) occurring 18 years after renal transplantation are presented. Ten years after adult-onset coeliac disease the patient developed medium to large T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the small intestine. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome was detected by polymerase chain reaction in the lymphoma tissue and localized via Epstein-Barr virus RNAs in situ hybridization to some of the tumour cells. This is the first case report of EBV-positive EATL occurring in the setting of immunosuppression.
