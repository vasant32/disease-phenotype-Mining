In this study, we compared the ability of different bispecific monoclonal antibodies (BsmAb) and immunotoxins to deliver the type 1 ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP) saporin and gelonin through the CD25 or CD30 target molecules to Hodgkin's lymphoma cells. An anti-CD25/antisaporin and an anti-CD30/antisaporin BsmAb enhanced the toxicity of the relevant RIP against the CD25+CD30+ L540 Hodgkin's lymphoma cell line, although targeting by anti-CD30 BsmAb appeared eight times more efficient. Two anti-CD30/antigelonin BsmAb, reacting with different epitopes of the gelonin molecule, were able to enhance gelonin toxicity against L540 cells and had a synergistic effect when used in combination. Among CD25-CD30+ Hodgkin's lymphoma lines, which were resistant to targeting by anti-CD25/saporin BsmAb, one (L428) was sensitive to both gelonin and saporin delivered by anti-CD30 BsmAb. Another CD25-CD30+ cell line (COLE) was completely resistant to the toxic effect of gelonin targeted by the two synergistic BsmAb, as well as to an anti-CD30/gelonin immunotoxin. However, these cells were partially sensitive to saporin delivered by an anti-CD30/anti-saporin BsmAb, and they were efficiently killed by an anti-CD30/saporin immunotoxin. These results indicate that heterogeneity in the sensitivity to certain RIP, such as gelonin, exists among tumor cells of the same histotype.
