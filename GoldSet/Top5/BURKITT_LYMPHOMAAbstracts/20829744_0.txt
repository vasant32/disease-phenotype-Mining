 PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of 20-gauge (20-G) and 25-gauge (25-G) vitrectomy on cell viability and diagnostic yield (surface marker expression) using flow cytometry and human lymphoma cells in culture. METHODS: Cultured human Burkitt lymphoma cells (Raji B-cell lymphoma line) were allocated into five study groups in Roswell Park Memorial Institute media. By using manual aspiration, cells were then processed by aspiration alone, by 20-G vitrectomy at 600 cuts per minute (cpm) and 1,500 cpm, or by 25-G vitrectomy at both 600 and 1,500 cpm. To assess cell viability and cell surface marker expression, samples underwent standard flow cytometry analysis for suspected lymphoma using 7-amino-actinomycin D and antibodies against CD45, CD19, lambda, and kappa light chains. RESULTS: Twenty-five samples were processed after being divided into four vitrectomy groups and one nonvitrectomy group (control). The mean cell viability was 98.5 for both the nonvitrectomized and vitrectomized specimens. The percentage of cells positive for CD45 or kappa light chain was the same in the nonvitrectomized and vitrectomized groups. In addition, the level of expression of these molecules was not significantly different in all five groups. Similarly, no difference was seen for these markers between 20-G and 25-G vitrectomy at either a cut rate of 600 or 1,500 cpm. The percentage positive for CD19 was significantly lower for the 20-G vitrectomy at 1,500 cpm compared with the 25-G vitrectomy at both 600 and 1,500 cpm. Percentage of CD19 cells was greater for the 25-G vitrectomy at 600 cpm than the nonvitrectomy group. CONCLUSION: Compared with simple aspiration, both 20-G and 25-G vitrectomy seem to have no significant effect on cell viability or diagnostic yield for B-cell lymphoma cells (Raji cell line) in suspension based on flow cytometry. Further studies need to be conducted to study and compare 20-G versus 25-G vitrectomy on lymphoma cells in human vitreous or in an animal model.
