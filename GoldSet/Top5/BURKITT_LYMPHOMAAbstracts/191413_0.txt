Virus producing, VCA (viral capsid antigen)-positive cells could be selectively removed from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-carrying, virus-producer P3HR-1 cultures by two different methods of column passage. In the first, the virus-producing cells were covered with human EBV antibody and subsequently passaged through anti-human-Ig columns. In the second methods, untreated P3HR-1 cells were allowed to pass through columns of EBV receptor-positive cell lines or, as controls, EBV receptor-positive cell lines or, as controls, EBV receptor-negative cells. The majority of the VCA-positive cells were selectively removed by both techniques. The second method involves the attachment of EBV-producer cells, known to accumulate viral envelope material in their plasma membrane, to EBV receptors. In view of recent evidence indicating an association between EBV and complement receptors, human and mouse complement were tested for their ability to block this attachment. Fresh mouse and human complement regularly exerted blocking activity, whereas heat-inactivated human serum did not block. Heat-inactivated mouse serum did block occasionally, but the effect was more irregular than with fresh mouse serum. Trypsin treatment of the EBV-receptor colum abolished its ability to retain VCA-positive cells.
