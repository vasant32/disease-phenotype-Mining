Although the key role of human homeobox (HOX) genes in development is well established, their function in adult cells is still under scrutiny. We have analyzed, in normal adult blood cell subpopulations, acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) cells lines, and primary blasts, the RNA expression of all HOX-2 cluster genes (5'-2.5, 2.4, 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3') and nine genes in the HOX-1, -3, and -4 cluster by Northern blotting, RNAse protection, and/or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The analyzed HOX-1, -3, and -4 genes were never expressed in all tested cell populations. Natural killer (NK) cells activated in interleukin-2 (IL-2)/IL-1 beta-treated cultures exhibit a gradually increasing, abundant expression of three HOX-2 genes (2.2, 2.6, 2.8), while three other genes (2.3, 2.1, 2.7) are expressed at a lower level at late culture times. However, no HOX-2 gene is expressed in quiescent lymphocytes (NK, B and T [T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha/beta, gamma/delta lymphocytes, thymocytes] cells), granulocytes, and monocytes. In B- and T-ALL cell lines, HOX-2 genes are expressed according to different patterns: (1) widespread transcription (seven of nine genes, including 2.3 and 2.6) in the Peer line bearing the TCR gamma/delta; (2) expression of 2.5, 2.2, and 2.6 in the SEZ 627 line, which derives from an HTLV-1+ T-helper leukemia; (3) transcription of 2.3 and 2.6 in both the T-ALL CEM line and four B-ALL lines (interestingly, CALLA- B-ALL lines are constantly 2.3/2.6 RNA+); (4) no HOX-2 gene expression was detected in one T- and two B-ALL lines. Primary blasts from five T- and five pre-B-ALL showed selective expression of one or more HOX-2 genes, namely 2.5, 2.2, 2.6, and 2.7. Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that selected HOX-2 genes play a role in the IL-2/IL-1 beta-induced activation and/or proliferation of normal NK lymphocytes and possibly in the oncogenetic process of some T- and B-ALL.
