A patient with non-African Burkitt's lymphoma is reported in whom bilateral breast involvement was detected by both mammography and 67-Ga-citrate scintigraphy. The causes of breast uptake of 67Ga-citrate are reviewed, and it is noted that not only asymmetrical increases in uptake of 6767Ga-citrate are indicative of disease.
