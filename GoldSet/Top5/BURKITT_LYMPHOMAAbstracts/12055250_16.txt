B, alpha beta T, and NK lymphocytes establish immunological synapses (IS) with their targets to enable recognition. Transfer of target cell-derived Ags together with proximal molecules onto the effector cell appears also to occur through synapses. Little is known about the molecular basis of this transfer, but it is assumed to result from Ag receptor internalization. Because human gamma delta T cells recognize soluble nonpeptidic phosphoantigens as well as tumor cells such as Daudi, it is unknown whether they establish IS with, and extract molecules from, target cells. Using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, we show in this work that Ag-stimulated human V gamma 9/V delta 2 T cells conjugate to, and perform molecular transfer from, various tumor cell targets. The molecular transfer appears to be linked to IS establishment, evolves in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of either soluble or cellular Ag, and requires gamma delta TCR ligation, Src family kinase signaling, and participation of the actin cytoskeleton. Although CD45 exclusion characterized the IS performed by gamma delta T cells, no obvious capping of the gamma delta TCR was detected. The synaptic transfer mediated by gamma delta T cells involved target molecules unrelated to the cognate Ag and occurred independently of MHC class I expression by target cells. From these observations, we conclude that despite the particular features of gamma delta T cell activation, both synapse formation and molecular transfer of determinants belonging to target cell characterize gamma delta T cell recognition of Ags.
