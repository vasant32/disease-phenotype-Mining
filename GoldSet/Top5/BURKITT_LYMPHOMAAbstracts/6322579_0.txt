In 1981, 54 Epstein-Barr virus-seronegative pregnant women in the Sacramento-Davis area of California were observed prospectively for an average duration of 12.1 months for Epstein-Barr virus-seroconversion. Only one seroconverted. Two of the 54 women remained negative for Epstein-Barr virus antibody 4.5-5.0 months after their husbands were proved to be Epstein-Barr virus excreters. Short of experimental pharyngeal introduction of the virus into human volunteers, these data provide the most direct evidence possible that the intimate exposure of Epstein-Barr virus-seronegative adults to the virus does not necessarily result in infection.
