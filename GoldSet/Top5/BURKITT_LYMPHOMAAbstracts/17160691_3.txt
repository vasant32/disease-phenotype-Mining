 OBJECT: Demonstrating the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 T of ultrasmall particle iron oxide (USPIO)-antibody bound to tumor cells in vitro and in a murine xenotransplant model. METHODS: Human D430B cells or Raji Burkitt lymphoma cells were incubated in vitro with different amounts of commercially available USPIO-anti-CD20 antibodies and cell pellets were stratified in a test tube. For in vivo studies, D430B cells and Raji lymphoma cells were inoculated subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice. MRI at 1.5 T was performed with T1-weighted three-dimensional fast field echo sequences (17/4.6/13 degrees ) and T2-weighted three-dimensional fast-field echo sequences (50/12/7 degrees ). For in vivo studies MRI was performed before and 24 h after USPIO-anti-CD20 administration. RESULTS: USPIO-anti-CD20-treated D430B cells, showed a dose-dependent decrease in signal intensity (SI) on T2*-weighted images and SI enhancement on T1-weighted images in vitro. Raji cells showed lower SI changes, in accordance to the fivefold lower expression of CD20 on Raji with respect to D430B cells. In vivo 24 h after USPIO-anti-CD20 administration, both tumors showed an inhomogeneous decrease of SI on T2*-weighted images and SI enhancement on T1-weighted images. CONCLUSIONS: MRI at 1.5 T is able to detect USPIO-antibody conjugates targeting a tumor-associated antigen in vitro and in vivo.
