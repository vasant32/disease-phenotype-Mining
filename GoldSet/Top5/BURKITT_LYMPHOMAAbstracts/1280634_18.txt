Tenascin is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein produced in response to epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that initiate fetal organogenesis, and it is also found in the stroma of benign and malignant neoplasms. Thirty-five human cell lines representing a variety of cancers were examined by immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of radiolabeled tenascin proteins from conditioned media. Two forms of tenascin with relative molecular masses of 190,000 and 250,000 were identified. Eight cell lines produced both forms. With the exception of myeloid and lymphoid leukemias and Burkitt's lymphoma, all of the mesodermal and neuroectodermal tumor lines were found to synthesize tenascin. Unexpectedly, tenascin was secreted by several mammary and colonic adenocarcinomas as well as by a line derived from normal mammary epithelial cells, and in some cases increased production was induced by transforming growth factor beta in serum-free medium. Cells producing fibronectin but not tenascin attached and spread on plastic culture dishes, while those producing tenascin alone remained suspended in the medium or were rarely attached. Tenascin also inhibited fibronectin-mediated adhesion of MCF7 breast carcinoma cells in vitro. The results suggest that tenascins synthesized and secreted by some cancer cells, especially those of epithelial origin, may have specific roles in determining tumor cell adhesion and ultimately the ability to form invasive outgrowths.
