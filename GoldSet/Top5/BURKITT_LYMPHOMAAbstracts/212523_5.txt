Detection of the Epstein-Barr (EBV) antigens, early antigen (EA), viral capsid antigen (VCA), and nuclear antigen (EBNA) by the indirect immunoperoxidase technique was highly sensitive. Antibody titers to EBNA, EA, and VCA were determined in more than 25 sera of patients with Burkitt lymphoma (BL), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), or normal persons. A good correlation between the titers of these antigens was obtained by the immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence methods. The indirect (anti-IgG) immunoperoxidase technique for the detection of EBNA is, in contrast to the indirect immunofluorescence method, highly sensitive. EBNA was associated with the chromosomes in cells arrested in the metaphase with colchicine.
