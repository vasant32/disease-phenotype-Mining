Fas (Apo-1/CD95) ligand (FasL) is a cytotoxic molecule used by T lymphocytes and natural killer cells for target-cell killing and by nonmalignant and malignant cells in the suppression of immune responses. In this study, FasL expression in B- and T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas was investigated by paraffin immunohistochemical analysis. FasL expression was found to be weak in nonaggressive lymphomas (chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma, Grade 1 follicular center cell lymphoma) and mantle cell lymphoma but strong in aggressive B-cell lymphomas (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's-lymphoma). Precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphomas were more heterogeneous, with expression varying from weak to strong. In T-cell lymphomas (anaplastic large-cell lymphoma; peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified), strong FasL expression was observed. Apparently, FasL expression is not limited to neoplasms derived from T cells or natural killer cells, and it might play a supporting role in the progression of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
