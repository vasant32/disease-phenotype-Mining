In this article, the studies on the method of inducing lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells from cord blood lymphocytes, the killing ability of LAK cells to tumor subculture cells K562 and Raji, the comparison of the killing activity to tumor subculture cells among LAK cells from cord blood lymphocytes, adult's Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and gynecologic cancer patient's PBL was presented. The changes of the OKT antigens on the surface of cord blood LAK cells tested with monoclonal antibodies was described. The morphologic changes resulted from the killing activity of LAK cells to target cells were observed by microscopy and electron-microscopy after a definite time co-incubation of the LAK cells and Raji cells. The results showed that: (1) LAK cells could be induced from cord blood and the induced LAK cells could remarkably kill the tumor subculture cell lines including nature killer (NK)-sensitive K562 cells as well as NK-insensitive Raji cells; (2) The activity of cord blood LAK cells is higher than that of the LAK cells from gynecologic cancer patient's PBL, But no significant difference with that of the LAK cells from normal adult's PBL; (3) T+3, T+8, the OKT antigens of cord blood LAK cells are just the same as human LAK cells from other sources; (4) After a definite time co-incubation, the cord blood LAK cells and Raji cells could form atypical rosette-circles under light microscopy. In the field of transmission electron-microscopy, the cord blood LAK cells had a certain active mobility. Raji cells, when incubated with the cord LAK cells for 4 hours, would become apoptosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
