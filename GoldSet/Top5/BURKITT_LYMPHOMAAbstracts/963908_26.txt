The expression of complement receptors, of Fc receptors, of SRBC receptors and of S-Ig was investigated on human haematopoietic cell lines of proved malignant derivation. According to their origin and to a panel of phenotypic markers these lines have been classified into lymphoma lines, myeloma lines and leukemia lines. Results were compared with those obtained on non-malignant EBV carrying lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). Among the lymphoid cell lines the LCL showed a pattern of B-lymphocyte surface markers, i.e. surface immunoglobulins, C3 receptors but low density of Fc receptors. The non-Burkitt lymphoma lines bore in varying degree these B-lymphocyte markers. The lines U-698 M and DG-75 were exceptional in having only surface immunoglobulin. The Burkitt lymphoma lines had all B-lymphocyte markers. The myeloma lines differed from the lymphoid lines in lacking C3 and Fc receptors and showed only trace amounts of surface immunoglobulins. In contrast to lymphoid and myeloma lines, the leukaemia lines were completely lacking surface immunoglobulins, but showed C3 and Fc receptors in variable densities. On line, the ALL derived line MOLT-3 showed the capacity to spontaneous rosette formation with SRBC. The findings that LCL presented a homogeneous pattern of B-lymphocyte surface markers may be of value in order to discriminate between these lines and lines derived from haematopoietic malignancies other than Burkitt lymphomas.
