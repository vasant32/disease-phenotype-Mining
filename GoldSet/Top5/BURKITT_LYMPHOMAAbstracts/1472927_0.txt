Glycosylated and total serum ferritin levels were monitored in patients with acute leukemia and lymphoma undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Serum ferritin was high in relapsing patients and normal in most patients in complete remission (CR). In patients with an uncomplicated course, levels of ferritin increased during the first month after BMT with subsequent decrease. Three patients with lymphoma and five with acute leukemia had high serum ferritin levels despite achieving apparent complete hematological remission which was of short duration. The results were compared with groups of lymphoma patients at presentation and during remission and with healthy normal controls. In all the lymphoma patients and in 3 of the 5 leukemia patients the percent of ferritin glycosylation was normal at CR. It was low at the time of diagnosis in all patients. Thus, the percent glycosylation proved a more reliable marker for clinical remission than total serum ferritin. During follow up after BMT in uncomplicated cases, the percent of glycosylated ferritin returned to normal levels earlier than the total serum ferritin. These findings indicate that the evaluation of the amount of glycosylated ferritin may provide useful information in hematological patients in whom there is a discrepancy between high serum ferritin levels and the clinical condition.
