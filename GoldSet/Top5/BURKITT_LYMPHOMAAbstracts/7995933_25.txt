The intracellular trafficking, proteolysis, and dissociation of invariant chain (li) associated with nascent class II molecules was examined in B-lymphoblastoid cells. Metabolic labeling and Percoll gradient centrifugation was used to assess the kinetics of delivery and processing of class II-li complexes within the endocytic pathway. Catabolism of class II-li complexes rapidly followed their delivery from post-Golgi compartments to dense lysosome-like compartments distinct from early and late endosomes. Direct peptide binding assays revealed that class II molecules associated with even small N-terminal fragments of li failed to bind peptide. Cysteine protease inhibitors alone blocked li proteolysis/dissociation and accumulation of class II-li biosynthetic intermediates within lysosome-containing compartments. Active-site labeling of cysteine proteases in B cells was used to identify cysteine proteases capable of mediating li proteolysis within endosomal compartments. Our results indicate rapid, possibly direct, transport of nascent class II-li complexes from the Golgi/trans-Golgi network to dense lysosomal compartments wherein cysteine protease(s), likely including cathepsin B, mediate complete removal of li. Inhibition of cysteine protease activity results in the accumulation of incompletely processed class II-li complexes, which lack peptide binding ability, within lysosomal compartments.
