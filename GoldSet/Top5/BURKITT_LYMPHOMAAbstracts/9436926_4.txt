A total of 34 leukemia and lymphoma samples (17 clinical samples and 17 cell lines) were analyzed for mutations of the Smad2 gene by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism (RT-PCR-SSCP) analysis. Nine of the 34 samples had 18q chromosomal abnormalities. No shifted bands were detected in any of the hematological malignancies. Our results suggest that resistance to cell growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta in hematological malignancies is not due to alterations of the Smad2 gene.
