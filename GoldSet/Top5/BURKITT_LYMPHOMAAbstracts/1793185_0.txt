We analyze the survival rate in 17 pediatric patients (twelve males and five females) that were diagnoses of non-Hodgkin's lymphoblastic lymphoma (cases with Burkitt's lymphoma were excluded) during the period from 1982 to 1990. All of them were treated using the LSA2-L2 therapeutic protocol. The follow-up period ranged from 14 to 99 months (follow-up median 43 months). Staging of our newly diagnosed patients, we found 9 patients in stage III and 8 in stage IV disease. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The overall survival rate of our patients is 69.5% and the disease free survival is 62.6%. The disease free survival for separated stages is 66.5% for stage III and 58.3% for stage IV. We compare our results with other casuisties published in literature.
