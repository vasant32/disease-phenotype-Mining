Interest in gamma9delta2 T cells has increased greatly in the past decade. While several protocols allowed the amplification of a large proportion of these cells in vitro, the purity of the final preparation is usually heterogeneous between different donors. Functional studies of this population are often controversial due to the presence of other populations such as NK cells which share a wide range of characteristics. Here, the gamma9delta2 T cells labelled-fraction is purified and mixed with the irradiated unlabelled fraction followed by a single stimulation with phosphoantigen, in turn followed by a classical step of amplification in the presence of interleukin 2. In this study, we describe a straightforward protocol to amplify pure populations of gamma9delta2 T cells which could be useful in fundamental research or in the development of a new generation of gammadelta cell therapy protocol.
