Human Raji B lymphoid cells after exposure for 64 h to a 1 mT (rms) 50 Hz sinusoidal magnetic field showed a reorganization of membrane and cytoskeletal components. Atomic force microscopy in air revealed several modifications in 80% of the exposed cells, such as loss of microvilli-like structures followed by progressive appearance of membrane introflections. This change in plasma membrane morphology was also accompanied by a different actin distribution, as detected by phalloidin fluorescence. These observations support our previous hypothesis that electric and magnetic fields may modify the plasma membrane structure.
