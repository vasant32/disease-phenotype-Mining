Seventy-eight patients with Burkitt's lymphoma and seventy controls from Ghana were typed for HLA-A, B, C and DR antigens, to determine whether there is an association between the HLA system and Burkitt's lymphoma. Increased relative risk was observed in Burkitt's lymphoma patients with DR7, HLA-A1 and B12(BW44).
