 PURPOSE: To compare outcomes of patients with HIV-Burkitt's lymphoma (HIV-BL) and HIV-diffuse large-cell lymphoma (HIV-DLCL) after treatment with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) or M-BACOD (methotrexate, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide) in pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) versus HAART eras. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred sixty-three patients with AIDS-related lymphoma diagnosed from 1982 to 2003 were reviewed retrospectively, including 262 in the pre-HAART (HIV-BL, 117; HIV-DLCL, 145) and 101 in the HAART era (HIV-BL, 18; HIV-DLCL, 83). Pre-HAART included those who did not receive HAART, and HAART era included those diagnosed after January 1997 who received HAART. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups in terms of age, sex, history of injection drug use, prior AIDS, lactate dehydrogenase level, and disease stage at diagnosis. Compared with HIV-BL, HIV-DLCL was associated with significantly lower CD4 counts in the pre-HAART but not the HAART era. Although the overall median survival was similar for both groups in the pre-HAART era (HIV-BL, 6.4 months v HIV-DLCL, 8.3 months; P = .43), survival was significantly worse in patients with HIV-BL in the HAART era (HIV-BL, 5.7 months v HIV-DLCL, 43.2 months; P = .0003). Failure to attain complete remission and CD4 count less than 100 cells/mm(3) independently predicted for poor survival in the pre-HAART era. In comparison, histology of HIV-BL and no attainment of complete remission were independent poor prognostic factors in the HAART era. CONCLUSION: Survival of patients with HIV-DLCL has improved in the HAART era, along with CD4 count, whereas survival of similarly treated patients with HIV-BL remained poor. The current practice of using the same regimen for both groups of patients should be re-evaluated.
