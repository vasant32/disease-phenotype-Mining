The endocytosis and degradation of 125I-labeled anti-mu monoclonal antibody DA4-4 by a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line was investigated using biochemical, chromatographic, electrophoretic, radioautographic, and electron microscopic techniques. 125I-DA4-4 was rapidly internalized by Ramos cells and routed from endosomes to lysosomes. Proteolysis of radiolabeled antibodies began in a late endosomal compartment, but lysosomes were primarily responsible for the terminal degradation of 125I-DA4-4. Catabolism of 125I-DA4-4 could be inhibited by 74-95% by blocking its delivery to late endosomes and lysosomes by incubation at 18 degrees C, by neutralizing the pH in intracellular organelles with monensin or ammonium chloride, or by inhibiting lysosomal enzymes with leupeptin. Radiolabeled antibodies synthesized using the chloramine T or Iodo-Gen techniques were degraded three times faster than conjugates made using a nonmetabolizable 125I-tyramine cellobiose adduct. Five major intermediate metabolites (Mr 48,000, 42,000, 25,000, 15,000, and 10,000) were generated during the intracellular catabolism of 125I-DA4-4, but 125I-tyrosine was responsible for 95% of the small-molecular-weight metabolites released by cells into the culture medium. We anticipate that a full comprehension of the catabolism of radiolabeled antibodies by tumor cells will make possible the development of clinical interventions which will enhance the retention of radioimmunoconjugates by hematologic malignancies and improve the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy.
