Keeping in view the fact that molecular basis of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is poorly understood, we attempted to explore the small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated c-myc gene regulation using BL-derived EB-3 cell line as archetype cellular model. Such a study revealed that EB-3 cells possess 4-fold higher expression of Dicer gene coupled with 2-fold higher activity of RNA polymerase III than that observed in normal human lymphocytes. siRNAs derived from EB-3 cells had the inherent capacity to suppress c-myc gene expression in normal cells but not in native cells. Based on these findings we have proposed a novel RNA-mediated c-myc gene regulation pathway that may be responsible for BL.
