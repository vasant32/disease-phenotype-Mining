A 31-year-old male patient presented with a rapidly growing neck mass with normal thyroid function tests. Ultrasonography showed thyroidal expansion, a hypoechoic nodule that completely filled the right lobe, and 2 hypoechoic lymphadenopathies in the right jugulodigastric chain. The patient underwent right total and left subtotal thyroidectomy, following the diagnosis of nodular goiter; however, postoperative histopathological evaluation demonstrated primary Burkitt's lymphoma of the thyroid gland. The tumor was staged as stage 1, and R-hyper-CVAD protocol (rituximab, hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone) was administered. The protocol was changed to R-CHOP after 4 cycles due to recurrent grade III/IV cytopenias and febrile neutropenia. The PET-CT scans performed after chemotherapy and at the 6-month follow-up were normal. In summary, we reported a case with a diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma, which is a rare type of primary thyroid lymphoma.
