The receptor for human interleukin-9 (hIL-9) might be a target for selective immunotherapy. It is expressed on a variety of malignant cells, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We therefore constructed a new chimeric toxin by fusing hIL-9-cDNA to modified Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ETA'). The binding properties of the new recombinant protein, rhIL-9-ETA', were assessed on different cell lines expressing the hIL-9 receptor. The antitumor potency of rhIL-9-ETA' was evaluated against the Hodgkin-derived cell lines L540Cy, KM-H2 and L1236, the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Daudi, the erythroleukemia cell line K562, and the mastocytoma cell line P815-hIL9R, transfected with hIL-9 receptor cDNA. Recombinant hIL-9-ETA' exhibited potent specific cytotoxic effects against P815-hIL9R, K562 and L1236 cells, inhibiting protein synthesis by 50% (IC50) at concentrations of 0.05, 0.58 and 3 micrograms/ml respectively. The cytotoxic effect was abrogated after addition of polyclonal antibodies against the human IL-9. rhIL-9-ETA' might be of potential use against hIL-9R-expressing malignancies.
