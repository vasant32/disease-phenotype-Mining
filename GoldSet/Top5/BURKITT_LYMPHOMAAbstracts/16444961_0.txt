A 53-year-old male was admitted because of pancytopenia and chronic subdural hematoma. Bone marrow was hypercellular with 97% blasts, which expressed CD10, CD19, CD20, and immunoglobulin mu and gamma chains on the cell surface and had chromosomal abnormalities including t(8 ; 22)(q24 ; q11). The patient was diagnosed as having Burkitt leukemia. Because hemiplegia and disturbance of consciousness developed rapidly, the patient was treated with an emergency drainage operation followed by Hyper-CVAD therapy and achieved a sustained complete remission. Dural infiltration of leukemic cells as well as thrombocytopenia was implicated in the pathogenesis of the subdural hematoma, which contained numerous blasts.
