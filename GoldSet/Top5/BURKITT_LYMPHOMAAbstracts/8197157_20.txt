LR1 is a 106-kDa sequence-specific DNA-binding protein first identified as a potential regulator of immunoglobulin class switch recombination in B lymphocytes. Here we report that LR1 binds to a site 310 nt upstream of the human c-myc P1 promoter. Mutation of this site decreases reporter gene expression 5.5-fold in the Burkitt lymphoma line Raji and 3.8-fold in the lymphoma line BJAB. These experiments show that LR1 can function as a transcription factor and identify it as a cell type-specific activator of c-myc expression. There are multiple matches to the LR1 recognition consensus at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus and at c-myc, which further suggests that LR1 may play a dual role, facilitating c-myc translocation as well as regulating c-myc transcription.
