An 11-year-old girl was diagnosed as B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with co-expression of myeloid antigens. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a near-triploid (75-82 chromosomes/cell) abnormal chromosomal complement. Fluroscent in situ hybridization studies indicated presence of TEL/AMLI fusion genes. We discuss the prognostic relevance of TEL/AML1 in this rare near-triploid subtype of ALL.
