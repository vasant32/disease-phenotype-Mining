A new two-step high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedure has been developed to separate modified histone H1 subtypes. Reversed-phase (RP) HPLC followed by hydrophilic-interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) was used for analytical and semi-preparative scale fractionation of multi-phosphorylated H1 histone subtypes into their non-phosphorylated and distinct phosphorylated forms. The HILIC system utilizes the weak cation-exchange column PolyCAT A and an increasing sodium perchlorate gradient in a methanephosphonic acid-triethylamine buffer (pH 3.0) in the presence of 70% (v/v) acetonitrile. The identity and purity of the individual histone subfractions obtained was assayed by capillary electrophoretic analysis. The results demonstrate that application of the combined RP-HPLC-HILIC procedure to the analysis and isolation of modified H1 histone subtypes provides an innovative and important alternative to traditional separation techniques that will be extremely useful in studying the biological function of histone phosphorylation.
