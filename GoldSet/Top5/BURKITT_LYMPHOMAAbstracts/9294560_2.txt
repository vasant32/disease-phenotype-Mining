Two cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), one AIDS related, with hepatic involvement manifesting as infiltrating mass-like periportal intrahepatic low attenuation on CT are described. One case demonstrated mass effect with compression of adjacent bile ducts causing jaundice. NHL should be included in the differential diagnosis of mass-like periportal intrahepatic low attenuation lesions.
