We have established human B-lineage (BLIN) acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines that retain a dependency on fibroblast monolayers for survival and proliferation. Eight hours following removal from adherent cell contact BLIN cells undergo a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and an increase in annexin V binding. Unexpectedly, the caspase-9 inhibitor (C9i) benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-fluoromethylketone enhanced the appearance of apoptotic cells within 8 hours following removal of BLIN cells from fibroblast monolayers. C9i enhancement of apoptosis was dose dependent and did not occur with irreversible inhibitors of caspases-2, -3, -6, and -8. C9i also enhanced apoptosis in cord blood-derived CD19(+) B-lineage cells (but not myeloid cells) removed from murine stromal cells. Longer exposure (> 18 hours) to C9i culminated in apoptosis in a panel of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines in the presence or absence of fibroblast monolayers, as well as in 2 proliferating leukemic cell lines (RAMOS and CEM). BLIN-4L cells made deficient in caspase-9 by RNA interference exhibited no resistance to apoptotic signals and actually showed increased apoptotic sensitivity to staurosporine. These collective results suggest that a 4-amino acid caspase inhibitor of caspase-9 can promote apoptosis and that at least some types of apoptotic pathways in B-lineage ALL do not require caspase-9.
