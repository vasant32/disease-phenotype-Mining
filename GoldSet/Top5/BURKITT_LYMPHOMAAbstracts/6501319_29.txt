Human interferons induce a protein of 15,000 daltons in human and bovine cells. This protein is located in the cytoplasm in a soluble form and is induced by concentrations of interferon which induce the antiviral state. Messenger RNA prepared from interferon-treated human and bovine cells contains a mRNA which yields on translation in vitro a protein similar in size to the 15-kDa protein induced by interferon in vivo. The human protein has been purified to homogeneity from interferon-treated human cells by ion-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. A comparison of the peptides generated by V8 protease from the human and bovine 15-kDa proteins reveals that the two proteins are similar but not identical.
