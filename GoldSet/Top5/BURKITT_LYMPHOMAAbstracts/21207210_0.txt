Classical Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia (BL/L) presenting L3 morphology is found in 1% of childhood ALL. Recently, it has been described that secondary abnormalities could influence the prognosis of these patients. However, little information is available on these cytogenetic abnormalities and their prognostic importance in BL/L. Here, we report four new childhood BL/L cases associated with duplication within 1q or 13q, which exhibited a very unfavorable therapeutic response. We performed both classical and molecular cytogenetic analysis by multicolor chromosome banding of the secondary abnormalities involving the long arms of chromosome 1 or 13. These patients were previously treated with BFM-90 protocol. All of them died during or after the initial treatment. Here, for the first time, the exact breakpoints of the derivative chromosomes involved were determined at the cytogenetic level as 1q21 and 13q33 each.
