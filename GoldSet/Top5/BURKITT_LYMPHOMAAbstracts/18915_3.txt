Three non-productive human lymphoblastoid cell lines, NC-37, RAJI and L-1, either superinfected with Epstein-Barr (EB) virus from P3HR-1 cells or treated with 5-iododexyuridine (IUDR), were studied for the development of early antigen (EA) of EB virus. In all three superinfected cell lines, both the restricted (R) and diffuse (D) componets of EA were synthesized, with R-component formation preceding D-component synthesis. After IUDR treatment both components of EA were only formed in RAJI cells, while in NC37 and L-1 cells only the R-component was synthesized.
