An RNA duplex unwindase activity has been found by using an in vitro assay with various types of mammalian, somatic cells, including HeLa, mouse plasmacytoma, and Burkitt lymphoma. The unwindase activity is very low in mouse fibroblast 3T3 cells arrested into quiescence, but increases when the cells are released into renewed growth by serum. In addition, a gel retardation assay proved to be specific and sensitive for detection of RNA duplex-unwindase complexes.
