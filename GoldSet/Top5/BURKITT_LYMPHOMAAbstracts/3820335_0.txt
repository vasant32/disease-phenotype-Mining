Approximately 25 new cases of American Burkitt's lymphoma (ABL) are diagnosed and reported yearly. Black patients presenting with ABL occur in less than 5 percent of the reported cases. A 47-year-old black man with ABL and ileocecal masses typical of the disease is presented. Symptoms, physical findings, and radiologic features of the disease are assessed. The combined modality of aggressive surgical extirpation and chemotherapy may improve remission and survival time by reduction of tumor burden.
