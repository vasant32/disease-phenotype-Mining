The main immunological elements that control infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 include interferon, NK cells, and specific T and B cells. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of Namalwa cells (B cell immortalized by EBV) which produce IFN alpha in large amount on inhibition of HSV-1 replication in CV-1 and MDBK cells. Inhibition of HSV-1 replication was measured by MTT assay. Addition Namalwa cells to CV-1 or MDBK cells infected HSV-1 inhibited virus replication. Degree of inhibition was connected with amount of added cells and with time of addition (before infection or after infection). The highest inhibition of HSV-1 replication showed Namalwa cells added one hour before infection (72% for CV-1 infected HSV-1 and 68% for MDBK infected HSV-1).
