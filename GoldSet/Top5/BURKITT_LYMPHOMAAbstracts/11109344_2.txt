BACKGROUND: 47 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were studied retrospectively to determine their marrow and blood changes at diagnosis. METHODS: The blood counts, blood films, marrow smears, trephine and tissue biopsies of patients at diagnosis were reviewed. The scheme proposed by the International Lymphoma Study Group (REAL) was utilised for lymphoma subclassification. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: 21.3% had lymphoblastic lymphoma, 21.3% had peripheral T-cell lymphoma (unspecified), 29.8% had diffuse large B-cell NHL, 10.6% had Burkitt's lymphoma and 17% had others. The incidences of anaemia, one or more abnormal counts, lymphocytopenia, increased marrow reticulin and marrow eosinophilia at diagnosis were 66%, 85.1%, 41.3%, 40.9% and 44.7% respectively. Marrow involvement was present in 46.8% of the patients, with diffuse infiltration noted in 71.4% of these cases. Abnormal counts and anaemia were common in all the NHL subtypes. In lymphoblastic lymphoma, the common haematological abnormalities were peripheral atypical lymphocytes and diffuse marrow involvement. In peripheral T-cell lymphoma (unspecified), common features were peripheral lymphocytopenia, increased marrow reticulin and eosinophilia. In diffuse large B-cell NHL, peripheral lymphocytopenia, peripheral myeloid precursors and/or nucleated red cells and marrow involvement were common. In Burkitt's lymphoma, diffuse marrow involvement and eosinophilia were common. No significant differences were noted between most of the haematological parameters of B and T-NHLs. In comparison with other reports, we recorded higher overall incidences of anaemia and diffuse marrow involvement, and a lower incidence of marrow infiltration in peripheral T-cell lymphoma (unspecified).
