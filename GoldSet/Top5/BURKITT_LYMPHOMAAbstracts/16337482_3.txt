RFXAP is required for the transcriptional regulation of MHC-II genes. Mutations in RFXAP are the genetic basis for complementation group D cases of the bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) immunodeficiency. Comparative genomic sequence analysis was conducted and found that only the C-terminal half of the protein is conserved among vertebrates. The C-terminal third of RFXAP, which contained an extensive glutamine-rich tract, could rescue HLA-DR, but not HLA-DQ or HLA-DP expression in a BLS cell line. To understand this phenomenon, a detailed analysis of the role of specific sequences in the C-terminal third of RFXAP with respect to MHC-II regulation was undertaken. Surprisingly, mutation of the conserved glutamine residues had no effect on activity, whereas mutation of hydrophobic and other conserved residues resulted in discoordinate MHC-II isotype expression. Moreover, mutation of potential phosphorylation sites abolished RFXAP activity. The ability of RFXAP mutants to rescue one isotype, but not another was investigated by their ability to form RFX complexes, bind DNA in vivo, recruit CIITA to promoters and to activate a series of chimeric reporter genes. The results suggest that certain RFXAP mutants exaggerate isotype promoter-specific differences and form transcriptionally inefficient activation complexes with factors at the neighboring cis-acting elements. These results show a distinction in factor recognition that is associated with specific MHC-II isotypes and may explain the basis of allele-specific expression differences.
