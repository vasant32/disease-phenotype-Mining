The enzymatic activities of three lymphoblastoid cell lines were subjected to a comparative analysis of 22 enzymatic activities with a new microtechnique "Apizym". This method is easy, requires only a small number of cells and allows simultaneous testing of many enzymatic activities from the same sample. The three cell lines can be easily distinguished despite their close origin: NAB, derived from a malignant retroperitoneal mass in an American patient, is the cell line with the greatest total activity and HRlK (a clone of P3J, derived from an African lymphoma) with the lowest and RAJI (a non-virus producing line derived from an African lymphoma) being the intermediate. The more striking differences concern the activity of phosphatases (NAB greater than RAJI greater than or equal to HRlK), esterases-lipases (NAB greater than or equal to RAJI greater than HRlK), beta glucosaminidase, beta glucuronidase beta glucosidase (NAB greater than or equal to RAJI greater than HRlK). On the other hand, alpha mannosidase and alpha fucosidase are more active in RAJI (RAJI greater than NAB greater than or equal to HRlK).
