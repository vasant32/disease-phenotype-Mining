Serine 70 in the loop region of Bcl-2 is specifically phosphorylated by paclitaxel-treatment in tumor cells and BHK cells expressing Bcl-2. The phosphorylation of serine 70 of Bcl-2 (pS70-Bcl-2) peaks 24 to 48 h after paclitaxel treatment and accelerates apoptosis. Phosphorylation is effectively inhibited in the presence of actinomycin D or cycloheximide, which restore cell viability to the same level as control cells not expressing Bcl-2. These results indicate that paclitaxel-induced kinase(s) and/or its activator(s) are synthesized de novo and play an important role in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis by phosphorylating Bcl-2. In binding assays using the phosphorylation-specific antibody against pS70-Bcl-2, the induction of serine 70 phosphorylation 70 results in a loss of the binding ability of Bcl-2 to Bax, a pro-apoptotic partner, and induces subsequent cell death. When the pS70-Bcl-2 antibody was added to human breast cancer tissue, serine 70 phosphorylation was also detected, even prior to treatment with anticancer agents. Further study of breast cancers revealed 83% of tumors with high pS70-Bcl-2 expression responded to paclitaxel or docetaxel treatment, whereas 57% of those with low expression not respond. These findings suggest that pS70-Bcl-2 might be a predictive factor for prognosis and sensitivity to paclitaxel treatment for breast cancer.
