One of six white-lipped marmosets inoculated with cell-free B95-8 virus developed diffuse malignant lymphoma. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA was detected in a pathologically enlarged mandibular lymph node by DNA-DNA hybridization. The affected animal at the time of killing had EBV antibody titers of 1:320 for viral capsid antigen (VCA) and 1:20 for early antigen (EA) while all non-diseased animals had less than or equal to 1:80 VCA antibody and no detectable EA antibody. This is the first report of lymphoma development in a white-lipped marmoset following EBV inoculation.
