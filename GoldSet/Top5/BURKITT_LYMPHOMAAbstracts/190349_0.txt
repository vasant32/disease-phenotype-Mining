A method was established to obtain a high yield of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA for nucleic acid hybridization studies on latent virus DNA in transformed cells. Superinfection of Raji cells with EBV concentrated from HRI cell cultures produced a 600-fold higher yield of EBV DNA than direct isolation of EBV from HRI cell cultures. The virus DNA thus prepared from Raji cells superinfected with EBV was radioisotopically and spectrophotometrically pure and served as a satisfactory template for the preparation of cRNA specific to EBV DNA.
