BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Molecular genetic abnormalities have been frequently described in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). These lesions have been associated with specific entities, allowing a better categorization of NHL. However, these abnormalities are not as specific as initially described and their association is still unknown. DESIGN AND METHODS: By Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction, we have simultaneously analyzed the proto-oncogenes Bcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-6, c-myc and MLL and the tumor suppressor genes p53 and p16, in 100 unselected B-cell NHL patients at diagnosis, to establish its incidence throughout the different NHL subtypes, defined both by Working Formulation and REAL classifications, and to assess the frequency of co-existence of two or more genetic lesions within each individual patient. RESULTS: Fifty two cases displayed some genetic abnormality. Bcl-1, altered in 12 cases, was highly specific to mantle cell lymphomas (57% of them), but 6 cases had a different histologic subtype. Bcl-2 was rearranged in 26 cases: 70% in follicular lymphomas (FL) and 20% in diffuse large cell lymphomas; these abnormalities were also present in other subtypes, i.e. marginal lymphomas (30%). Bcl-6 abnormalities were mostly found in diffuse large cell lymphomas (29%) but also found in other subgroups, like FL (14%). C-myc rearrangements were specific to Burkitt's lymphoma. MLL gene was always germline. Deletions and/or rearrangements of p53 and p16 genes were rare (4% and 8% of all cases, respectively). Finally, association of genetic lesions was a relatively common finding (13% of cases), especially in cases with adverse prognostic morphologies according to the REAL. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Molecular abnormalities are frequent in NHL at diagnosis, not only as unique lesions but also associated. A relative high specificity of some alterations was seen, thereby contributing to a better assessment of the histological subtype.
