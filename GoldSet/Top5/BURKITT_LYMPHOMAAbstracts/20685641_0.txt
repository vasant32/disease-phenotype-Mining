In this retrospective study, we analysed rare localisations of Burkitt lymphoma observed in the Haematology Department of the University Hospital of Yopougon Abidjan. Over a 10-year study period, we saw 106 patients with Burkitt lymphoma, 21 with unusual localisations. The mean age at onset of symptoms or discovery was 15.48 years, and more patients were female. There were 8 cases of primary Burkitt lymphoma in a rare localisation and 13 cases of unusual localisations of secondary lymphomas. The most frequent of these rare lesions were renal (6), ovarian (4), in peripheral nodes (4), testicular (3), and mammary (3). Still rarer were thyroid, skin, pulmonary, and suprarenal localisations. Clinical manifestations were non-specific and difficult to differentiate from other solid tumours. The CMA protocol produced complete remission in 29% of cases (n=6). Seven patients died. In conclusion, the rare forms of Burkitt lymphoma are non-specific and can be mistaken for other solid tumours. Diagnosis should thus be based on histochemical analysis.
