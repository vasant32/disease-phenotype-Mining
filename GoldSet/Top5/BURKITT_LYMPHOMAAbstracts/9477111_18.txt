BACKGROUND: Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) accounts for 1-2% of all cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in the general population and for 35-40% in the setting of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The authors report a 9-year single-institution experience with 75 adult BL patients (46 with and 29 without HIV infection) and compare the clinical and pathologic features of the disease in the two groups of patients. METHODS: Between May 1987 and June 1995, 131 patients with HIV infection and systemic NHL were diagnosed and treated at the National Cancer Institute in Aviano, Italy. In 46 cases (35%), the diagnosis was BL. During the same period, 29 of 1004 HIV negative NHL patients (2.8%) were diagnosed with BL and treated at the same institution. RESULTS: No statistical differences were found in the general characteristics of the two groups at the time that BL was diagnosed. Complete response rate was significantly lower for patients with HIV infection than for those without HIV infection (40% vs. 65%, P = 0.03). The median overall survival was significantly shorter for patients with HIV infection (7 months vs. not yet reached, P = 0.0001). However, the disease free survival (DFS) at 4 years was identical for the two groups of patients (74% for HIV positive patients vs. 73% for HIV negative patients, P = 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: The data from this study show that patients with BL with and without HIV infection share similar clinicopathologic characteristics at presentation. Although the median overall survival is significantly shorter for patients with HIV infection, the DFS is identical for both groups.
