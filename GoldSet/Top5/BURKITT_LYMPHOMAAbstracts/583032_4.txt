From the therapuetic point of view, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas can be classified into two groups: favourable prognosis histology (DWDL, NWDL, NPDL, and NM) and unfavourable prognosis histology (DPDL, DM, DH, NH, DU). The latter group also includes lymphoblastic lymphoma (T cell) and Burkitt's lymphoma (B cell). Further classification by immunological markers (T, B, monocyte, null cell) and functional categories (T-cell subsets) may reveal prognostic groups which require separate consideration. Intensive chemotherapy of unfavourable histoligies can result in long-term disease-free survival as reported in several series. It would appear that the 10 year survival rates will not differ greatly between several multi-drug regimens. At the present time, the histopathological subtype permits selection of patients for a trial of intensive chemotherapy. The progress in the future will be made with improved techniques for the management of bulky abdominal disease and central nervous system invasion. Although the above may result in some statistical improvement in survival of the unfavourable group, the vast majority of patients with favourable histology lymphoma require new approaches. These may take the form of treatment with immunological manoeuvres such as idiotypic-specific antibodies and/or the use of intensive chemotherapy, especially when there is convincing evidence of a change in the biology of the disease.
