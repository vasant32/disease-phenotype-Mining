Soybean agglutin (SBA) is a plant lectin that has been used to fractionate bone marrow cells. It binds bone marrow mononuclear cells, including mature myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid cells, but has very low binding affinity and no toxic effect to the human hematopoietic cells.

SBA is of vast importance to the field of clinical bone marrow transplantation.
