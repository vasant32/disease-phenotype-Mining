Effects of thymosin fraction 5 on T-lymphocyte rosette formation in vitro were assessed in fourteen patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, twenty-one with Burkitt's lymphoma, thirteen with Hodgkin's disease and fifteen with breast cancer. Thymosin was found to cause a significant increase in T-lymphocyte rosette formation in patients with Burkitt's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease but not in those with hepatocellular carcinoma and cancer of the breast. The significance of these results is discussed.
