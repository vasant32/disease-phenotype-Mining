Karyotype analysis using the Tri-staining-technique (Chromomycin A3/Distamycin A/DAPI) and subsequent DAPI/AMD staining (Schweizer, 1981) was performed on the bone marrow and peripheral blood of three patients with "Burkitt-like" acute lymphatic leukaemia (FAB: L3). In two patients we found the specific translocation t(8;22). One patient displayed in addition a structural abnormality of chromosome 9, visualized with C-banding using the DA/DAPI stain, and in two patients we found specific abnormalities of chromosome 1. Several patterns of the abnormal chromosome 1 revealed an intercalated DA/DAPI positive C-band in the elongated long arm.
