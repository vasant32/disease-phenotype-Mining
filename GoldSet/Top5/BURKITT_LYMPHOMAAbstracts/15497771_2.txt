Bone marrow morphology is frequently abnormal in patients with AIDS. In this study, we reviewed 97 bone marrow biopsies of AIDS patients performed between 1998 and 2000 in the Em√≠lio Ribas Institute of Infectology, which is the reference department for HIV. Specific diagnoses were performed in 33 cases. Fungi were observed in eight cases. Five of them were Histoplasma capsulatum, two were Cryptococcus neoformans, and one probably Candida albicans. Acid-fast bacilli were observed in 12 bone marrow biopsies, three of which were diagnosed to have no mycobacteriosis clinically. Foci of necrosis with clusters of macrophages without any well-formed granuloma were observed in nine cases and well-formed granuloma in three cases. Lymphomatous infiltration was observed in four cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and in two Hodgkin's diseases (mixed cellularity). Extensive necrosis of bone marrow was observed in one case of Burkitt's lymphoma. In conclusion, bone marrow biopsy should be performed to elucidate the etiology of cytopenias, secondary infections, and fever of undetermined origin in AIDS patients.
