In synchronized human lymphoid cell lines, production of immunoglobulins G and M is greatest during the late Gl and S phases of the cell cycle. Little immunoglobulin appears immediately before, during, and immediately after mitosis. The results indicate that transcription of immunoglobulin genes takes place during a limited part of the mitotic cycle.
