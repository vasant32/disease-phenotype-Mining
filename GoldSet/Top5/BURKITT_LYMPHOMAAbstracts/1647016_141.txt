Cryostat sections from lymph nodes of 47 Hodgkin disease patients were examined by immunohistology for the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent membrane protein (LMP), nuclear antigen 2, and late viral glycoprotein gp350/250. A distinct LMP-specific membrane and cytoplasmic staining was detected exclusively in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells in 18 patients (38%); EBV nuclear antigen 2 and gp350/250 immunoreactivity was absent in all instances. Thirty-two of 47 (68%) cases contained EBV-specific DNA sequences as detected by PCR, all LMP-positive cases being in this category. Our results confirm previous studies establishing the presence of EBV genomes in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells by demonstrating expression of an EBV-encoded protein in the tumor-cell population. The finding of LMP expression in the absence of EBV nuclear antigen 2 suggests a pattern of EBV gene expression different from that of B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and Burkitt lymphoma, whereas this finding shows similarities with that seen in undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Because the LMP gene has transforming potential, our findings support the concept of a pathoetiological role of EBV in many cases of Hodgkin disease.
