Reinfusion of undetected tumour cells is a possible cause of relapse after autologous bone-marrow transplantation. In this paper, a system for in-vitro purging of bone marrow is presented which involves the B-cell neoplasia-associated monoclonal antibody anti-Y 29/55 and complement. Five patients with Burkitt's lymphoma were transplanted with purged marrow, demonstrating the clinical feasibility of the method. The pretransplant regimen included vincristine 2 mg/m2, adriamycin 60 mg/m2, four doses of cyclophosphamide 45 mg/kg and total body irradiation with 6 Gy. Tumour control appears to be better in patients with purged bone marrow as compared to an earlier patient group with unpurged marrow.
