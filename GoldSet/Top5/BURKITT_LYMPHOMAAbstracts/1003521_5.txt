The massive amounts of beta-aminoisobutyric acid (beta-AIBA) in the urine of Burkitt's lymphoma patients were measured along with other alpha-amino acids and beta-alanine present in normal and decreased levels. The ratios of the amount of beta-AIBA to beta-alanine, in mumoles/kg urine collected in 24 hours, were elevated for all patients. The degree of elevation of beta-AIBA excretion and the ratio of the two beta-amino acids appeared to be related to the amount of tumor mass present. These analyses may have possible value in monitoring patients with Burkitt's lymphoma during their disease course.
