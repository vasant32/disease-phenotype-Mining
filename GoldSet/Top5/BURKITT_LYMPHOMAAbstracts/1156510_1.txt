The ultrastructure of two lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from Marek's disease lymphomata has been studied. The cells varied from 5 to 12 mum in diameter and had large round or oval nuclei. A nucleolus was occasionally present and about 3% of cells showed projections of the nuclear envelope. The cytoplasm contained many ribosomes and several mitochondria but endoplasmic reticulum was sparse. A small number of cells contained annulate lamellae and crystalline structures were occasionally seen. Cells with immature intranuclear herpesvirus particles were rarely present. The cells had many ultrastructural features in common with Burkitt's lymphoma-derived cell lines.
