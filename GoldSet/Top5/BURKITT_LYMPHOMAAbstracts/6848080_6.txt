Oligoclonal IgG bands were detected in CSF from 12 of 13 patients with African Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) who exhibited neurologic signs or symptoms of CNS involvement. Twenty-three of 26 patients free of neurologic involvement with this tumor were found to lack the oligoclonal IgG bands in their CSF. None of six patients with non-BL included in this study had these bands in their CSF. None of six patients with non-BL included in this study had these bands in their CSF samples. These findings suggest that detection of these bands may be a useful adjunct for determining the presence of African BL that invades the CNS.
