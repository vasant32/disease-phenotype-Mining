The aim of the multicentric trial LALA87 was to test the efficacy of different postremission therapies in adults (15 to 60 year olds) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). An immunologic subclassification based on surface marker expression was proposed. Among the 562 tested patients, 511 were assigned either to the B lineage (361 cases, 63%) or to the T lineage (150 cases, 26%). T-ALL were significantly associated with male sex, age less than 35 years, mediastinal mass, central nervous system involvement, high white blood cell count, and low anemia. In a univariate and multivariate analysis, T-cell leukemia had a more favorable outcome than B-cell leukemia with respective median disease-free survivals (DFSs) of 28 and 14 months (P < .005). However, the type of postremission therapy modifies the value of the immunophenotype prognostic factor. In the chemotherapy arm, T-ALL patients (26 patients) had a more favorable outcome than B-ALL patients (57 patients) (P < .003). In the autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) arm, the apparent better outcome of T-ALL patients (35 T/50 B) did not reach statistical significance (P = .2) and there was no difference in the allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) arm (37 T/71 B: P = .9). In the B-cell-lineage leukemias, subclassification by stages and myeloid antigen coexpression (10%) were not associated with different prognosis. CD10+ T-ALL (31 patients) were associated with a better DFS compared with the CD10- T-ALL (73 patients) with respective median DFS, not reached and 18.5 months (P = .04).
