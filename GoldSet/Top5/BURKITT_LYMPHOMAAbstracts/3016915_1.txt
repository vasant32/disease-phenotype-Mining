The American Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Loukes was cotransfected with cloned BamHI K fragment of EBV DNA and a vector pSV2neo. Reconstituted Sendai virus envelopes (RSVE) loaded with DNA were used for efficient gene transfer. Two cell lines have been obtained following culture in the presence of geneticin sulfate (G-418). Messenger RNA from both transfected DNAs was expressed during the whole period of observation, 42 days after transfection. This method provides a relatively simple and efficient means for selection of lymphoblastoid cells expressing a transfected gene.
