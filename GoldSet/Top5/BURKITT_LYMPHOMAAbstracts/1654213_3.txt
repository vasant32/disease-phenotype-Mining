Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) are potent inducers of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC). The contribution of EBV antigens to the induction of cytotoxic responses was investigated by comparing CTL clones derived from allogeneic MLCs of lymphocytes from one EBV seropositive and one seronegative donor for their capacity to lyse paired EBV positive and negative targets. The majority of the clones showed a conventional "HLA-specific" cytotoxicity and lysed equally well HLA-matched LCLs and mitogen-induced T- or B-blasts. A minority of the clones from both donors exhibited an "LCL-selective" killing potential as they lysed poorly T- and B-blasts. The LCL-selective clones did not recognize EBV antigens because they could not discriminate between EBV negative Burkitt lymphoma (BL) lines and their in vitro EBV-converted sublines. MAbs to CD3, CD8, and MHC class I antigens blocked the lysis of LCLs by HLA-specific and LCL-selective CTLs with comparable efficiency suggesting that the two effector types express T-cell receptors of similar affinity. T-blasts were unable to inhibit the lysis of LCLs in cross competition assays. This correlated with a significantly lower expression of the cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and LFA-3. The results suggest that stimulation with allogeneic LCLs activates HLA class I-specific CTLs with variable target cell avidity. Only CTLs that act independently of the enhancing effect of cell adhesion molecules are able to lyse mitogen-induced T- and B-blasts.
