Burkitt lymphoma biopsies and the CSF malignancy have been investigated ultrastructurally. The tumor cells were found to contain vermicellar bodies formed by rod-like structures similar to those suggested to represent HSV nucleoids in HSV encephalities. But, unlike the HSV disease and BL in culture, no nucleocapsids nor empty capsids were detected. It is suggested that the rods in the Burkitt lymphoblasts may well represent EBV nucleoids and that the absence of capsids may be another characteristic of the EBV in BL in situ.
