The authors study the epidemiological conditions of the appearance of Burkitt's disease on the Ivory Coast. This condition represents 4.12% of cancers observed in this country. From a thorough study of the differences in temperature, relative humidity, vapour pressure, hours of sunlight, amount of rainfall, they were able to pick out that equatorial forest zones are more at risk than the savannah zones. The climatic conditions in the forest render intervention by a vector plausible, either directly or indirectly via malaria or other parasitic infestations.
