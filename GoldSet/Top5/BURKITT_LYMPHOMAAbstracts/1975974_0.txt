Antibody reactivity against a synthetic peptide derived from Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) was determined in 56 cases of child non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 31 controls. The patients were divided into subgroups based on tumour location and histology and the antibody responses in the various groups were compared. A significant increase in both IgG and IgM antipeptide titres was detected in patients with tumours localized in the abdomen. High IgG titres were also noted in Burkitt-type, lymphoblastic, and centroblastic lymphomas. On the other hand, low or nil IgG titres were found in unclassified malignant lymphomas, in four cases of centroblastic-centrocytic lymphoma and in lymphomas located in the mediastinum. Surprisingly, the occurrence of antipeptide IgM antibody was highest in those tumours, where IgG titres were low, i.e. in subjects with mediastinal tumours and in unclassified malignant lymphomas. However, with the exception of tumours localized in the abdomen and unclassified tumours, the IgM titres in positive individuals were low and comparable with titres found in a part of healthy controls.
