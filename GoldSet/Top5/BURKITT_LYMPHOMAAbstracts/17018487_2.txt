 BACKGROUND: Burkitt's lymphoma is a rapidly growing and, if untreated, rapidly fatal tumor derived from B-lymphocytes. The occurrence of Burkitt's lymphoma during pregnancy is rare. CASE: A patient with Burkitt's lymphoma presented at 12 weeks of gestation with abdominal and tooth pain. An 11 x 11 x 15 cm mass was seen on abdominal/pelvic ultrasonogram. She underwent a left salpingo-oophorectomy with removal of the mass, as well as a tooth extraction. The pathology examination confirmed lymphoma in the left ovary and in the tissue surrounding the extracted tooth. After surgical resection, she was treated with multiagent chemotherapy beginning at 13 4/7 weeks of gestation. At 39 weeks, she delivered a viable female infant weighing 2,270 g. CONCLUSION: The finding of an adnexal mass in conjunction with head and neck symptoms led to consideration of Burkitt's lymphoma. Prompt treatment with multiagent chemotherapy should be considered for pregnant patients with Burkitt's lymphoma.
