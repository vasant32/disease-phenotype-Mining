A 34-year-old postpartum woman with Burkitt's lymphoma is reported. Lymphoma involved the bilateral breasts chiefly, as well as the brain, ileocecal region and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Fourteen days after bilateral mastectomy, the patient suddenly went into a coma due to rapid progress of brain involvement. However, the coma improved the day after VEPA chemotherapy and radiation were undertaken, and the tumor-involved brain decreased significantly in size following chemoradiotherapy. Chemoradiotherapy produced the almost complete disappearance of the remaining tumor. The patient is now being treated by a maintenance dose of Endoxan and is doing well. Burkitt's lymphoma of the breast in the present case had the clinical characteristics of bilateral involvement with rapid growth arising during lactation and pregnancy.
