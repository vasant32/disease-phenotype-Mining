BACKGROUND: Orbito-ocular neoplasms are important causes of ophthalmic morbidity and mortality. Various reports have shown that they occur more commonly among Africans than Caucasians. In this era of HIV pandemic, an increase in the frequency of AIDS-related orbito-ocular neoplasms has also been reported. OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to determine the pattern of orbito-ocular tumours in Enugu, South-Eastern Nigeria and to compare it with the findings from earlier studies in the same area, other parts of Nigeria and other countries. METHODS: In a retrospective, non-comparative case series study the records of all the cases of orbito-ocular neoplasms seen in the Histopathology departments of the two tertiary multidisciplinary hospitals with major eye clinics in Enugu (ParkLane Specialist and University of Nigeria Teaching Hospitals) between January 2001 and August 2005 were analysed for types of tumours, frequency of occurrence, sex and age of patients. RESULTS: A total of 43 cases were analysed. There were 17 males and 26 females (M: F-l:1.4). Retinoblastoma was the most commonly occurring neoplasm accounting for 25.6% of all the tumours; followed by squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva which was seen in 5 (11.6%) of cases. Squamous papilloma and Burkitt's lymphoma each accounting for 9.3% of the tumours in the series were the third most commonly occurring ones. CONCLUSION: In spite of the limitations of the study our findings suggest that the spectrum of orbito-ocular neoplasms has generally remained the same in Enugu, South-Eastern Nigeria as well as in other parts of the country.
