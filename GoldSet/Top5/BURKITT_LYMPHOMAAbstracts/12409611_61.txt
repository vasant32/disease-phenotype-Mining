The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome has been detected in lymphomas and in tumors of epithelial or mesenchymal origin such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma or leiomyosarcoma. Thus, there is little doubt that EBV can infect cells of numerous lineages in vivo, in contrast to its in vitro infectious spectrum, which appears restricted predominantly to B lymphocytes. We show here that the EBV BALF4 gene product, the glycoprotein gp110, dramatically enhances the ability of EBV to infect human cells. gp110(high) viruses were up to 100 times more efficient than their gp110(low) counterparts in infecting lymphoid or epithelial cells. In addition, gp110(high) viruses infected the carcinoma cell line HeLa and the T cell lymphoma cell line Molt-4, both previously thought to be refractory to EBV infection. Analysis of several virus isolates showed that the amount of BALF4 present within mature virions markedly differed among these strains. In some strains, gp110 was found expressed during lytic replication not only at the nuclear but also at the cellular membrane. Heterologous expression of gp110 during the virus lytic phase neither altered virus concentration nor affected virus binding to cells. It appears that gp110 plays a crucial role after the virus has adhered to its cellular target. gp110 constitutes an important virulence factor that determines infection of non-B cells by EBV. Therefore, the use of gp110(high) viruses will help to determine the range of the target cells of EBV beyond B lymphocytes and provide a useful in vitro model to assess the oncogenic potential of EBV in these cells.
