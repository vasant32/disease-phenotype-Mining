The revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms (REAL), proposed by the International Lymphoma Study Group, contains molecular genetic data which may characterize a given lymphoma entity. In this recent review, the molecular genetic alterations integrated into the diagnostic procedure of lymphomas are discussed. Based on our recent knowledge the rearrangements of bcl-1, bcl-2, bcl-6, anaplastic lymphoma kinase and c-myc genes are associated with mantle cell, diffuse large B-cell, anaplastic large cell and Burkitt's lymphomas, respectively. The integration of the relevant molecular data in the evaluation of objective diagnoses and therefore specific and successful therapies. Furthermore, the knowledge of the molecular event associated with lymphomas helps to better understand tumor development and biology.
