Tumorigenicity of lymphoid cell lines of different origin upon xenotransplantation (s.c. and i.m.) in cell concentrations of 1 X 10(6) cell/inoculum into nude mice was correlated to karyotype, presence of the 14 q + marker, EBV reactivity and immunological markers. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), lacking the 14 q + marker failed to produce tumors independent upon diploidy or aneuploidy. Lymphoma-type lines of Burkitt lymphoma, lymphosarcoma and Hodgkins disease-origin, genotypically aneuploid, and expressing the 14 q + marker were tumorogenic in nude mice, when inoculated in the same cell quantities where LCL failed to form tumors. Tumorgrowth in nude mice was independent upon the presence of EBV in the inoculated cells.
