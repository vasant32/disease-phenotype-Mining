A lymphoid cell system was established that can induce the prompt and synchronous activation of latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes and thus allows the identification of viral genes that are activated sequentially depending on their functions. With this system, we proved that disruption of EBV latency is initiated by activation of four EBV genes and that protein synthesis is not required prior to activation of latent EBV. The system should be an in vitro model for studying the mechanism of herpesvirus latency.
