The respective roles of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and c-myc in the pathogenesis of endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) are unclear. In order to help resolve the question whether constitutive expression of the c-myc gene in an EBV-immortalised B cell is sufficient to induce a tumorigenic phenotype, B cells from a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) were immortalised with EBV, transfected with a constitutively activated c-myc gene and inoculated into the host animals. Despite the cell line transfected with c-myc displaying enhanced growth characteristics, in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that this was not sufficient to induce a tumorigenic phenotype. This supports our previous findings with EBV-immortalised human B cells transfected with an activated c-myc gene (Hotchin et al., 1990).
