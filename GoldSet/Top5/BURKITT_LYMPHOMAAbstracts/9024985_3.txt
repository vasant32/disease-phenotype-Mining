Antibodies to gag-coded proteins of type D retroviruses have been detected in children with lymphadenopathy [1]. We tested 41 HIV noninfected children with lymphoproliferative diseases (27 cases of Burkitt's-type lymphoma, six cases of Hodgkin's disease, four cases of T-cell lymphoma, three cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma and one case of large-cell anaplastic lymphoma) for the presence of type D retroviral serological and genetical markers. Twenty-five healthy donors were tested as a control. DNA samples from peripheral blood lymphocytes were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blotting for the presence of type D retroviral related sequences. MPMV pro-pol specific sequences have been detected in 18 out of 27 children with Burkitt's-type lymphoma. By means of Western blotting, six patients positive in PCR/Southern blotting analysis were also found to contain Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) specific antibodies, in their sera. All children with other lymphoproliferative diseases as well as healthy donors were negative in PCR/Southern blotting and Western blotting analysis. These data suggest the possible association of type D retroviral markers with Burkitt's-type lymphoma of children.
