A total of 233 bone marrow aspirates were obtained from 43 patients with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). Lymphoma cells were absent and lymphoblastoid cell lines could not be established from 197 samples, which were characterized by limited initial cell proliferation and development of an adherent population, followed by cell death after 2-4 weeks. In 14 aspirates, after a similar pattern of growth, cell proliferation began again after about 6 weeks, with a rapid appearance and growth of cell clumps from the feeder layer--a type of growth typical of spontaneous lymphoblastoid cell lines. In 22 aspirates, growth of malignant cells was observed in culture and cytocentrifuged, stained smears, including marrow samples from 9 patients in whom the presence of BL cells had not been ascertained or even suspected by cytology. Karyotypic anomalies characteristic of BL were found in these cells: t(8;14) in the majority, two t(8;22), two t(2;8), and one t(2;8;9).
