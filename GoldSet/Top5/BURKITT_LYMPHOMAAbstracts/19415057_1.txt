There are several pathologies that may cause alteration of the lower lip sensation, therefore a differential diagnosis is needed. Among these pathologies, we have focused on intrabone growing tumours such as Burkitt's Lymphoma. Burkitt's Lymphoma is a malignant tumour of B-Cell lymphocyte origin, classified as a Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Three clinical subtypes are described: endemic, sporadic and HIV associated. It is characterized by very fast growing, undifferentiated lymphocytes and bone marrow infiltration. A high incidence of Burkitt's Lymphoma has been reported in African children. It is known to have a good response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment. This report describes the case of a 29 year-old Spanish man diagnosed with Burkitt's Lymphoma, in which his first and only symptom was bilateral anaesthesia of the lower lip. We have also described the clinical evolution, steps for diagnosis and treatment.
