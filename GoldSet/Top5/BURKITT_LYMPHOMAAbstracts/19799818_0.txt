 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of standard chemotherapy regimen on aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of certain pathologic types is unsatisfied. This study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of modified Hyper-CVAD regimen on Chinese patients with aggressive NHL. METHODS: Clinical records of 31 NHL patients who received modified Hyper-CVAD regimen in Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from June 2004 to June 2008 were analyzed in terms of toxicity and response. RESULTS: The 31 patients totally received 91 cycles of regimen A and 41 cycles of regimen B with a median of 4 cycles (ranged 1-7 cycles). The major toxicity was myelosuppresion: the occurrence rates of neutropenia of grades III-IV, thrombocytopenia and febrile neutropenia were 49.5%, 3.3% and 12.1% during treatment of regimen A, and were 80.5%, 82.9% and 46.3% during treatment of regimen B. No treatment-related death was observed. The responses were assessable in 26 patients. The total response rate was 80.8%, and 12 patients achieved complete response (46.2%). CONCLUSION: Modified Hyper-CVAD regimen is a promising regimen for the patients with intermediate and high grade NHL.
