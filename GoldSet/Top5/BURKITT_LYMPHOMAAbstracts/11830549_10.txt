Members of the BCL2 gene family influence cell viability and can, therefore, affect the susceptibility of cancer cells to multiple chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, it is a challenge to devise approaches for inducing the death of tumor cells in which the expression of prosurvival family members is elevated or deregulated. BL41-3, a spontaneously derived subline of BL41 Burkitt lymphoma cells, was found to have amplified the prosurvival MCL1 gene (3-fold) and overexpressed the MCL1 protein. The level of MCL1 protein was 5-fold elevated compared with ML-1 cells expressing maximal MCL1 on exposure to phorbol-12-myristate-13- acetate. To assess whether this increase in MCL1 expression was associated with enhanced protection from cell death, cells were exposed to conditions of growth factor deprivation or to various cytotoxic agents. Whereas BL41-3 and BL41 cells exhibited similar growth rates in logarithmic phase, BL41-3 cells remained largely viable on reaching saturation phase in contrast to BL41 cells, which began to die. Similarly, the BL41-3 subline remained viable for an extended period under conditions of reduced serum. BL41-3 cells were also more resistant to the apoptosis-inducing effects of etoposide, camptothecin, and staurosporine (>3-fold more than BL41 cells). Unexpectedly, these cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, but only on exposure for an extended period (>10-fold more sensitive than BL41 cells with a 24-h but not a 6-h exposure). Thus, whereas cells expressing prosurvival BCL2 family members are frequently resistant to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, the findings presented here, using a cell line exhibiting amplification and overexpression of MCL1, indicate that such cells may exhibit increased sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic regimens.
