Epstein-Barr virus DNA in virus non-productive cells was separated from high-molecular-weight cell DNA by sedimentation through a neutral glycerol gradient after gentle lysis of cells by Pronase and Sarkosyl. The isolated Epstein-Barr virus DNA had a density of 1.716-1.717 g/cm(3) in CsCl equilibrium centrifugation, which is very close to the virus DNA density of 1.718 g/cm(3). The results indicated that the majority of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in virus nonproductive cells is not covalently integrated into high-molecular-weight cell DNA.
