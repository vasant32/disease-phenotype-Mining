In the present study we have addressed the issue of proteasome independent cytosolic protein degradation. Tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPPII) has been suggested to compensate for a reduced proteasome activity, partly based on evidence using the inhibitor Ala-Ala-Phe-chloromethylketone (AAF-cmk). Here we show that AAF-cmk induces the formation of polyubiquitin-containing accumulations in osteosarcoma and Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. These accumulations meet many of the landmarks of the aggresomes that form after proteasome inhibition. Using a combination of experiments with chemical inhibitors and interference of gene expression, we show that TPPII inhibition is not responsible for these accumulations. Our evidence suggests that the relevant target(s) is/are in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, most likely upstream the proteasome. We obtained evidence supporting this model by inhibition of Hsp90, which also acts upstream the proteasome. Although our data suggest that Hsp90 is not a target of AAF-cmk, its inhibition resulted in accumulations similar to those obtained with AAF-cmk. Therefore, our results question the proposed role for TPPII as a prominent alternative to the proteasome in cellular proteolysis.
