A 6-year-old girl was admitted for cervical lymphadenopathy. She was diagnosed histologically as having Burkitt's lymphoma with partial involvement of follicles. Immunological study of a biopsy specimen demonstrated that many cells were surface immunoglobulin (lambda light chain)-positive, and chromosomal analysis revealed a translocation of (8;14) (q24;q32) in all blastic cells. Her serum antibody titers to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) capsid antigen and to early antigen were 1:320 and 1:160, respectively, and most of the cells from the lymphoma biopsy specimen were EBV-associated nuclear antigen (EBNA)-positive. In addition, EBV DNA/DNA reassociation kinetic analysis showed 22 EBV genome equivalents per cell. Complete remission was obtained by CHOP therapy (consisting of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisolone) combined with cervical irradiation. She is in complete remission now (17 months after the onset).
