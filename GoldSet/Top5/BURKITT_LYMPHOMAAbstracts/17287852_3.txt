The expression of c-myc is deregulated in Burkitt's lymphoma by the translocation t(8;14). Most of the increased c-myc expression is from the P1 promoter, which is normally a minor promoter. How the P1 promoter is activated by the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancers is not understood. We identified a YY1 site in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene HS3 enhancer, which increased c-myc P1 promoter activity, and a MARE site, which decreased c-myc P1 activity. Small Maf proteins bound to the MARE site both in vitro and in vivo, recruited histone deacetylase 2, and resulted in deacetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the c-myc promoter region. In contrast, YY1 recruited CBP and increased histone acetylation at the c-myc promoter. Rb interacts with YY1 to prevent DNA binding in normal B cells, but no significant interaction with YY1 was detected in Burkitt's cells, and binding of YY1 to the HS3 enhancer was observed by chromatin immunoprecipitaton. Increased expression of MafK and/or decreased expression of YY1 by silencing RNA downregulated endogenous c-myc mRNA levels and increased the sensitivity of the cells to doxorubicin. Mutation of the major active sites (nuclear factor-kappa B and YY1) in the enhancers prevented c-myc activation.
