The immunomagnetic depletion method for removing tumor cells from bone marrow, previously refined using a Burkitt lymphoma model, was tested with neuroblastoma cells. The efficiency of depletion was quantified by immunofluorescence with a detection limit of 3.3 log of cell depletion corresponding to the elimination of 99.84% of an initial tumor cell content of 10%. A panel of five monoclonal antibodies (UJ13A; UJ127.11; UJ181.4; alpha-Thy1; H11) purged 2.8 log of SKNBE and LAN-1 cells, while two of these antibodies as single agents allowed only for a 1.7 log (UJ13A) and a 1.7 to 2.0 log (alpha-Thy1) depletion. This underlines the advantage of an antibody panel for neuroblastoma purging. The new antibody S-L 11.14, an IgG2a against small cell lung cancer which recognizes 90% of neuroblastoma cells purged 2.8 log.
