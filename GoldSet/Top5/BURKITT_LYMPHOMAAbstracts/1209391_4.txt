The isolation of an ovine herpesvirus from a cell culture of an adenomatous sheep lung is reported, confirming previous observations of a possible association of a herpesvirus with this tumour. Some growth properties and morphological characteristics of the virus are described, as well as serological data supporting a possible relationship between tumour and virus. Attempts to produce jaagsiekte by intratracheal injection of virus into lambs were unsuccessful, suggesting that a second factor may be involved inthe oncogenic process possibly similar to that proposed for the well-known EBV-Burkitt's lymphoma system.
