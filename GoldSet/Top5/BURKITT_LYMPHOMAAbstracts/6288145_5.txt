A comparative analysis of enzymatic activities has been performed on 47 human continuous lymphoid lines: 22 tumors derived from Burkitt's lymphoma lines, 6 other lymphomatous long-term cultures, and 19 nonmalignant ties determined on the cell extracts. 4 showed no significant differences between the various lines. They included adenosine diphosphoribose incorporation, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, cyclic-AMP phosphodiesterase, and glutathione reductase. However, striking differences of activity were found for the enzyme, NAD(P) glycohydrolase (EC 3.2.2.6). Activity levels were, as a mean, four times higher in Burkitt's lymphoma-derived cell lines than in nonmalignant control lines, and the difference was highly significant (p less than 0.02). All Burkitt cell lines containing translocations of chromosome 8 with either chromosomes 2, 14 or 22 showed an increased activity. The specificity and significance of this possible enzymatic marker of Burkitt's lymphoma cells is discussed.
