Primate and rabbit antisera to different morphologic classes of human leukemia cells, after appropriate absorptions, detected leukemia-associated antigens present on cultured lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from leukemia patients. The primate antisera distinguished antigens on cells derived from myeloid leukemia patients from those on cells derived from lymphocytic leukemia patients. Of particular interest was the fact that antigens of myeloid leukemia, but not of lymphatic leukemia, were detected on lymphoid cell lines established from blood of patients with myeloid leukemia. One of four lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from normal donors expressed antigens of lymphatic leukemia. Leukemia-associated antigens were not found on the HRIK lymphoblastoid line derived from a Burkitt's lymphoma patient on skin fibroblasts or HeLa cells. Expression of these antigens on cultured cells derived from leukemia patients could not be related to the presence of the EB virus or the EB virus genome. Rabbit antisera detected antigens common to cells from patients with myeloid and lymphocytic leukemia. Absorption experiments demonstrated that the antigens detected on cell lines derived from leukemia patients are similar to those detected by the primate and rabbit antisera on fresh peripheral blood leukemic cells. The serologic detection of leukemia-associated antigens on lymphoblastoid cell lines indicates that some of these cultures contain cells with antigenic properties similar to those of human peripheral blood leukemic cells.
