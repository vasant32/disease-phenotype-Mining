To clarify the clinicopathological findings of B-cell lymphoma associated with Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SJS) among Japanese Patients, 15 individuals with this disease were studied. The patients, 14 females and one male, ranged in age from 41 to 73 years with a median age of 56 years. These lymphomas arose not only in the salivary gland (n=4) but also in other mucosal extranodal sites (n=5). Histologically, six cases were marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZBL) of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type, three cases were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) + MALT type lymphoma, two cases were nodal MZBL and one case each was small lymphocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, CD10(+) DLBCL and DLBCL + nodal MZBL. Using in situ hybridization, numerous Epstein-Barr virus(+) tumor cells were detected only in the case of Burkitt lymphoma. There were no human-herpes type 8(+) tumor cells in any of the 15 cases. There was no API2-MALT1 fusion transcript in any of the eight cases examined. B-cell lymphoma associated with SJS also frequently affected extranodal organs in patients from Japan as well as from patients in Western countries. The majority of B-cell lymphomas in patients with SJS also appear to be low-grade MZBLs or high-grade lymphomas probably derived from MZBL both in Western countries and in Japan.
