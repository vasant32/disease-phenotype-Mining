OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of TEL-AML1 fusion gene and its role in clinical diagnosis and prognosis of childhood B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), and to compare the two techniques: nested RT-PCR and dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). METHODS: Nested RT-PCR and dual-color FISH techniques were used to detect TEL-AML1 fusion gene. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: TEL-AML1 fusion transcript was found in 22.5%(9/40) of patients with B-ALL by RT-PCR. The prognosis of these TEL-AML1 positive patients was relatively good and the complete remission rate was 100%. Both RT-PCR and FISH techniques were proved to be useful for detecting TEL-AML1 fusion gene and suitable for clinical diagnosis and prognosis evaluation.
