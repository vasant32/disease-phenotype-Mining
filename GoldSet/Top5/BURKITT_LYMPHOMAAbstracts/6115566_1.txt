Hydrocortisone was capable of enhancing the synthesis of Epstein-Barr virus antigens in producer P3HR-1 cells which had been induced with a 24-hr pulse of 5-iodo-2-deoxy-uridine. The effect of hydrocortisone was time dependent, suggesting that an early step in the induction process, and not the antigen synthesis itself, was influenced by the drug.
