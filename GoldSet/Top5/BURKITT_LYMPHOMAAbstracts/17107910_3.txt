This study reports on the cytogenetic features of a novel case of pediatric Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL), that adds to the three published. Four groups of cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in the present case: (1) imbalances shared by most germinal center (GC) derived B-cell tumors including BLL (+1q, -6q, -8p, +8q24 and +11); (2) imbalances already reported in adult but not in pediatric BLL cases and shared with most GC B-cell tumors (+7, -9p, -9q, +12q, -13q, +17, +19, -3 and -4); (3) imbalances already reported in pediatric but not in adult BLL cases and shared with some GC B-cell tumors (-2q); and (4) imbalances never described before in pediatric or adult BLL, but present in different GC B-cell tumors (-6p, -1p and -18q). In view of the paucity of pediatric BLL cases published, this report adds novel, relevant information on the molecular cytogenetic features of this rare tumor.
