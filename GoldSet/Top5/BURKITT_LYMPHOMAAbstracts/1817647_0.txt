We investigated the basic technology of cell culture conditions for production of useful substances such as cytokines, and related proteins produced by Namalwa cells. Namalwa cells, human B lymphoblastoid cells, were used for large scale production of alpha-interferon. Namalwa KJM-1, a subline of Namalwa cells, adapted to serum- and albumin-free medium, can grow at a high density above 1 x 10(7) cells/ml in suspension manner by the use of a perfusion culture system, Biofermenter, containing a cone-type cell-sedimentation column as cell separator. Several kinds of cytokine cDNA can be introduced and expressed in Namalwa KJM-1 cells. Some of these were produced in large quantities by use of a gene amplification method with dhfr, even through the Namalwa KJM-1 cells contained endogenous dhfr genes. For stable production of the target protein, Namalwa KJM-1 cells are very useful host cells, because they have no effective endogenous protease activity in the conditioned medium. Using Biofermenter with micro-silicone fibers and a dialysis system, the specific productivity of the target proteins was not depressed at a high cell density.
