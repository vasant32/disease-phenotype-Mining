Cell lines derived from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive and EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma (BL) have a low or defective expression of polymorphic HLA class I determinants compared to EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) of normal B cell origin and are resistant to lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for the corresponding determinants (M. G. Masucci, S. Torsteinsdottir, J. Colombani, C. Brautbar, E. Klein, and G. Klein, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 4567, 1987; S. Torsteinsdottir, C. Brautbar, E. Klein, G. Klein, and M. G. Masucci, Int. J. Cancer, 41, 913, 1988). In order to investigate whether this phenotypic trait of the tumor cells can be modulated by agents known to enhance HLA class I antigen expression, pairs of LCL and BL lines were cultured in the presence of recombinant human interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Three low HLA A11 expressor EBV-negative BL lines, DG 75, BL 28, and BL 41, reacted significantly stronger with the anti-HLA A11 monoclonal antibody (Mab) AUF 5.13 after combined treatment with 500 U/ml IFN-gamma and 500 U/ml TNF-alpha. Reactivity with the AUF 5.13 and with other anti-polymorphic class I Mab's was up-regulated also in in vitro EBV-converted sublines of BL 28 and BL 41. The increment of antigen expression depended on the baseline expression in untreated cells. It was largest for the low expressor lines and decreased proportionally to the level of up-regulation induced by EBV conversion. Up-regulation of HLA A11 was accompanied by induction of sensitivity to HLA A11-specific CTLs in BL 28 and its converted subline E95A BL28 while BL 41 and E95A BL 41 remained resistant. The treatment did not affect significantly HLA A11 expression of two EBV-carrying, low HLA A11 expressor BL lines, WW-1-BL and WW-2-BL, and of the EBV-carrying BL 72 line that had a high spontaneous expression. The results suggest that the down-regulation of class I antigen expression is reversible in some but not all BL lines.
