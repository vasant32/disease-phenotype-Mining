Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines carry a translocated c-myc gene and, in 60-80% of cases, exhibit mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. We examined the potential role of the p53 gene in BL tumorigenicity using an in vitro assay that measures p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and an in vivo athymic murine model that detects differences in the tumorigenicity of BL cell lines. A highly significant inverse correlation was found between the ability of BL cells to arrest in G1 after irradiation and their tumorigenicity in athymic mice, consistent with the notion that loss of p53 function is associated with increased tumorigenicity. Inactivation of wild-type (wt) p53 function by expression of the human papillomavirus E6 protein in the AG876V BL cell line, which carries both wt and mutant p53 proteins, rendered the cell line significantly more tumorigenic in athymic mice. Transfection of the wt p53 gene into the p53 mutant and highly tumorigenic BL-41 cell line caused it to acquire wt p53 function and rendered it less tumorigenic in mice. In addition to confirming a role for the loss of p53 function in tumor progression, the data demonstrate that wt p53 protein can reduce BL tumorigenicity in vivo.
