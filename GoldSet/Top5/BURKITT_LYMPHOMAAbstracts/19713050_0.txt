Patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome are at high risk for development of lymphomas, which are predominantly extranodal and of the immunoblastic type. We present a case of a self-limited lymphoproliferation with features of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma arising in a patient with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. The patient also had stigmata of von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis. The tumor was composed of CD138+, IgGkappa+, CD20-, PAX-5- Mott cells and CD5-, CD10-, CD19+, CD20+, CD43- small lymphoid B-cells that partially expressed CD23. The lymphadenopathy spontaneously resolved after a period of less than a year, and the patient had remained free of detectable lymphoproliferation for almost 4 years. He then developed Burkitt's lymphoma of the left parapharyngeal space. It is remarkable that both known lymphoproliferations with features of lymphoplasmatic lymphoma arising in patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, this one and the previously described one, have spontaneously resolved. This observation is truly intriguing and requires further clinico-pathologic studies.
