Musculoskeletal pain is a frequent complaint in pediatrics usually related to benign conditions. However, it may also represent the initial symptom of serious diseases such as infections, malignancies or orthopedic emergencies. We present the case of a child diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma whose initial presentation was a limp. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first case reported in the literature with this type of debut. This case illustrates the importance of including neoplasms in the differential diagnosis of atypical musculoskeletal pain, since early diagnosis can significantly improve their prognosis.
