Leukemic and lymphomatous involvement of the appendix is rare and even rarer is its presentation as appendicitis. Burkitt's lymphoma is a high grade B-cell neoplasm. Its non-endemic form typically presents as abdominal mass in children. This rapidly growing tumour may cause symptoms due to mass effect or direct involvement of the bowel. Clinical presentations like acute abdomen can be secondary to intestinal obstruction, intussusception or sometimes perforation.We describe here a case of an adult male with an unusual presentation of appendiceal Burkitt's lymphoma mimicking acute cholecystitis or appendicitis.
