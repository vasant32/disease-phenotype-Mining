As the effects of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2-D3) (VD, calcitriol) on the proliferation and differentiation potential of normal and leukaemic cells in vitro of myeloid lineage are known, we investigated the response to VD on the growth of both normal and malignant lymphoid progenitors. Effects of vitamin D on normal human lymphoid progenitors and B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) progenitors were assessed by using an in vitro cell colony assay specific for either B or T cell lineages. The expression of VDR on B untreated malignant progenitors at diagnosis was investigated by RT-PCR analysis. VD induced a significant inhibition of normal lymphoid cell progenitors growth of both T and B lineage. VD inhibited significantly also the growth of malignant B cell lineage lymphoid progenitors, without inducing cytotoxic effect. As it has been reported that VD effects on activated lymphocytes are mediated by 1,25-(OH)2-D3 nuclear receptor (VDR), we investigated VDR expression on malignant B cell progenitors. We did not detect VDR expression on these cells examined at diagnosis. We demonstrated that VD inhibited in vitro the clonogenic growth of both normal and malignant lymphoid B cell progenitors and that this inhibitory effect on malignant B cell progenitors was not related to VDR. Our work contributes to understanding of the mechanism of action of this hormone in promoting cellular inhibition of clonal growth of malignant lymphoid B cell progenitors, suggesting that the regulation of some critical growth and differentiation factor receptors could be a key physiological role of this hormone.
