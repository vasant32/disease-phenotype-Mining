An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using micro-titre plates has been established for determination of IgG and IgA antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated early antigen complex (EA) and the viral capsid antigen (VCA). The results obtained correlated well with the antibody titre determinations by the standard immunofluorescence technique. The ELISA was found to be about 15 to 30 times more sensitive than the immunofluorescence assay. Because of its high sensitivity, specificity and rapid performance the enzyme-immunoassay is a useful tool for large scale epidemiological studies of EBV-associated diseases as well as for the early diagnosis and monitoring of patients with EBV-associated tumours: Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. IgG and IgA antibody titres to EA and VCA were determined in sera obtained from healthy controls, patients with EBV-associated tumours, infectious mononucleosis and various diseases known to be associated with EBV-reactivation, i.e. lymphomas and leukaemias. Except in sera of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, IgA antibodies to VCA and EA could only be detected at a rather high frequency (36% IgA anti-VCA+, 21% IgA anti-EA+) and in substantial titres in sera obtained from patients with chronic lymphatic leukaemia.
