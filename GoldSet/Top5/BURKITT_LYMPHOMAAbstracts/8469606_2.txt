Burkitt's lymphoma of the jaw was first described as a jaw tumor occurring endemically in African children. We report a case of Burkitt's lymphoma in a child presenting with a painful jaw mass which proved to be Burkitt's lymphoma; renal involvement was also noted. The child was found to be HIV positive. Burkitt's may be the initial manifestation of HIV infection in the pediatric population.
