Ca 125 is a tumor marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of ovarian carcinoma. We investigated serum Ca 125 levels in 44 children with leukemia and 59 children with lymphoma at initial presentation and 4 weeks after chemotherapy. Serum Ca 125 levels were measured chemilumimetrically with a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The incidence of elevated serum Ca 125 levels was significantly higher in children with leukemia (14 children) and lymphoma (26 children) than in the healthy children (2 children). In the patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who had abdominal involvement and/or serous membrane involvement (ascides, pleural, pericardial effusion) at presentation, serum Ca 125 levels were significantly higher than in the patients without abdominal and/or serosal involvement. Serum Ca 125 levels were impressively increased in the patients with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) in whom abdominal and/or serous membrane involvement were observed more frequently than the other types of lymphoma. The increased serum Ca 125 levels in the patients returned to normal 4 weeks after chemotherapy when they achieved complete remission. In conclusion, serum Ca 125 seems to be a good indicator for serous membrane involvement and it seems to be a promising tumor marker in the assessment of therapeutic response in children with leukemia and NHL.
