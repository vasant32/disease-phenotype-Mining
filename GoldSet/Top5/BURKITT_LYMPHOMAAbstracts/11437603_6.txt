A new single-step purification method for Shiga toxin (Stx) was developed using receptor-mediated affinity chromatography, in which Gb3Cer (globotriaosylceramide) was conjugated to octyl Sepharose CL-4B as a carrier. This method achieves high yield and high purity in a small column on which Gb3Cer has been immobilized at high density. Using this affinity column, the Stx1 B subunit was purified with homogeneity by a one-step procedure from a crude extract of recombinant Stx1 B subunit-producing Escherichia coli. The purified Stx1 B subunit conserved a natural pentamer structure confirmed by gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium analysis. Furthermore, the purified Stx1 B subunit was able to bind specifically to Gb3Cer expressed on Burkitt's lymphoma cells. This versatile purification method can be used to isolate various types of natural as well as recombinant Stx, facilitating fundamental studies of human diseases caused by this toxin.
