The recently detected reciprocal translocations in chronic myeloic leucemia (CML) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) made it necessary to clarify if meningiomas really show the described monosomy 22 or also a translocation. In 10 out of 12 meningiomas a total or partial translocation of the missing chromosome 22 to another chromosome could be ruled out by fluorescence banding analysis. Two meningiomas showed marker chromosomes of such a complex composition that it was impossible to decide if a 22 translocation was present or not. From these results it was concluded that meningioma cells, in contrast to CML and BL, show almost regularly a loss of a definitive part of their genome.
