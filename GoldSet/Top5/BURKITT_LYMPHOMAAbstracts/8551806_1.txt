With regards to the geographical variation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) distribution, we present data from the immunophenotyping of 171 newly diagnosed cases of childhood ALL in Bulgaria during a 4 year period (1990-1994). On the basis of 17 phenotypic markers the distribution of immunological subtypes was as follows: AUL 4%; Pro-B ALL 13%; common ALL 42%; Pre-B ALL 11%; B-ALL 1%; T-ALL 28% and unclassified 2%. Most of the cases were between 2 and 5 years of age. Common ALL was predominant (53%) in this age group. The male:female ratio was 1.7:1. The frequency of T-ALL (28%) was significantly higher (P < 0.01; t = 3.49) in comparison to that reported for the U.S.A. and West European countries (mean 13%). It was close to the frequency reported by some authors for France (20%), Greece (26%) and south Italy (28.1%). These countries and Bulgaria might form an environmental area with a moderate frequency of T-ALL.
