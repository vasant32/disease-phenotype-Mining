We previously showed that the Epstein-Barr virus, which encodes the BARF1 gene, could transform rodent fibroblasts. In this work, the expression of the BARF1 gene was studied in the human Louckes B-lymphocyte cell line. Introduction of the BARF1 open reading frame under the control of the Mo-MuLV LTR promotor into nontumorigenic Louckes lymphoid cells led to the activation of the c-myc protooncogene and increased expression of the B-cell surface proteins, the transferrin receptor, CD21, and CD23. BARF1-expressing cells induced a diffuse lymphoma-like tumor in newborn rats treated with anti-thymocyte serum that was, however, transient and regressed after 3-4 weeks as the immune system recovered. The tumor induction was similar to that observed with lymphoid cell lines in vitro generated by infection with the B95-8 virus strain, in which lytic antigens are expressed at low levels. After long-term culture, Louckes cell clones lost expression of the BARF1 gene and were unable to induce tumors.
