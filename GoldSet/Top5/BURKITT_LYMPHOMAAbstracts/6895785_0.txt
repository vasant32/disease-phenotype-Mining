Twelve episodes of acute renal failure (ARF) in 11 children hospitalised for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) are reported. Six of 11 were classified as abdominal Burkitt type lymphoma, three as lymphoblastic convoluted cell lymphoma, and two as lymphoblastic lymphoma. Oliguria was present in six cases. Duration of ARF ranged from 3 to 23 days. Only one child required peritoneal dialysis. According to possible mechanisms of renal injury patients were divided into three groups: neoplastic renal infiltration (5 cases), uric acid intratubular precipitation (5 cases), treatment-related ARF (2 patients). ARF was always reversible, regardless of aetiology.
