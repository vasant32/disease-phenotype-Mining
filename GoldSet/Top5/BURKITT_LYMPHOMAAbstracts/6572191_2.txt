Cytosol proteins from normal lymphocytes, leukemic lymphocytes, and different cultured lymphoid cell lines were separated by two-dimensional mini gel electrophoresis. By staining with Coomassie blue, specific protein patterns were obtained. Very similar gel maps were produced by the cytosol proteins of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, hairy cells, and of in vitro grown B cells. Protein 36/6.2 (molecular weight/isoelectric point), consistently present in these cells, could not be demonstrated in normal lymphocytes. For the comparison of control Raji cells--an Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV)-DNA carrying Burkitt's lymphoma cell line--with Raji cells induced for early antigen (EA) production, 35S-methionine-labelled total cell lysates were analyzed. In the induced cells, an additional protein (100/5.5) was found; this might be one of the immunologically defined EBV-associated antigens. These results demonstrate that two-dimensional mini gel electrophoresis can be useful for the characterization of leukemic cells in addition to the morphological, cytochemical, and surface marker analyses.
