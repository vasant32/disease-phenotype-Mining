 PURPOSE: Paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10) is important for apoptosis resistance in cancer cells; however, the effect of PEG10 on tumor cell migration remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of PEG10 on proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion and migration in the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Raji. METHODS: Apoptosis was induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in pcDNA3.0/PEG10 transiently transfected HEK293T cells and PEG10-suppressed Raji cells. siRNAPEG10 was used to inhibit PEG10 expression. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) were performed to analyze the effect of PEG10 on apoptosis. CCK-8 were performed to detect cell proliferation and adhesion. Matrigel invasion were performed using PEG10-suppressed Raji cells to investigate cell migration. The expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases -2and -9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) were analyzed in PEG10-suppressed Raji cells using both real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: HEK293T cells that overexpressed PEG10 exhibited greater viability 48 h following treatment with 5-FU, relative to control cells. Specific inhibition of PEG10 expression by siRNA resulted in inhibition of growth and apoptosis in Raji cells. Adherence and invasion capabilities were downregulated and expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were reduced in PEG10-suppressed Raji cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that PEG10 enhances the apoptotic resistance and viability of Raji cells. The migration and adherence invasion capacity of Raji cells could potentially be affected by regulation of the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Our research provides a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy of lymphoma.
