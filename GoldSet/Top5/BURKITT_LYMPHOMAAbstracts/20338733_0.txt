Primary heart tumors are uncommon in children. The majority of them are benign, with only 10% malignant. Among malignant cardiac tumors, sarcoma (rhabdomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma, synovial sarcoma) and lymphoma (Burkitt's lymphoma, large B-cell lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma) predominate. There are few published pediatric series on malignant primary cardiac tumors. We report here 3 observations of primary malignant cardiac tumors, 2 cases of sarcoma (angiosarcoma and synovial sarcoma) and 1 case of Burkitt's lymphoma. A precise pathological diagnosis is necessary for the proper management of these patients. For sarcoma, treatment associates surgery and chemotherapy. Surgery should be as complete as possible because of the lack of chemotherapy sensitivity of some sarcomas, mainly angiosarcoma and synovial sarcoma. Therefore, the prognosis of cardiac sarcoma remains poor. For primary cardiac lymphoma, management should not be different from lymphoma in other locations. Chemotherapy is the main treatment, and surgery has to be used only when complications occur. Prognosis depends on histology and not lymphoma location, and so is better than the prognosis for sarcoma.
