In a sibship of four sisters, two had Burkitt's lymphoma localized to the breast. Their pretreatment Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology were not examined. No EBV genome was demonstrated in the tumors using an in situ hybridization technique. The mother showed an abnormal antibody response to EBV infection consisting of elevated IgA and IgG antibody titers to viral capsid antigen (VCA) and high IgG antibody titer to early antigen. Furthermore, one of the two healthy sisters showed elevated IgG antibody titer to VCA. The EBV serology is mimicking the findings in female carriers of the X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome.
