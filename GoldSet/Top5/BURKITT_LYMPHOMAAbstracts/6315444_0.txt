Cellular immune response to antigens associated with a type C retrovirus derived from Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) lymphoblastoid cells was studied in patients with hematopoietic malignancies, noncancer patients and healthy controls. Response was determined by lymphocyte blastogenesis assay measuring [3H]-thymidine incorporation, thereby enabling the calculation of stimulation indices (SI). Positive response (SI greater than 2.0) was demonstrated in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) and BL. No response was demonstrated in the non-cancer and healthy controls. Specific blastogenic response was obtained towards antigen extracted from three different cell lines infected with the tested type C retrovirus. No response was evident towards purified whole or purified disrupted virions or antigen extracted from murine myeloma MOPC-315 cells secreting a murine type C retrovirus or an antigen extracted from Mason-Pfizer monkey virus-infected NC-37 cells. The correlation between human hematopoietic malignancies and the in vitro lymphocyte blastogenic response to the BL-derived type C retrovirus was statistically highly significant.
