Invasive Aspergillus infection is still a major problem in immunocompromised patients. A central venous catheter infection by Aspergillus fumigatus, however, has not yet been reported. We describe the case of a 10-year-old female patient with B-type non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated according to the German chemotherapy protocol NHL-BFM 90. Isolation of Aspergillus fumigatus from the blood was the first hint of invasive aspergillosis. A central venous catheter-associated infection was suggested, since Aspergillus was also isolated from the thrombotic tip of the removed catheter. Secondary pulmonary aspergillosis was documented radiologically. The patient was treated successfully by Ampho-thericin B and Itraconazol and explantation of the central venous catheter under conditions of complete hematopoietic regeneration of the bone marrow with omission of the final chemotherapeutic cycle.
