Two cases of fatal interstitial pneumonitis developing after an autologous bone marrow transplantation are described. In both cases the autopsy revealed diffuse malignant pulmonary involvement. The first case involved a 4-year-old boy who had a Burkitt's lymphoma; the second case involved a 4-year-old girl with a neuroblastoma. The authors postulate that in these cases, the clinical picture may have been related to reinfusion of malignant cells.
