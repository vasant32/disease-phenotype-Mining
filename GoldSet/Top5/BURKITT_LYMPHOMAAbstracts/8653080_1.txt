Tumour necrosis Factor (TNF), Interleukin 1alpha and beta (IL-alpha and IL-beta), Interleukin 7 (IL-7) and Stem Cell Factor (SCF) are cytokines synthesized by immune system cells under stimulation of various agents. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a process that appears in response to specific stimuli, apparently following an intrinsic program. In this work we examined, in RA-1 human lymphoblastoid B cell line, the effect induced by different cytokines in cell proliferation and in programmed cell death. After 48 hours of treatment is present an antiproliferative affects, detected by 3H-thymidine incorporation and morphological changes related to apoptotic process.
