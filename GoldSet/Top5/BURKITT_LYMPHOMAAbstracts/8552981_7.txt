Human membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46) is a receptor for the measles virus and serves as a complement regulator which protects host cells from autologous complement attack. MCP is highly polymorphic due to a variety of mRNA splice products. The levels of MCP expression on T and myeloid cell lines are usually two-eightfold higher than those on their normal counterparts, whereas Burkitt's lymphoma B cell lines express less MCP than B cell lineages carrying no EB virus. The molecule has a Ser/Thr-rich (ST) domain adjacent to the functional domain, namely short consensus repeats (SCR). The ST domain and a cytoplasmic tail (CYT) contribute to the MCP polymorphism. The ST domain is encoded by three exons (A, B and C) and major ST isoforms are STABC, STBC and STC. The authors investigated the relationship between the expression levels and isoform usage of MCP by flow cytometry using specific antibodies against STA and STC, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with size markers for each splice variant, and by RT-PCR/Southern blotting using a specific probe for STA. The results were (1) the profiles of mean shifts of myeloid and T cell lines were STC < STA on flow cytometry while those of B cell lines and normal blood cells were STA < STC; (2) all cell lines tested by RT-PCR expressed the messages for the isoforms STBC/CYT1, STC/CYT1, STBC/CYT2, and STC/CYT2. The band for STABC/CYT2 overlapped that for STC/CYT1, and the band for STABC/CYT1 was marginal in all cell lines examined; (3) semi-quantitative analysis of the STABC isoforms by Southern blotting indicated the presence of high levels of the STABC messages in myeloid and T-cell lines in comparison with B lymphoid cells and normal leucocytes. Thus, the quantity of MCP expressed parallels the STABC message level, which is up-regulated in T and myeloid leukaemia cell lines.
