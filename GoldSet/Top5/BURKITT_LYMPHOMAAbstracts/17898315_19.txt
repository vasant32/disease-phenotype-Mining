GCET1 (germinal center B cell-expressed transcript-1) gene codes for a serpin expressed in germinal center (GC) B cells. Following the observation that follicular lymphoma cases exhibit an increased level of Gcet1 expression, compared with follicular hyperplasia, we have characterized Gcet1 protein expression in human tissues, cell lines, and a large series of lymphomas. To this end, we have performed immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses using a newly generated monoclonal antibody that is reactive in paraffin-embedded tissues. Our results demonstrate that Gcet1 is expressed exclusively by neoplasms hypothetically to be arrested at the GC stage of differentiation, including follicular lymphoma, nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, and a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, T-cell/histiocyte rich B-cell lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma. Within these tumors, Gcet-1 protein expression is restricted to a subset of GC B cells, establishing the existence of a distinct heterogeneity among normal and neoplastic GC B cells. None of the other B-cell lymphomas, that is, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma, was Gcet1(+), which underlines the potential utility of Gcet1 expression in lymphoma diagnosis. The results of RNA and protein expression should prompt further investigation into the role of Gcet1 in regulating B-cell survival.
