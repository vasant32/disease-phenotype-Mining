Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) appear to be at increased risk for development of neoplastic disease. We describe the case of a male teenager with SLE and Burkitt's lymphoma. His presentation was similar to that of an exacerbation of his underlying SLE. We believe this to be the first case of Burkitt's lymphoma in a patient with SLE. The association of SLE and malignancy, with emphasis on lymphoproliferative states, is discussed.
