OBJECTIVES: To determine the histologic types of testicular tumors and identify associated risk factors. METHODS: Data on clinical presentation, age, race, history of cryptorchidism or testicular trauma and histologic types, on each patient with testis tumor, were abstracted from medical records and the pathology register. RESULTS: Of 14 tumors, 11 were malignant. Five were Burkitt's and 2 non-Burkitt's lymphomas, 1 plasmocytoma and 3 seminomas. None of the seminomas occurred in black Africans. CONCLUSION: The epidemiology and histology of testis tumors in Yaounde differs considerably from other reported series. Burkitt's lymphoma is the commonest tumor. This alters the approach to the management of testicular masses. Race and geography seem to be important in the occurrence of testes tumors.
