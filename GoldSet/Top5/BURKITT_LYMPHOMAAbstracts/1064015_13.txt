Alkaline phosphatase [orthophosphoricmonoester phosphohydrolase (alkaline pH optimum), EC 3.1.3.1] purified from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line (Daudi) and Moloney-virus-induced murine leukemia (YAC) showed unique catalytic properties in substrate specificity and inhibition by cysteamine-S-phosphate. It migrated on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a single activity band. Alkaline phosphatase with similar properties was found in several human lymphoblastoid cell lines, in chronic lymphatic leukemic cells, in organs of leukemic mice, and in sera of patients with certain lymphoproliferative disorders.
