Concurrent BCL2 and MYC translocations, so called double hit (DH), are a rare finding in large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). Based on data from retrospective series, DH has been correlated with aggressive clinical behaviour and poor outcome. We conducted a consecutive study of DH incidence and correlation with pathologic and clinical characteristics, including response to Rituximab-containing chemotherapy and survival, in an unselected cohort of patients with LBCL. Translocations involving BCL2 and MYC loci were examined with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in 157 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma (BCLU). The incidence of DH was 11% in the total cohort, 7% of primary LBCL and 21% of transformed LBCL. DH lymphomas were all GCB immunophenotype and were more often BCLU. No clinical characteristics were correlated with the presence of DH, which also had no impact on overall response rate (ORR), relapse rate or overall survival (OS). However, sub-stratification of DH lymphomas by FISH indicated a possible inferior survival related to immunoglobulin MYC translocation partner gene. Screening of patients with BCLU and DLBCL of GCB type for DH BCL2/MYC translocation including MYC translocation partner gene may provide important prognostic information.
