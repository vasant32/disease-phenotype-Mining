Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) presenting through oral symptoms are rare. Between 1976 and 1987, a total of 17 cases (7 male, 10 female) were diagnosed in our departments. The first symptom was an intraoral tumour mass in 9 cases, loosening of teeth in 2 cases and paraesthesia in another 2. Most tumours (13/17) were located in the lower jaw. In only 5 cases had the referring physician or dentist suspected malignancy. In 3 cases, the histological diagnosis was Burkitt's lymphoma. The grade of malignancy was classified as low in 4 cases, intermediate in 3 and high in 8. None of the patients was HIV-positive. Nine patients died of their disease within 1-132 months (mean 18.3 months).
