Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with many lymphoproliferative diseases, such as infectious mononucleosis and Burkitt's lymphoma. Consequently, EBV is one of the most extensively studied herpesviruses. Surprisingly, a putative G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) gene of EBV, BILF1, has hitherto escaped attention, yet BILF1-like genes are conserved among all known lymphocryptovirus species, suggesting that they play a pivotal role in viral infection. To determine the function of EBV BILF1, the activity of this gene and its products was studied. BILF1-specific mRNA was detected in various EBV-positive cell types and found to be expressed predominantly during the immediate early and early phases of infection in vitro. Interestingly, in COS-7 cells transfected with BILF1 expression constructs, a decrease in forskolin-induced CRE-mediated transcription was measured, as well as an increase in NF-kappaB-mediated transcription. In contrast, CRE-mediated transcription was increased in EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma cells as well as EBV-positive lymphoblastoid B cells transfected with BILF1, whereas NF-kappaB-mediated transcription levels remained unaffected in these cells. All observed activities were sensitive to treatment with pertussis toxin, indicating that the BILF1-encoded protein mediates these activities by coupling to G proteins of the G(i/o) class. Finally, reduced levels of phosphorylated RNA-dependent antiviral protein kinase were observed in COS-7 and Burkitt's lymphoma cells transfected with BILF1. Neither of the observed effects required a ligand to interact with the BILF1 gene product, suggesting that BILF1 encodes a constitutively active GPCR capable of modulating various intracellular signaling pathways.
