A number of agents including the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) can induce an abortive virus cycle in the EBV nonproducer Burkitt's lymphoma line Raji. We describe the pattern of viral RNAs transcribed in uninduced cells and in cells treated with TPA for 8 hr, as analyzed by Northern blotting. By comparing the patterns of RNAs observed in cells treated with TPA, TPA plus cycloheximide, or cycloheximide alone, we have tested whether any EBV gene in TPA-treated Raji cells would be inducible directly by TPA in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, similarly to immediate-early genes induced by superinfection of Raji cells with P3HR-1 virus in the presence of cycloheximide. We demonstrate here that induction of all early EBV genes is dependent on ongoing protein synthesis. The experiments do not provide an answer to whether TPA acts by activating an initial step in the cascade of virus production or whether TPA has a simultaneous pleiotropic effect on the regulation of a large number of viral genes.
