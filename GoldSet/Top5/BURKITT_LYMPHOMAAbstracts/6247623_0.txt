By the indirect immunofluorescence technique, IgM antibodies to the cell surface of an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) producer cell line, P3HR-1, were detected in sera from infectious mononucleosis (IM) patients but not in sera from patients with Burkitt lymphoma or nasopharyngeal carcinoma nor in sera from healthy adult donors having antibodies to EBV-specific viral capsid antigen (VCA). Titers of the IgM antibodies were higher in the earlier stages of IM, a pattern similar to that for IgM antibodies to VCA. The IgM antibodies to the cell surface were identified as being those against the EBV-specific membrane antigen (MA) by the following criteria: (1) The antibodies were reactive to MA-positive cell preparations but to MA-negative cell preparations. (2) Titers of the IgM antibodies were not significantly affected after absorption of sera with sheep red blood cells which could completely eliminate heterophil antibodies in the same sera. Detection of the IgM antibodies to MA may have a particular diagnostic value for providing evidence of a recent EBV infection.
