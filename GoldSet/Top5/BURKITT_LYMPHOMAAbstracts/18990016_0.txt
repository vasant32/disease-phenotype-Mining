Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the 11th most common cancer in terms of incidence. It is most frequent in high income countries, with rates more than twice those of middle--to low-income countries. It is usually fatal, with a 5 year survival rate of less than 35 percent. It is not a single cancer, but rather a wide group of cancers (including entities such as Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), each with a district geographical distribution, development path, age profile and prognosis. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is increasing in incidence world wide. On this background, in this paper an attempt has been made to study the trends in Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in various Indian populations in both sexes.
