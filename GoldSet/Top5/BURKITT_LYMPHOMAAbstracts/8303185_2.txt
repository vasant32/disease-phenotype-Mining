In children, lymphomas are highly malignant and belong to the Burkitt type (B-cells) or to the non-Burkitt lymphoblastic type (T-cells). Most of the lesions are abdominal (gastrointestinal tract, mesentery) and/or mediastinal. The disease is often diagnosed on the cytology of an effusion or on a bone marrow differential cell count, and if these are negative, on a biopsy of the tumoral mass. The patients must be taken care of immediately, in conditions of emergency and in a way appropriate to the situation (renal function, prevention or treatment of lysis syndrome). Treatment consists of chemotherapy adjusted to the histo-immunological type. It currently cures 80% of the children.
