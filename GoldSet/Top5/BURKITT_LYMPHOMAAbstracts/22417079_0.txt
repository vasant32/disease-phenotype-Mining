Constipation is a common problem in children and adolescents, accounting for over 25% of all visits to pediatric gastroenterologists. Approximately 95% of childhood constipation is functional in nature. Primary gastrointestinal malignancies are rare in childhood and adolescence. When present in the gastrointestinal tract, Burkitt's lymphoma is typically located in the ileocecal region. We present a case of primary Burkitt's lymphoma of the transverse colon in an adolescent presenting with acute exacerbation of constipation, abdominal pain, and later, rectal bleeding and progressive weight loss.
