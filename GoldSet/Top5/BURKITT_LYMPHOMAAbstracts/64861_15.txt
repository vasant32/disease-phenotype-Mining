Burkitt's lymphoma (B.L.) is very restricted geographically, whereas the Epstein-Barr virus (E.B.V.), a very likely causal factor, exists all over the world. It is proposed that perinatal infection (either transplacental, or, more probably, neonatal) is an important risk factor for the development of B.L. This hypothesis arose when the epidemiological characteristics of E.B.V. infection were compared in different parts of the world and is supported by the preliminary results of a seroepidemiological prospective study of B.L. E.B.V. would behave in a manner similar to that of animal tumour viruses whose oncogenic potential is greatly enhanced by neonatal infection.
