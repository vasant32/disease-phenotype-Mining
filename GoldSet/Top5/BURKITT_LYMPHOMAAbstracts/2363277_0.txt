The properties of lymphoid Namalwa cell line propagated at the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences Research Institute of Viral Preparations for interferon production are described. The scanning and transmissive electron microscopy studies of the cells showed their morphological stability and the absence of microbial contamination. The 46-48-chromosome cells comprised 85% of the population, hypodiploid cells (44-45 chromosomes), 9%, tetraploid and hypertetraploid cells, 3%. Spontaneous aberrations were detected in 3% of the chromosome. Inoculation of the cells into unsuppressed laboratory animals (rabbits, guinea pigs, adult or suckling mice) or chick embryos did not cause the development of any pathological process. Namalwa cells were shown to produce interferon after multiple (up to 4 times) induction with Newcastle disease virus.
