Leukemia patients in remission were immunized with RAJI lymphoid tissue culture cell lines. Four of 7 patients developed antibody to the immunizing cell as well as to allogeneic leukemia cells. Sera from 3 patients were tested against autochthonous tumor cells either frozen or obtained at the time of disease relapse. Patient's sera were cytotoxic to their own leukemia cells; however, this cytotoxicity was lost at the time of relapse.
