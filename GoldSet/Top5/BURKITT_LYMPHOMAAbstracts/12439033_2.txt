Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder is a clinical challenge. Traditional chemotherapy results in tumor response, but toxicity and transplant rejection limit survival. The authors treated seven patients with malignant lymphoma after organ transplant with chemotherapy tailored to individual patient response. Chemotherapy consisted of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone, with or without doxorubicin (Adriamycin; Pharmacia & Upjohn, Peapack, NJ, U.S.A.), or the ProMACE-CytaBOM regimen. Six of seven patients (86%) showed a complete response to treatment, with five of seven (71%) alive disease-free at 9 to 72 months (mean 38.2) after treatment. The results show that chemotherapy tailored to individual patient response is a safe and effective therapy for malignant lymphoma arising in patients with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
