Rabbits were immunized with two kinds of human B-cell lines (SOMMER-B, and RPMI number 1788 cells) to get anti-B-cell sera. Sera were absorbed with human red blood cells, human liver, human brain and human T cells (MOLT-4 and SOMMER-T cells). Cytotoxicity of absorbed sera was not only tested against B cells which were used for immunization but also tested against unrelated B cells, including B35M cells derived from Burkitt lymphoma specimens. Results indicated that established human B cells had antigenic determinants which were shared with allogeneic human B cells, but not shared with non-lymphoid cells or tissues, nor with extablished human T cells.
