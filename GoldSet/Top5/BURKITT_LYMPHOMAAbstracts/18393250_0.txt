 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in Burkitt leukemia (BL). METHODS: Conventional cytogenetics (CC) was carried out to detect the karyotypes. Meanwhile, three color interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to detect the t(8;14)(q24;q32) in 17 newly diagnosed BL. RESULTS: The results showed that the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities was 41.2% (7/17) by CC technique, including one of each for simple t(8;14)(q24;q32), complex chromosomal abnormality containing t(8;14)(q24;q32), t(8;22)(q24;q11), the complex chromosomal abnormality of t(12;22)(?;?), t(2;13)(?;?) with + 12, and one with two marker chromosomes. FISH method detected eight cases of t(8;14)(q24;q32), including the two detected by CC technique. Five samples (5/8) showed 2A1G1O2F (two blue, one green, one orange and two yellow signals in interphase nuclei), while three samples (3/8) showed 2A1G1O1F(two blue, one green, one orange and one yellow signals in interphase nuclei). CONCLUSION: Two different breakpoints have been identified on the c-Myc locus on 8q24. Interphase FISH was more sensitive in detecting t(8;14)(q24;q32), and it is an important complement to CC. It should be used as a routine method for diagnosis of BL.
