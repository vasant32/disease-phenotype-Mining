An NK cell activity-resistant human lymphoid T cell line (CEM-NKr) expressing the transfected Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gp350 gene was used in membrane immunofluorescence (MIF) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays to analyze the gp350-specific humoral and ADCC responses in groups of EBV-seropositive persons. Results show that there is no correlation between gp350-specific ADCC-mediating antibody titers and MIF or EBV neutralizing antibody titers. For example, sera from patients in the acute phase of infectious mononucleosis, while positive by MIF assay or EBV neutralization test, were not reactive in the ADCC assay. Results also show that nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients on MIF present high IgG titers against gp350 compared with healthy persons. Anti-gp350 IgA antibodies were detected in all groups tested; however, titers were highest in the NPC group.
