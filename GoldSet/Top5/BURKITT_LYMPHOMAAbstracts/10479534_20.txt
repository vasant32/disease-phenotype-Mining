B cell hyperactivation accompanies HIV infection and is believed to contribute to the increased incidence of B cell lymphoma in persons with AIDS. To examine B cell activation which precedes the development of AIDS-associated lymphoma, we measured levels of two B cell stimulatory molecules, soluble CD23 (sCD23) and interleukin 6 (IL6), in the serum of HIV-infected individuals prior to the diagnosis of lymphoma. Serum sCD23 was elevated in those subjects who developed lymphoma, compared to AIDS, HIV+, and HIV- controls (P = 0.001). Serum IL6 was significantly elevated in subjects who developed Burkitt's/small noncleaved cell lymphoma (BL/SNC, P = 0.01), but not in those subjects who developed large cell, immunoblastic, or central nervous system lymphomas, compared to CD4-matched AIDS controls who did not have lymphoma. These results suggest that lymphomagenesis of the BL/SNC subtype of AIDS lymphoma reflects B cell hyperactivation of a different nature from that which precedes other subtypes of AIDS-associated B cell lymphoma.
