From previous studies, lymphocyte DNA from human leukemias and DNA from involved tissues of patients with Hodgkin's disease or Burkitt's lymphoma contain sequences that are absent from their normal counterparts. These sequences are related to those found in particulate elements associated with these neoplasias and possessing biochemical properties characteristic of RNA tumor viruses. Similar observations have been made of unique sequences related to those of the feline virus RD-114 and found in spontaneous mastocytomas in cats. Here we extend these results to the classical murine model of virus-induced leukemias. Splenic DNA from BALB/c mice with leukemia induced by Rauscher leukemia virus (RLV) possess some RLV-related sequences that do not exist in normal BALB/c DNA. Furthermore, these leukemia-specific sequences were absent in all other mouse strains examined, including AKR, a strain with a high incidence of spontaneous leukemia. The DNA of all noninfected mouse strains possesses considerable homology with the RLV genome. Temperature denaturation studies indicate, however, that although the RLV-related sequences found in all normal mice are similar to each other, they are not exactly homologous with RLV sequences. We conclude that RLV-induced leukemia in BALB/c results in the insertion of RLV sequences into cellular DNA that itself possesses only partial homology with the RLV genome.
