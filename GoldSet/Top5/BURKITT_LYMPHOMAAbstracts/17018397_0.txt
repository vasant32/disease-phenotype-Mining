We report a population-based investigation on adult acute precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia, Burkitt's lymphoma and T lymphoblastic lymphoma in a defined geographic area. The age-adjusted incidence rates for the three diagnostic groups were 0.47, 0.16 and 0.2 per 100,000 per year, respectively. Clinical characteristics and outcome following treatment are reported.
