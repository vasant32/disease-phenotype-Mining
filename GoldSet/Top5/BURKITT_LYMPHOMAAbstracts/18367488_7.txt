We studied a group of 54 children with Burkitt's lymphoma from Southeastern Brazil, where epidemiological status of Burkitt's lymphoma is poorly understood. Epstein-Barr virus association showed an intermediate frequency (~60%) between endemic and sporadic subtypes. Median age was five years. Epstein-Barr virus infection was significantly associated to low age (Epstein-Barr virus(+) four years vs. Epstein-Barr virus(-) eight years). Sex ratio (M:F) was 2:1, with a significantly higher number of males in old age classes. Young age at diagnosis and excess of males at older ages, as well as a causal relationship between low age, epstein-barr virus and Burkitt's lymphoma risk, may characterize Burkitt's lymphoma in Brazil.
