During the period from 1978 to 1981, 52 patients with ALL were diagnosed and treated at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center. Using standard cell markers to subtype the blasts, 49 of the patients could be classified: 16 were found to be T-cell ALL, 10 common ALL, five null ALL, four pre-B and 14 were partially characterized as non-B, non-T. Analysis of the series revealed two distinctive features: high prevalence (30%) of T-cell ALL among both Jews and Arabs and a high proportion, two-thirds, of high risk patients due to high initial WBC counts, unfavourable age or T-cell characteristics. The minimal incidence of ALL among the Gaza Strip Arab children during the study period is 4:100,000, which is close to the incidence in the Western world. During previous years the leukemia incidence in the Gaza Strip was very low while the most common lymphatic malignancies were Burkitt tumor and other non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
