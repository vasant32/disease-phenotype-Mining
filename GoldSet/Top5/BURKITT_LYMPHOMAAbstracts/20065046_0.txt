We report on 2 children with Burkitt's lymphoma accompanied by extensive extranodal involvement treated with chemotherapy and Rituximab in combination with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (Auto-PBSCT) regimens. No obvious side effects could be seen during the Rituximab therapy. Both children achieved complete remission with no relapse after being followed up for 4.3 and 4 years, respectively. Our limited experience show that Rituximab in combination with chemotherapy and Auto-PBSCT might have better therapeutic effects on Burkitt's lymphoma of children and the side effects of Rituximab therapy is minimal and can be well tolerated.
