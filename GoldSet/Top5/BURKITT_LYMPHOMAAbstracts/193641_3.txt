Attempts were made to superinfect two epithelial-Burkitt hybrid cell lines, designated D98/HR-1 and D98/Raji, with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and to investigate the expression of some cell surfacr markers including histocompatibility antigens, and the presence of B-cell markers, such as receptors for the third complement component and for monkey red blood cells. Successful superinfection of D98/HR-1 cells with EBV was made evident by the expression of early antigen and, to a lesser extent, virus capsid antigen. Only a rare D98/Raji cell was found to be positive for early antigen. The histocompatibility antigens of the parental cell lines D98, HR-1, and Raji were expressed on the surfaces of the hybrid cells. Receptors for third complement components b and d were not detected on the hybrid cells or on the D98P OR HR-1 cell lines; they were found, however, on the Raji cells, indicating that EBV receptors and complement receptors can be separated. The significance of the infection of the hybrid cells with EBV and the expression of cell surface markers is described.
