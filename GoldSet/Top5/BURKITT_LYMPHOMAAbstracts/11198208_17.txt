We describe a young woman with Burkitt's lymphoma, treated with intravenous adriamycine and cyclophosphamide and intrathecal cytarabine. She developed a reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) with typical MRI findings. Diffusion-weighted images during the first days after the onset of symptoms predicted a small irreversible lesion in the frontal lobe, verified on T2-weighted images 1 month later. The patient showed full recovery after high-dose steroid treatment.
