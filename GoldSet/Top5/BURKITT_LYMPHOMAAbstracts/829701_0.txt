Sixty-six cases of mass lesions compressing the spinal cord are presented. The masses were neoplastic in 86.36% of the cases. Epidural masses (80.30%) remain by far the largest group, consisting chiefly of Burkitt's lymphoma and various metastatic carcinomas. Only 6.06% of the lesions were intramedullary and the glioma/paraglioma remains virtually absent.
