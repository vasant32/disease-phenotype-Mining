Soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R) was found to be spontaneously released from human myeloma cell line U266 cells into culture supernatant, and was quantitatively measured with a fluorescence sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay employing antibodies specific to IL-6R. The supernatant IL-6R was generated only from IL-6R-positive cell lines; myeloma cell lines RPMI8226 and PRMI1788, and myelomonocytic cell lines U937, THP-1, and HL-60. In contrast, it was not released from the IL-6R-negative cells; T cell line Molt-4 and Burkitt lymphoma cell line Raji. SDS-PAGE analysis of the soluble IL-6R from U266 cells suggested a molecular weight of approximately 50-55 kDa, 25-30 kDa smaller than the mature cell surface receptor. These results suggest that the generation of soluble IL-6R may be a maker of myeloma cells and myelomonocytic cells.
