Eight monoclonal antibodies (MAb) of IgG2a isotype that were produced against human melanomas were tested for tumor growth-inhibiting properties in nude mice injected with human melanoma cells of various origins. Four of the eight MAb inhibited growth of these tumors, and all four of these antibodies reacted in antibody-dependent macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity (ADMC) assays in vitro. The MAb that were inactive in vivo also did not react in these assays in vitro. The number of antibody-binding sites per cell on the tumor cell surface was significantly higher for tumoricidal MAb as compared to unreactive MAb. On the other hand, the percentage of tumor cells binding the MAb and the binding affinity to these cells were the same for the two groups of MAb. Also, tumoricidal and nontumoricidal MAb bound with similar affinity and antibody density to Fc receptors on macrophages. The importance of the number of antibody sites on the tumor cell surface for tumor destruction by MAb was confirmed by the demonstration of tumoricidal effects of mixtures of MAb that were by themselves not tumoricidal. MAb binding to different molecules on melanoma cells were complementary in ADMC, whereas MAb directed to the same molecule but to different epitopes were not.
