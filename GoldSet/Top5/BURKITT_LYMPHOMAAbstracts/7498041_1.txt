A histological analysis of 3141 cases of oral tumours and tumour-like lesions diagnosed at Kenyatta National Hospital between 1978 and 1992 has been carried out. Squamous cell carcinoma, salivary gland tumours and lymphoid tumours form the majority of lesions. In general, the histological distribution of the oral tumours do not differ significantly from those reported in non African series save for the Burkitt's lymphoma.
