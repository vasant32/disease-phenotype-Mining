Burkitt lymphoma presenting as a peritoneal and small thickening problem mimicking carcinomatosis is very rare. We present a previously healthy 7-year-old boy with a 1-week history of worsening abdominal distention, vomiting and melena. He demonstrated liver nodules, but no pathologic chest or abdominal adenopathy was present. It was finally determined that he was suffering from Burkitt lymphoma. We present this case because it is such a rare but very significant manifestation of Burkitt lymphoma.
