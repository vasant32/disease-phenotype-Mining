Various biopsies from different European malignant lymphomas, two biopsies from nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and material from non-neoplastic lymph nodes were assayed for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA by nucleic acid hybridization. Reassociation kinetics of in vitro-labelled EBV DNA were studied in the presence of tumor DNA. The lymphomas tested included among others follicular lymphomas, germinocytomas, immunoblastic lymphomas and lymphoplasmacytoid immunocytomas. Epstein-Barr viral DNA was demonstrated within the two nasopharyngeal carcinoma biopsies as expected. A histologically typical Burkitt lymphoma as well as an immunoblastic lymphadenopathy with excessive plasmacytosis also contained EBV-DNA. The Burkitt biopsy revealed about 15 EBV genome equivalents per cell. Antibodies against EBV-specific antigens were highly elevated in the serum of this patient. The material of the patient with immunoblastic lymphadenopathy contained 2-3 EBV genome equivalents per cell.
