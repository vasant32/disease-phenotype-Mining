Several cerebrospinal fluid markers were found to be elevated in Burkitt's lymphoma patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Antibody levels to the virus capsid antigen of the Epstein-Barr virus and to the brain cell antigens myelin and cerebroside were elevated during active CNS disease. Immune complexes were present in levels above 100 micrograms/ml in most patients with CNS involvement but tended to be low or negative in patients without CNS disease. Oligoclonal IgG bands were present in 12 of 13 patients with CNS disease and in only 3 of 26 patients with no clinical evidence of disease. None of these markers were present in 6 other tumor patients without CNS disease. The presence of these markers in 12 of 13 patients in whom CNS disease was involved suggests that these markers may be useful in determining the status of the tumor with regard to involvement of the CNS.
