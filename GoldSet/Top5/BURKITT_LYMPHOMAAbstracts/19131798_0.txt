Primary gastric lymphoma is a rare event in childhood. We describe a 13-year-old boy with gastric Burkitt-like lymphoma localized in the fundus. Symptoms mimicking gastritis-epigastric pain, hypochromic anemia, anorexia, and weight loss had been present for a few months before diagnosis. No Helicobacter pylori infection was shown at diagnosis. Biopsies obtained by ultrasound gastroscopy proved the diagnosis; F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography detected an isolated large gastric hypermetabolic mass. According to the international FAB/LMB 96 trial, the patient was treated with chemotherapy alone and is in first complete remission 2(1/2) years after diagnosis.
