A human homologue of the murine zinc finger protein zfr is transcriptionally induced in the Epstein-Barr virus-positive Burkitt lymphoma cell line Raji upon treatment with the granulocyte/macrophage lineage ganglioside IV(3)NeuAc-nLcOse(4)Cer. The gene was cloned by a rapid amplification of cDNA ends approach based on a cDNA clone. The resulting hzfr sequence is 3393 base pairs in length coding for a protein of 1057 amino acids. Sequence alignments between hzfr and zfr reveal an identity of 92% on the nucleotide level and an identity of 96.4% on the amino acid level, respectively. Based on Southern blot data hzfr can be addressed as a single copy gene. Tissue-specific expression was determined by semi-quantitative PCR of normalized cDNA populations from various human tissues with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal control. Highest levels of transcripts were found in brain. hzfr transcripts could not be detected in skeletal muscle.
