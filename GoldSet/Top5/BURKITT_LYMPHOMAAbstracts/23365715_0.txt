Burkitt lymphoma is a highly aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma that responds favorably if diagnosed accurately and treated early. Recognition of the various radiologic manifestations of Burkitt lymphoma can help guide the clinician to expedite appropriate chemotherapy. We present two cases that illustrate different radiologic presentations of this aggressive gastrointestinal malignancy in children. Case 1 features a 7-year-old boy who presented to our hospital with recurrent ileocecal intussusception. Case 2 describes a 16-year-old male with history of blood-streaked stools. Ileocectomy was performed in both cases and histologic analysis showed the "starry sky pattern" and t(8;14) translocation, classic for Burkitt lymphoma. Both patients remain disease-free following surgical excision and chemotherapy.
