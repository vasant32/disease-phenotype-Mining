Raji-HN2 is a B cell lymphoma (Burkitt lymphoma) line that was made resistant to nitrogen mustard. The drug-resistant phenotype was accompanied by changes in gene expression. The expression of four unrelated genes was examined by Northern blot analysis. Raji-HN2 cells were found to contain about twice the number of actin mRNA found in Raji cells. Both cell lines were found to contain equivalent amounts of beta 2-microglobulin, c-myc oncogene, and immunoglobulin C mu mRNAs. The C mu mRNA was, however, larger in size in Raji-HN2 cells. Alterations in actin and C mu mRNAs in Raji-HN2 cells were not due to gene amplification or rearrangement because Southern blot analysis revealed no changes in the genomic organization of these genes. The increased actin mRNA content was correlated with an increased actin content of Raji-HN2 cells. The F-actin (stained with 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazolylphallacidin) content of single cells was quantitated in a meridian interactive laser cytometer. Raji-HN2 cells contained about twice the amount of F-actin present in the parental Raji cells. Similar results were obtained when large populations, 10(6) cells each, were examined in a flow cytometer.
