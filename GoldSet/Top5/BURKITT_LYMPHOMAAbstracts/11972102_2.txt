Large gastric folds in adults are seen in many benign and malignant conditions, but they are rare in children with malignant diseases such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The authors report a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who had large gastric folds and jaundice as the initial symptoms. A 14-year-old boy was referred to the authors' hospital with upper abdominal pain and jaundice. A standard barium upper gastrointestinal series showed large gastric folds in the entire stomach. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a typical diffuse infiltrating type of pancreatic lymphoma. Because complete bilateral lower limb paralysis developed as a result of the epidural soft tissue mass, laminectomy and tumor resection were performed and a diagnosis of disseminated Burkitt lymphoma was established. After completing 6 months of chemotherapy, the patient has been disease-free without neurologic complications for 2.5 years.
