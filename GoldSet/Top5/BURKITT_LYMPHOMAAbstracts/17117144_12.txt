 OBJECTIVES: To assess complete remission (CR) and survival in patients with systemic AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma (ARL) receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). METHODS: We analyzed the Grupo de Estudio del SIDA register of systemic ARL, which started in Jan 1994, to collect cases diagnosed at 15 institutions prospectively and with active follow-up every 6 months. The date of censorship for this study was March 2005. RESULTS: During the study period, 210 consecutive patients were diagnosed with ARL, with a median age 39 of years, 75.7% of whom were male, and with a median baseline CD4 count of 160 cells/microL. Histologic subtypes were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCL; n = 153 [72.9%]), Burkitt and atypical Burkitt/Burkitt-like lymphoma (BL; n = 40 [19.0%]), T-cell lymphoma (TC; n = 8 [3.8%]), and miscellaneous (n = 9 [4.3%]). Chemotherapy with or without other modalities was administered to 186 (88.6%) patients. In an intent-to-treat analysis of 184 patients who received at least 1 chemotherapy course with adequate follow-up to assess their response, 119 (64.7%) achieved CR, and the median length of survival (Kaplan-Meier analysis) was 52 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23 to 82 months). Factors independently associated with CR were histologic subtype and International Prognostic Index (IPI) score. Factors independently associated with improved overall length of survival (OS) were CR, low IPI score, and histologic subtype. The single factor independently associated with disease-free survival was Ann Arbor stage. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ARL treated with HAART, CR was associated exclusively with tumor-related factors. The CR rate was poorer in patients with BL and TC subtypes and was inversely correlated with IPI score. OS was independently associated with CR, IPI score, and the histologic subtype.
