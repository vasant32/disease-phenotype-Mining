The aims of this study were to investigate the role of cytokines (tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interferon gamma (IFN gamma) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) in augmenting graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL). We have investigated the effector cells involved in GVL, by studying the role of these cells in purging of the cell line K562 in short-term bone marrow cultures. The effect of the addition in vitro of rGCSF was also studied. Monitoring of purging was achieved by cytotoxicity assays, DNA analysis and the use of the polymerase chain reaction for the detection of bcr/abl transcripts in the Philadelphia positive (Ph+) K562 cell line. Supernatants from IL-2-treated and non-treated bone marrow were tested for cytokine production (TNF alpha and IFN gamma). The results have shown that the main cytotoxic effector cells in the bone marrow generated by IL-2 have the CD56+ CD8+ phenotype. Overnight incubation of bone marrow was sufficient to generate cytotoxic cells as measured by Chromium51 (Cr51) release assays. Measurable levels of TNF alpha but not IFN gamma were also detected in supernatants. Addition of TNF alpha and IFN gamma to the IL-2 in the bone marrow cultures augmented the cytotoxicity but tended to inhibit progenitor cell growth as measured by granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (GM-CFU) and erythroid blast-forming unit (BFU-e) assays. An estimate of the purging of the marrow could also be achieved by DNA analysis of K562 DNA in bone marrow. The bcr/abl transcript could still be detected by PCR analysis in marrow containing 1% K562 and treated with IL-2 for 24 h, but by 6 days of incubation the bcr/abl transcript was weak or undectable. The results suggest that although reduction in the proportion of leukaemia in contaminated marrow can be detected after incubation with IL-2 for 24 h, complete elimination of minimal residual disease requires longer incubation times.
