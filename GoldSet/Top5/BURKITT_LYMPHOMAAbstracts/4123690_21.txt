Burkitt's lymphomas, linked by previous studies with the DNA-containing Epstein-Barr virus, contain an RNA related in sequence to that of Rauscher leukemia virus. The present study establishes that the viral-related RNA found in Burkitt's tumors is a 70S component encapsulated with RNA-instructed DNA polymerase in a particle possessing a density characteristic of RNA tumor viruses. Further, the DNA synthesized by the Burkitt particles hybridizes specifically to the RNA of Rauscher leukemia virus. Thus, four features characteristic of a known oncogenic RNA agent are also exhibited by particles found with a high (87%) frequency in Burkitt's tumors. The relation between the RNA particle and the Epstein-Barr virus and their etiological roles remains to be elucidated. However, relevant to these issues is the finding reported here that the presence of Epstein-Barr virus information in nonneoplastic cells does not lead to the production of the RNA particles that have been detected now in three different human neoplasias, including leukemias, breast cancer, and Burkitt's disease.
