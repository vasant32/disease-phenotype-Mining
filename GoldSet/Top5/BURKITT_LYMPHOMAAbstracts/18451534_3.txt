Silurus asotus lectin (SAL) is a member of the rhamnose-binding lectin (RBL) family, and recognizes globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) on the cell surface of Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, such as Raji and Daudi cells. The variation of gene expression in the treatment of both cells with SAL was analyzed using the differential display (DD) method with combination of 16 kinds of arbitary primers and 3 kinds of anchor primers. Treatment of Raji cells with SAL down-regulated mitochondria-associated granulocyte-macropharge colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling molecule (Magmas) gene, and up-regulated N-myc downstream regulated gene (NDRG) 3. On the other hand, treatment of Daudi cells with SAL down-regulated Rad50 gene. Since Magmas gene expression was repressed in SAL-treated Raji cells, but did not change in SAL-treated D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morphorino-1-propanol (PDMP)-pretreated Raji cells, it was clear that the expression of Magmas, NDRG3 or Rad50 was regulated by SAL binding to Gb3.
