A case of a 10-year-old boy with American Burkitt lymphoma is presented in whom a 14q+ due to t(8;14)(q23;q32) was shown to exist in the ascitic lymphoma cells. This appears to be the first demonstration of such a translocation in uncultured material. In addition, another translocation involving the X chromosome, hitherto not observed in Burkitt tumors, was demonstrated. The karyotypic findings have been related to the cytogenetic experience in Burkitt and other lymphomas, with emphasis being put on the importance of the 14q+ anomaly in lymphoproliferative diseases.
