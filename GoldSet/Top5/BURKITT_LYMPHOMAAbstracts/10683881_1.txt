High-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation has gained widespread acceptance for the treatment of certain malignancies. Since the introduction of this therapy in 1988 we have treated 272 patients. Indications for high-dose chemotherapy were high-risk large cell lymphoma and lymphoblastic or Burkitt lymphoma in first remission (73 patients), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in chemosensitive relapse (65 patients), Hodgkin's lymphoma in relapse (52 patients), germ cell tumours with inadequate response to chemotherapy (34 patients), multiple myeloma (29 patients), and other malignancies (19 patients). Treatment mortality was 1.8%. The 3-year event-free survival and overall survival for all patients were 48 and 61% respectively. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation has become a safe procedure and is considered the treatment of choice for relapsed large cell lymphoma, relapsed Hodgkin's disease, stage II or III multiple myeloma, and germ cell tumours with inadequate response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In other situations, including aggressive lymphoma with risk factors, acute leucaemia or breast cancer, the superiority of high-dose over conventional chemotherapy remains to be proven. Patients with such diseases should not receive high-dose chemotherapy outside a controlled clinical study.
