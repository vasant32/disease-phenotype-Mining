A 77-year-old man was admitted because of massive pericardial effusion and cardiac tumor. Cytological examination of the effusion and histological examination of a subcutaneous tumor in the chest wall revealed diffuse large B cell lymphoma. The immunophenotype of tumor cells was CD5+ CD20+ CD22+ CD38+ HLA-DR+ CD19-. Chromosome analysis revealed complex abnormal karyotypes containing t(8;14) (q24;q32). C-myc gene rearrangement was shown by Southern blotting. Chemotherapy with pirarubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristin, and prednisolone (THP-COP) was not effective for his lymphoma. He suffered from cardiac tamponade and died at 5 months after diagnosis. Autopsy revealed a large cardiac tumor, extensive epicardial infiltration, tiny tumors in the lung and pancreas, but no lymphadenopathy, the combination of which suggested a primary cardiac lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry for p53 protein showed nuclear staining of more than 50% of the lymphoma cells. In situ hybridization for EBER-1 was negative. Rearrangement of c-myc gene and overexpression of p53 protein are usually observed in Burkitt's lymphoma and some cases of high grade lymphomas including AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In this case the association of these molecular findings and resistance to chemotherapy is suggested.
