The lethal response of cultured cancer cells lines K-562, U-937, DG-75, and HL-60 were measured directly after a 4 h exposure to a pulsating electromagnetic field (PEMF, sinusoidal wave form, 35 mT peak, 50 Hz) [Traitcheva et al. (2003): Bioelectromagnetics 24:148-158] and 24 h later, to determine the post-exposure effect. The results were found to depend on the medium, pH value, conductivity, and temperature. From these experiments, suitable conditions were chosen to compare the vitality between K-562 cells and normal human lymphocytes after PEMF treatment and photodynamic action. Both agents enhance necrosis synergistically for diseased as well as for healthy cells, but the lymphocytes are more resistant. The efficacy of PEMF on the destruction of cancer cells is further increased by heating (hyperthermia) of the suspension up to 44 degrees C or by lowering the pH-value (hyperacidity) to pH 6.4. Similar apoptosis and necrosis can be obtained using moderate magnetic fields (B < or = 15 mT 50/60 Hz), but this requires longer treatment of at least over a week. PEMF application combined with anticancer drugs and photodynamic therapy will be very effective.
