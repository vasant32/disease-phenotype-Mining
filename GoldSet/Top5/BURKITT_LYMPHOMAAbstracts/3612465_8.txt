Current surgical teaching advocates debulking of the abdominal Burkitt's lymphoma to decrease tumor burden and improve survival. The records of 16 children who had Burkitt's lymphoma were reviewed. Eleven of these children presented with abdominal tumors. Five of these 11 patients are long-term survivors and six have died. Three of the tumors were primarily resected; two were in patients who became long-term survivors. One resection was complicated by acute renal failure, leading to the early demise of the patient. Four tumors were debulked; only one of these was in a long-term survivor. Acute renal failure also complicated the hospital course in one of these children. Finally, four patients underwent initial incisional biopsies and plans were made for subsequent resection of any residual tumor 6 weeks later. Two of these children survived and two have died. The results of this pilot study do not confirm that there is a clear advantage to aggressive operative cytoreduction. Although this approach decreases the total tumor burden, it may also impose severe metabolic complications and postpone the administration of chemotherapy. These results do suggest the need for a multi-institutional review of the surgical management of abdominal Burkitt's lymphoma.
