Stomach involvement is rare in American Burkitt's lymphoma. Three cases were noted in 66 patients, and all were associated with large left upper quadrant masses. The appearance of Burkitt's lymphoma of the stomach is similar to other lymphomas and consists of diffuse infiltration of the wall, mucosal thickening, ulcerations, and intra- and extragastric masses. Extension into the oesophagus was noted twice, and small bowel masses were associated with two cases. CT scanning and ultrasound are useful for defining extragastric extent of tumour. Rapid reversion to a more normal appearance is noted following chemotherapy.
