Bcl-2 protects cells against Ras-mediated apoptosis; this protection coincides with its binding to Ras. However, the protection mechanism has remained enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that, upon apoptotic stimulation, newly synthesized Bcl-2 redistributes to mitochondria, interacts there with activated Ras, and blocks Ras-mediated apoptotic signaling. We also show, by employing bcl-2 mutants, that the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 binds to Ras and regulates its anti-apoptotic activity. Experiments with a C-terminal-truncated Ras or a farnesyltransferase inhibitor demonstrate that the CAAX motif of Ras is essential for apoptotic signaling and Bcl-2 association. The results indicate a potential mechanism by which Bcl-2 protects cells against Ras-mediated apoptotic signaling.
