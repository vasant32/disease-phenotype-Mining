Translocation (14;14)(q11;q32) was associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a child. The B-cell lineage of the leukemic cells led us to perform FISH studies, which showed that the chromosomal breakpoints were telomeric to TCRA/D and IGH loci. These findings show that FISH analyses are necessary when unusual features are associated with a recurrent translocation.
