Twenty-seven children with abdominal Burkitt's lymphoma (stage III), who had achieved complete remission, were entered into a prospective controlled trial of adjunct treatment with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific transfer factor (TF). Two patients treated with TF and 2 controls relapsed early (less than or equal to 12 weeks). Two out of 12 TF-treated patients and 5 out of 11 controls subsequently suffered relapses. Time to first late relapse was longer among TF-treated patients (p = 0.08), and no late relapse occurred while a patient was receiving TF treatment. Thus it seems that specific TF might be useful in the management of endemic Burkitt's lymphoma and also in the treatment of other virus-associated cancers and diseases.
