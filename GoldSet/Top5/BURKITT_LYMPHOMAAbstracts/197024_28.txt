The physical state of the intracellular Epstein-Barr virus DNA was characterized in four human lymphoblastoid cell lines, F-265, NC-37, U-303 L, and PG-1, derived from individuals without lymphoproliferative disease. For comparison, a previously investigated Burkitt lymphoma line, Raji, and a more recently established cell line of that origin, Rael, were also studied. The techniques employed were CsCl density gradient centrifugation, glycerol gradient centrifugation, and ethidium bromide-CsCl density gradient centrifugation in combination with nucleic acid hybridization, as well as electron microscopy contour length measurements of purified circular EBV DNA. All six cell lines contained multiple copies of covalently closed circular EBV DNA-molecules of the same size, as well as viral DNA with the properties of integrated DNA. No differences could be detected between the forms of EBV DNA present in cell lines derived from non-malignant sources and those present in lymphoma lines.
