Changes in inositol lipid and diacylglycerol metabolism have been analysed in Daudi lymphoma cells treated up to 24 h with human DNA recombinant interferon alpha. Results showing a different response of nuclear phosphoinositides and diacylglycerol, compared to whole cells, suggest that the intranuclear signalling system activated by interferon in Daudi cells involves nuclear inositol lipid metabolism. A well-characterized clone of Daudi cells selected for resistance to the antiproliferative action of interferon provided controls for the specificity of results.
