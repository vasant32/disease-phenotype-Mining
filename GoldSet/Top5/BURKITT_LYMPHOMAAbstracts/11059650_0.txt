Recent studies have shown marked geographic variation associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in pediatric Burkitt's lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease. In the present study we investigated 30 cases of pediatric extranodal high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) from Turkey with an abdominal localisation. To classify them histologically and to determine the role of EBV in these lymphomas, immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridisation (ISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used. Our series contained two histologic types: the Burkitt's or Burkitt's-like lymphomas (BL/BLL) and high grade NHL. They all were of the B cell type. The immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement revealed monoclonality in 87% of the BL/BLL cases, in contrast to the NHL cases, showing monoclonality in only 43% of the cases. EBV was found in tumor cells in a high frequency, independent of the histological subtype. EBV strains A and B were detected in 9 cases, with a preponderance of the B subtype (4/9 BL/BLL; 4/9 NHL). Our data suggest that high grade NHLs with abdominal localisation of Turkish children show the pattern of immunodeficient lymphomas to some extent.
