The purpose of this study is to report a rare case of primary meningeal high grade Burkitt-type lymphoma presenting as the first clinical manifestation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A 38-year-old Caucasian man, with a negative past medical history, sought treatment after experiencing global headache for five days. CT-Scan revealed a right front-temporo-parietal hyperdense subdural expansive mass. A craniotomy was performed and a hard white subdural was microsurgically dissected. Some hours after the surgery, the patient developed hemispheric cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension syndrome. Decompressive craniotomy was performed and the patient had an excellent recovery. Screening blood tests diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus infection. Further investigation ruled out systemic diseases. Eleven days after the initial surgery, the patient developed an acute respiratory failure and sepsis, dying on that day. Pathological studies diagnosed Burkitt-type lymphoma.
