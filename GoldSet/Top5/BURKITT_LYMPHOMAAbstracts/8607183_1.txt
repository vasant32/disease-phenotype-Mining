Comparative cell transfer experiments have revealed that, despite their equal immune deficiency, C3H/SCID mice were markedly inferior compared with C.B-17/SCID mice in their ability to accept allogeneic and xenogeneic grafts. Allogeneic C.B-17/SCID bone marrow cells were engrafted poorly compared with syngeneic C3H/SCID when transplanted into C3H/SCID recipients, whereas cells of both strains were equally well engrafted into C.B-17/SCID mice. C.B-17/SCID mice were much more permissive for outgrowth of human Burkitt lymphoma (Raji), as well as for Epstein-Barr virus lymphoma development after transplantation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Human skin grafts were accepted by the C.B-17/SCID mice but were promptly rejected by the C3H/SCID mice. The resistance to human RaJi cells could be adoptively transferred by infusion of C3H/SCID splenocytes into C.B-17/SCID mice. Because the C.B-17/SCID and C3H/SCID mice equally lack both T and B lymphocytes, the latter may provide a relevant model for studies of non-T mechanisms of allograft or xenograft rejection.
