Eighteen Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines were analyzed for rearrangement and expression of the delta gene. None had rearrangement of the delta gene locus within the 9.0-kb BamHI restriction fragment. Cell lines that expressed the delta gene contained both mu alleles, with at least one productively rearranged. Thirteen of 18 cell lines had detectable transcripts hybridizing with the delta probe. In 10 of the 13 cell lines with delta transcripts, cytoplasmic delta chains were detected, but only two of these expressed delta chains strongly on the surface. All 13 lines made cytoplasmic mu chains, and all except one made cytoplasmic light chains. Surface IgM was detected in all except two of the 13 cell lines. Although BL has generally been considered not to express IgD, except in occasional cases, previous studies have been confined to examination of the cell surface. Many of the cell lines that we examined express delta mRNA transcripts as well as produce cytoplasmic delta chains but no detectable surface IgD. This suggests that delta chains are detectable in the cytoplasm prior to being apparent on the surface. Our findings argue against an origin of BL from germinal center cells since IgD is almost totally lacking in normal B cells present in germinal centers.
