A patient with Burkitt's lymphoma is described who, on presentation, had a bone marrow aspirate which did not show abnormal cells. Cells from the bone marrow were cultured and an 8;14 chromosome translocation was identified. This finding allowed us to upgrade the stage of disease from III to IV with therapeutic as well as prognostic implications.
