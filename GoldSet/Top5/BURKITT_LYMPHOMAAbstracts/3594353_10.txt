The toxicity of high dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) in 23 leukemic children aged 1.5 years to 16 years 11 months was evaluated. The group included 11 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), nine with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL), two with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) in blastic crisis, and one with Burkitt's lymphoma. Toxicity consisted of bone marrow suppression in all patients, with a mean nadir time of 11 days for platelets and granulocytes. All patients experienced nausea and vomiting; 12 of 23 had drug induced fever; seven of 23 conjunctivitis; five of 23 mucositis; four of 23 diarrhea, and one of 23 elevated transaminase with hyperbilirubinemia. Adverse reactions were mild and reversible in all patients. No serious neurologic toxicity was seen. The toxicity observed in four patients with prior cranial irradiation was not any different from nonirradiated patients. The only life-threatening effect was neutropenia, the consequences of which were generally well controlled with antibiotic therapy. While this agent was effective in induction of remission in AML patients resistant to standard doses of Ara-C, it had no significant effect in a very small number of patients with relapsed ALL and CML in blast crisis. Side effects of high dose Ara-C though relatively substantial are manageable enough to warrant wider scale efficacy trials of this agent in childhood leukemias and solid tumors.
