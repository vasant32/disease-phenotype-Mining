Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and naso-pharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are tumors generally believed to be associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Algerian population could be considered at high risk for BL-EBV association. In a series of 34 BL patients observed by us between 1982 and 1984 characteristics were: 70% of children were under 5 years age, abdominal location in 90% of cases (n = 30), 13% only isolated, massive tumor burden (70% stage III after Murphy, 30% stage IV after Murphy and Duque-Hammershaimb), EBV serology titers above or equal to 640 in 60% of cases (anti-EBNA and anti-VCA) and 50% (anti-EA) respectively, presence of EBNA antigen in tumor cells found in 63% of cases, no complete correlation between serology positivity and EBNA presence.
