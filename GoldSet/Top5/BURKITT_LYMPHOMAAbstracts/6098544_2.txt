The aim of this study was to test whether EBV induction by TPA or n-butyrate was related directly to hyperexpression of Ii, an electrophoretically invariant, 35 000 dalton, HLA-DR antigen-associated glycoprotein which is abundantly detected in EBV freshly transformed cells and is enhanced by EBV superinfection of lymphoblastoid cell lines. P3HR-1 lymphoblasts were treated with n-butyrate or TPA in variable doses and durations. The augmented expression of Ii, EBV antigens (EA and VCA), DNA synthesis, and cell growth and viability were monitored. n-Butyrate induced hyperexpression of Ii at 2 days with a maximal effective dose of 4 mM, induced EBV antigens (EA and VCA) in 36 per cent of the cells at 2 days, inhibited DNA synthesis and cell growth, and was not cytolytic at 48 h when Ii induction was maximal. TPA did not induce hyperexpression of Ii, induced EBV antigens (EA) in 30 per cent of the cells at 4 days, did not inhibit DNA synthesis and cell growth, and was not cytolytic in the time course and doses studied. Ii expression, therefore, did not appear to be an obligatory consequence of EBV antigen induction. Ii induction might be related to an effect of EBV inducers on cellular DNA synthesis, or on control of the cell cycle, or directly upon Ii gene regulation.
