After ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the second noninvasive powerful method of examining the heart. The findings in 9 patients with cardiac tumors are reported, who were examined by means of MRI: There was little variance in the MRI signal behavior (with only one exception), although the tumor population examined was very heterogeneous. The MRI techniques used (T1-weighted spin echo, steady-state gradient echo) seem to allow no better tumor specification than ultrasound. Wince multiplanar reconstruction is possible with MRI, tumor size, localization, and the borders of the cardiac neoplasms can be depicted. The cine technique provides dynamic information. In addition, this method allows reliable discrimination between the flow effects and true space-occupying lesions.
