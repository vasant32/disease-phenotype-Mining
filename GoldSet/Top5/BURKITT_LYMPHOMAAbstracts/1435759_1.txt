The association of the human epsilon-globin gene with the nuclear matrix was studied in erythroid and non-erythroid cell lines. Using a high salt method to prepare histone depleted nuclei we studied the association of variety of fragments covering a 7.8 kb region which contains the human epsilon-globin gene. We furthermore studied the association of a set of DNA fragments covering the 13 kb human G gamma/A gamma-globin gene domain, the 16 kb psi beta/delta-globin gene domain and the 10 kb beta-globin gene domain with the nuclear matrix of K562 and Raji cells. The results show that all fragments studied are easily released from the nuclear matrix, indicating no specific association. Summarizing our results we could say that a region starting 5.7 kb 5' to the human epsilon-globin gene and ending 4 kb 3' to the human beta-globin gene seems to contain no attachment sites with the nuclear matrix of both erythroid and non-erythroid cells.
