Invasive fungal sinusitis in the pediatric population appears to be a relatively rare entity. An increasing incidence has been noted in accordance with the widespread use of antibiotics, steroids, antineoplastic drugs and radiation therapy. Three illustrative cases are described which outline the initial presenting symptoms, findings on physical examination, computed tomography (CT), intraoperative findings, and histopathologic findings. A review of the literature is presented and a treatment protocol is proposed once a diagnosis is made. Early suspicion and diagnosis are the most important prerequisites for successful treatment which consists of control of the underlying disease, surgical debridement, and systemic antifungal therapy. Cooperation between the otolaryngologist, pediatric specialists, and pathologists are key to the survival of children with invasive fungal sinusitis. Survival in this series was dependent upon return of an immune competent state.
