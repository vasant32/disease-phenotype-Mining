 BACKGROUND: Burkitt's lymphoma is extremely rare in the United States, with reports of approximately 300 new cases each year. A case of Burkitt's lymphoma involving the uterus, cervix, ovaries and appendix 15 years after adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer is presented. CASE REPORT: A 58-year-old woman presented with an abdominal mass. MRI revealed a pelvic mass originating from the uterus. Her past medical history was significant for an infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast with positive lymph nodes and extra nodal invasion diagnosed at age 43. She had a left modified radical mastectomy in 1990 with adjuvant chemotherapy. Histologic sections of the uterus, cervix, ovaries, appendix and external iliac lymph node obtained at laparotomy revealed diffuse neoplastic lymphoid infiltration with necrosis. Light microscopy revealed starry sky patterns and immunohistochemical staining demonstrated atypical lymphocytes which stained for CD20, CD10, bcl-6, and Ki-67. After complete staging, chemotherapy was started and the patient is presently tumor free 41 months after the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Burkitt's lymphoma arising from the uterus/cervix is extremely rare and may present as a pelvic mass. Early diagnosis, aggressive chemotherapy, +/-surgical intervention, plays an important role in management and survival of patients with Burkitt's lymphoma.
