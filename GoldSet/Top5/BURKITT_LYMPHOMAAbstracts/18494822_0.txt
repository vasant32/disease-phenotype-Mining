Granulocytic sarcoma is an extramedullary tumor of immature cells of granulocytic series, generally associated to acute myelogenous leukemia. The skin is one of the most commonly affected sites. Granulocytic sarcoma can complicate myelodysplastic syndromes and is considered a sign of poor prognosis. They are often misdiagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the lymphoblastic type, Burkitt lymphoma and large cell lymphoma. In children, the differential diagnoses also include small, round cell tumors. It is important to diagnose these lesions early because they can precede peripheral blood and bone marrow transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia. We report a case of an elderly patient with myelodysplastic syndrome who developed multiple cutaneous granulocytic sarcoma lesions and discuss prognostic and treatment implications.
