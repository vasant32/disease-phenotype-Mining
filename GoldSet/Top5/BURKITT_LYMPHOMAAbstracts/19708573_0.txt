AIM: To characterize clinical and epidemiological features of adult Berkitt's lymphoma (BL). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial enrolled 72 patients (51 males and 21 females, age 14-69, mean age 27 years) treated in 1995-2008. RESULTS: Stage I BL (by S.B. Murphy) was diagnosed in 5 patients, stage II--in 9, stage III--in 25, IV--in 14 patients, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (L3)--in 19 patients. Intoxication was seen in 56 (78%) patients, 38% patients had severe cachexia. Elevated concentration of lactatedehydrogenase (LDG) was detected in 57 (79%) patients. In all the cases clinical symptoms developed for 1-3 months, median 6 weeks. Bone marrow involvement was diagnosed in 22 (31%) patients, CNS was affected in 17 (24%) patients, of them 14 were males. Fifty two (72%) patients had abdominal, retroperitoneal and/or small pelvis tumors. Intestinal, hepatic, renal and gastric tumors occurred most frequently. Specific ascitis was detected in 25 (48%), tumor pleuritis--in 11 (15%) patients. BL of the facial skeleton, Waldeyer's ring, oro- and nasopharynx was in 12 (17%) patients. Seven patients had concomitant involvement of the CNS. Eight (38%) and 2 (10%) women had tumors of the ovaries and uterus, respectively. CONCLUSION: BL is characterized by the following clinical features: young age of the patients, most of them are males, B-symptoms, short history, generalized stages, extranodal lesions, firequent involvement of the bone marrow and CNS.
