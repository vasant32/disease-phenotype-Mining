Addition of either ATP or ouabain to the culture medium markedly depressed thymidine incorporation into DNA in Raji cells. The electromagnetic field, pulsating at very low frequency, did not affect DNA synthesis in normal culture media nor did it alter its ouabain-inhibition, but it partially reversed the ATP-inhibition. In spite of the presence of ATP, ouabain prevented stimulation of ATPase and DNA synthesis by the field. Although no mechanism is known for the action of either ATP or the field, the results may be interpreted in light of existing speculations. In the absence of the field, external ATP may go into an ATP pool that either blocks ATPase or feeds adenyl cyclase, which hinders DNA synthesis. In contrast, the electromagnetic field may either turn off adenyl cyclase or simply stimulate the ATP-depressed ATPase.
