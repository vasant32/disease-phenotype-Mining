It is widely known that IL-4 and IL-13 act on various kinds of cells, including B cells, resulting in enhancement of proliferation, class switching to IgE and expression of several surface proteins. These functions are important for the recognition of the various antigens in B cells and are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. However, it has not been known whether IL-4/IL-13 is involved in the metabolism of various kinds of xenobiotics including 2,3,7,8-tetra-chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and it remains undetermined whether TCDD, an environmental pollutant, influences IgE production in B cells, exaggerating allergic reactions. We identified IL-4- or IL-13-inducible genes in a human Burkitt lymphoma cell line, DND-39, using microarray technology, in which the AHR gene was included. The AHR gene product, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), was induced by IL-4 in both mouse and human B cells in a STAT6-dependent manner. IL-4 alone had the ability to translocate the induced AhR to the nuclei. TCDD, a ligand for AhR, rapidly degraded the induced AhR by the proteasomal pathway, although IL-4-activated AhR sustained its expression. AhR activated by IL-4 caused expression of a xenobiotic-metabolizing gene, CYP1A1, and TCDD synergistically acted on the induction of this gene by IL-4. However, the induction of AhR had no effect on IgE synthesis or CD23 expression. These results indicate that the metabolism of xenobiotics would be a novel biological function of IL-4 and IL-13 in B cells, whereas TCDD is not involved in IgE synthesis in B cells.
