Cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) have previously been successfully used in immunotherapy of Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) and Hodgkin's disease. A similar strategy has never been employed in HIV/AIDS patients who also have high risk of developing EBV-associated lymphoma. A total of 5 HIV-infected patients were enrolled to evaluate their EBV-specific T cell responses by Interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) ELISpot assays. Most patients had detectable T cell responses, mainly directed at Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA-3). The authors wanted to see whether it was possible to augment magnitude and spectrum of the EBV responses by stimulating patient PBMC with cells presenting autologous EBV antigens. The authors successfully established spontaneously EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBVh-BCL) and used them for generation of EBV-specific CTL (EBV-CTL). The EBVh-CTL lines established in the present study were not only highly cytotoxic against the autologous virus but also able to secrete IFNgamma detected by ELISpot. The authors are now in the process of generating these lines in a large number and in a clinical grade for adoptive immunotherapy.
