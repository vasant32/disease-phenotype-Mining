The majority of follicular lymphoma and Burkitt's lymphoma are associated with reciprocal translocations involving BCL2 and cMYC, respectively. Unusual reports of aggressive lymphoma presenting with both translocations have been described as well as rare cases with a third structural alteration usually involving BCL6. The patient described here presented with aggressive high-grade lymphocytic leukemia, FAB subtype L2 (ALL-L2), and three reciprocal translocations, t(14;18)(q32;q21), t(8;14)(q24.1;q32), and t(1;2) (q22-23;p13). Despite immature morphology the leukemic blasts had a mature B-cell phenotype; they were positive for surface immunoglobulin heavy chains and negative for CD34, TdT, and CD10. Most reported dual t(14;18)/t(8;14) cases have not shown sIg and were positive for CD10. Molecular genetic analyses showed the typical rearrangements of BCL2 and cMYC as well as the FCGR2B gene on chromosome 1q23. The occurrence of a third oncogene rearrangement in association with the dual BCL2, cMYC translocations in ALL patients is very rare. To our knowledge, this is the first case where the third hit involves the FCGR2B locus. This report reiterates the poor prognosis associated with activation of cMYC together with elevated Bcl-2 expression. These data also support recent evidence that dysregulation of FCGR2B may play a role in tumor progression.
