A 52-year-old man presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. A computed tomographic scan showed findings consistent with colo-colonic intussusception and ischemic bowel with evolving infarction. The intussuscepted portion of the colon was immediately resected. Pathology demonstrated a transverse colo-colonic intussusception with an intraluminal focus of Burkitt's lymphoma as the lead point. Transverse colonic intussusception is very rare and often presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms and as such is often not considered based on clinical findings alone. Computed tomography is the key to diagnosis, and it is important to recognize the imaging findings so that the appropriate surgery can be performed quickly.
