A histone mixture (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) derived from calf thymus stimulated IgM production by human-human hybridoma HB4C5 cells. On the contrary, the histone mixture did not increase IgM production by the human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line NAT-30, IgG production by the human B lymphoblastoid cell line HMy-2, and IgE production by the human myeloma cell line U266. The immunoglobulin production-stimulating activity of the histone mixture was inactivated by trypsin or chymotrypsin digestion. In addition, confocal laser microscopic analysis had shown that HB4C5 cells incorporated a lot of histone but other cell lines did not incorporate it as much. These facts strongly suggest that histone acts as an immunoglobulin production-stimulating factor (IPSF) after internalization into the human B cell lines and the native structure of histone is required for the IPSF activity.
