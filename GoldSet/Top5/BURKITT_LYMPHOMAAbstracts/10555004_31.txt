Few large series compare lymphomas of the nasal cavity with those of the paranasal sinuses. We studied the cases of 58 patients, 34 males and 24 females, aged 7 to 92 years (mean, 57 years), who had lymphoma involving the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses. Thirty-three patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Twenty-three were male and 10 were female, with an age range of 7 to 91 years (mean, 63 years); two were HIV-positive. Only 2 of 11 cases tested (one in an HIV-positive patient and one of lymphomatoid granulomatosis type) were Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive. Thirty (91%) involved paranasal sinuses, 10 with nasal involvement, whereas three cases had nasal, but not sinus, involvement. At last follow-up, 16 (67%) were free of disease 7 to 169 months later (mean, 65 months), and 8 (33%) had died of disease 2 to 166 months later (mean, 45 months). Seventeen patients had nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma. There were 10 women and 7 men, aged 27 to 78 years (mean, 48 years). Thirteen of 14 were EBV-positive. Sixteen patients had nasal involvement, eight with sinus involvement. Eleven (73%) of 15 were alive and well 6 to 321 months later (mean, 139 months), three (20%) died of lymphoma 1, 11, and 12 months later, and one (7%) is alive with disease. There was one case each of marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkitt-like lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma of unspecified type, and adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia. In an additional three cases, the lymphomas were composed predominantly of large cells, but no immunophenotyping could be performed for subclassification. In 19 cases (17 DLBCLs, 1 Burkitt-like lymphoma, and 1 lymphoma of uncertain lineage), presenting symptoms included complaints related to the eyes. In 16 cases (13 DLBCLs, 1 Burkitt-like lymphoma, 1 nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma, and 1 lymphoma of uncertain lineage), the orbit was invaded by lymphoma. In our series, the most common lymphoma to arise in the sinonasal area is DLBCL, followed by nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Comparison of these two types of lymphoma showed that lymphomas involving sinuses without nasal involvement were predominantly DLBCLs (20 of 21), whereas nasal cavity lymphomas without sinus involvement were usually NK/T-cell type (8 of 11) (p = 0.000125). Compared with patients with DLBCL, patients with nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma were overall younger, with a lower male-to-female ratio. Lymphomas of B-cell lineage were more likely to be associated with symptoms related to the eyes (p < 0.0005) and to have extension to the orbit (p < 0.01) than were lymphomas of T- or NK-cell lineage. In contrast to results of Asian studies in which nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma has a very poor prognosis, our nasal NK/T-cell lymphomas had an outcome similar to that of DLBCL.
