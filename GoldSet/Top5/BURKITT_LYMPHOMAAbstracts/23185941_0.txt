 AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate trends of prevalence and the pathological spectrum of head and neck lymphomas (HNL) at Tygerberg Referral Hospital over five years from 2003 to 2007, and to ascertain a possible relationship with HIV infection. This study will also provide a source of baseline data for a further project that will include the last ten years at Tygerberg Hospita i.e. 2003 to 2012. OBJECTIVES: To establish the incidence and trends of prevalence of HNL; to describe the pathological spectrum of all HNICs diagnosed from 2003 to 2007. METHOD: A retrospective study was conducted using the case records of all newly diagnosed HNL specimens from 2003 to 2007. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase was noted in the number of patients presenting with HNL. An increase from 17% to 33% was also noted in the number of HIV-positive HNL patients during the same period. The average age of disease presentation in the HIV-positive group of patients was significantly lower Diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was the largest category of HNL (32%), followed by Hodgkin lymphomas (HL) 27%, Folicular lymphoma (FL) 10% and Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) at 8%. PBL and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) were seen only in HIV-positive patients. CONCLUSION: There was an increase in the number of HNLs diagnosed each year.
