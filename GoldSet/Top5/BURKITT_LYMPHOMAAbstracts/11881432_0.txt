Burkitt's lymphoma is a tumour often associated with low immunity as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (l3) or infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The incidence of renal affection is variable (34-62%) and there are different aetiologies. We present a case of acute renal failure in a patient with a Burkitt's lymphoma and renal infiltration, and infected by the human immunodeficiency virus.
