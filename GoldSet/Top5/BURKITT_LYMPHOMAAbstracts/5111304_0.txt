Procedures used to produce an established line of mammalian cells (L cell) in a New Brunswick fermentor were adapted to propagate human lymphoid cells in suspended culture. Control of pH within defined limits was more effective for regulation of cell metabolism than control of oxidation-reduction potential. An unusually high rate of agitation was required.
