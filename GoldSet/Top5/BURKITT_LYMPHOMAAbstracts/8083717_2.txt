PURPOSE AND METHODS: Thirty-nine consecutive children (age, 2 to 11 years) with nonlymphoblastic (NL) lymphomas were treated uniformly with chemotherapy based on the LNH-II-85 protocol. The protocol consisted of a remission-induction phase that lasted 30 days and started with cyclophosphamide (CTX) 1.2 g/m2 on day 1, followed by vincristine (VCR) 1.5 mg/m2 on days 3, 10, 17, and 24, daunomycin (DAUNO) 60 mg/m2 on days 12 and 13, and prednisone 40 mg/m2/d for 30 days. If a complete remission was achieved, an intensification regimen was given that consisted of eight courses of teniposide (VM-26) 165 mg/m2 plus cytarabine (ARA-C) 300 mg/m2 every 4 days according to bone marrow tolerance. A continuation phase was subsequently started, with alternating courses of thioguanine (6-TG) 300 mg/m2/d for 4 days plus CTX 1.2 g/m2 on day 5; hydroxyurea 2.5 g/m2/d for 4 days plus DAUNO 45 mg/m2 on day 5; VCR 1.5 mg/m2 plus methotrexate (MTX) 120 mg/m2 (24 hours apart); mercaptopurine (6-MP) 500 mg/m2/d for 4 days plus MTX 40 mg/m2; and VM-26 plus ARA-C for 3 courses (4 days apart), by the end of 48 weeks. CNS prophylaxis consisted of intrathecal administration of MTX, ARA-C, and dexamethasone according to age, administered three times during remission induction and every 6 weeks afterwards. RESULTS: By the end of the analysis in July 1991, 38 of 39 patients had attained a complete remission and 36 were event-free survivors. Two failures that occurred after completion of therapy were second malignancies (acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia). CONCLUSION: These results are significantly better than those obtained with less intensive former regimens performed in our institution before the availability of VM-26. The favorable impact of an intense consolidation phase with VM-26 is remarkably exemplified by three additional patients not included in this study whose families withdrew them from therapy after the intensification phase, all three of whom have been in remission.
