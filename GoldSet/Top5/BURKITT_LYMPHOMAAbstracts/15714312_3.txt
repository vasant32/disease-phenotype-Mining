Nephromegaly and non-oliguric acute renal failure is an unusual manifestation of lymphoblastic infiltration of the kidneys. We report the clinical history of a female child where a precursor B-cell lymphoblastic proliferation was diagnosed at the age of 21 months by a surgical renal biopsy for an unexplained bilateral nephromegaly. Lymphoblastic infiltration should be suspected in any patient presenting with unexplained renal failure and enlarged kidneys. The importance of renal biopsy to identify the etiology of renal failure and nephromegaly is emphasized.
