Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is prevalent in all human populations and high titers of antibody correlate with specific malignancies such as Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Our study detected EBV DNA in 20 of 21 penile tumor samples using PCR reaction. Expression of EBV protein LMP-1 was identified in tumor cells from two EBV PCR-positive tumors. Our findings indicate that EBV can be implicated in rising and/or progression of penile tumors independently of the histological type.
