A 57-year-old man developed complete bilateral ophthalmoplegia over a period of 10 days, together with bilateral facial pain and numbness of the chin. He had no other clinical manifestations. Findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging and spinal fluid formula from the first lumbar puncture were normal, but cerebrospinal fluid flow cytometry disclosed a kappa restriction monoclonal B-cell population, indicating malignant lymphoma. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis then revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes. Biopsy of an inguinal node showed findings consistent with Burkitt lymphoma. Within six weeks, intravenous and intrathecal chemotherapy resolved all neurologic findings except a partial right-side sixth nerve palsy and mild chin numbness. Eighteen months after disease onset, the patient remained in remission. Meningeal spread of Burkitt lymphoma is not commonly a presenting feature in immunocompetent adults. Chin numbness, a characteristic feature caused by infiltration of the mental nerve, should facilitate earlier recognition, which may be life saving.
