A PRoliferation-Inducing TNF Ligand (APRIL) costimulates B-cell activation. When overexpressed in mice, APRIL induces B-cell neoplasia, reminiscent of human B-cell chronic lymphoid leukemia (B-CLL). We analyzed APRIL expression in situ in human non-Hodgkin lymphomas. APRIL up-regulation was only observed in high-grade B-cell lymphomas, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and Burkitt lymphoma (BL). Up-regulation was seen in 46% and 20% of DLBCL and BL, respectively. In DLBCL, neutrophils, constitutively producing APRIL and infiltrating the tumor tissue, were the main cellular source of APRIL. Rare DLBCL cases showed a predominance of histiocytes or mesenchymal cells as APRIL source. APRIL secreted by neutrophils accumulated on tumor cells via proteoglycan binding. In addition to proteoglycans, DLBCL tumor cells expressed the APRIL signaling receptor, TACI and/or BCMA, indicating that these tumor cells are fully equipped to respond to APRIL. A retrospective clinical analysis revealed a significant correlation between high expression of APRIL in tumor lesions and decreased overall patient survival rate. Hence, APRIL produced by inflammatory cells infiltrating lymphoma lesions may increase tumor aggressiveness and affect disease outcome.
