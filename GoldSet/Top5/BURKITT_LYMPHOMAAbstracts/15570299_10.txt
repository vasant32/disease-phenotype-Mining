We report two new cases with the t(6;8)(q27;p12) and FGFR1OP-FGFR1 fusion. Case 1 presented with polycythaemia vera (PV) and evolved over 4 years to a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) resembling the 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome (EMS). Case 2 presented with B-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL). These cases illustrate the clinical heterogeneity observed in patients with FGFR1 rearrangements and suggest that constitutively activated tyrosine kinases may be more widespread in MPDs.
