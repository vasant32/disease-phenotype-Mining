Recent introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is reported to have reduced the incidence of lymphoma among HIV-infected individuals. A clinicopathological study was performed on 86 AIDS-related lymphoma patients who were treated in Tokyo area from 1987 to 2005. The incidence of lymphoma detected by autopsy was 27% (53 cases/198 autopsies). Diffuse large B cell lymphoma was the most predominant histological subtype throughout the period (78%). Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) increased from 2% in the pre-HAART era (before end-1997) to 13% in the HAART era, whereas incidence of BL did not vary between HAART users and non-users. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive lymphoma decreased from 88% in the pre-HAART era to 58% in the HAART era, but did not differ significantly between HAART users (73%) and non-users (74%). Nodal involvement of lymphoma increased from 14% in the pre-HAART era to 50% in the HAART era; however, central nervous system involvement decreased from 62 to 38%. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection was rare (4%) among all cases. These data suggest that HAART might play a partial role in these changes, and the alteration in immunological backgrounds, such as EBV prevalence, is suggested as another leading cause of these changes in Japanese AIDS-related lymphoma.
