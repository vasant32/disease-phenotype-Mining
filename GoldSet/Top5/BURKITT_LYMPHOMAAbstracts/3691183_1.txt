Mouse Pvt-1 and rat MIS1 are frequent proviral integration sites in retrovirally induced lymphomas. The Pvt-1 locus is also involved in mouse plasmacytoma (6;15) and in the variant Burkitt lymphoma (2;8) translocations. We show that the Pvt-1/MIS1 locus is syntenic with MYC on rat chromosome 7. This is consistent with a postulate of close linkage and, possibly, a functional relationship between the MYC protooncogene and the MIS1/Pvt-1 locus.
