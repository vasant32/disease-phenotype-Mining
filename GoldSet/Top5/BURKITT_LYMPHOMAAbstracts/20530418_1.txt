 BACKGROUND: Loss of p53 renders cells more susceptible to acute oxidant stress induced by oxidant-generating agents such as motexafin gadolinium (MGd). We hypothesized that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating MGd results in low-level p53 expression, making cells more susceptible to oxidant stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lymphoma cells were incubated with different concentrations of MGd with or without zinc (Zn) and ascorbate, and ROS, apoptosis, proteins, and oxidant genes were measured. RESULTS: MGd, with ascorbate and Zn, induced apoptosis in lymphoma cells. This was accompanied by reduction of p53 protein but not message, and by reduction of p53 downstream targets p21, glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), and p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). p53 protein reduction was reversed by MG132, and nutlin-3. CONCLUSION: Our data are consistent with a pathway of cell death that is independent of p53-mediated induction of PUMA; the cellular response to reduce p53 represents a cell survival adjustment to ROS-mediated stress.
