Optimum conditions for growth and interferon production by a human lymphoblastoid cell line, Namalva, have been studied. Adaptation to large-scale production is possible utilizing either Sendai virus or Newcastle disease virus. Priming of cultures before induction is unnecessary. The interferon produced has properties similar to human leukocyte interferon. The production of lymphoblastoid interferon per cell is increased two- to fourfold after dilution with serum-free medium of a saturation-density culture of Namalva induced with Newcastle disease virus. Maximum interferon yields were obtained 27 h after the addition of virus, using cultures diluted to 4 X 10(5) to 9 X 10(5) cells per ml. The presence of glutamine in the dilution medium was required for maximum interferon production. Newcastle disease virus appeared to inhibit the rates of RNA and protein synthesis more effectively in the diluted cultures.
