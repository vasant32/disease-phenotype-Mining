Epstein-Barr virus associated lymphoproliferative disease after autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) has rarely been reported. We report a case of B-cell lymphoma following ABMT for T-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; bone marrow was purged in vitro with monoclonal antibodies to remove T cells. Immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies were used to demonstrate clonality and to show that this patient developed a second neoplasm after ABMT. EBV proteins and genome (type A) were present in post-transplantation lymphoma, suggesting a causative role in its development.
