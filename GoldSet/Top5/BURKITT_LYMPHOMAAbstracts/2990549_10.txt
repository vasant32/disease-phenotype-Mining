Epstein-Barr (EB) virus induces a new pyrimidine deoxynucleoside kinase [thymidine kinase (dTk)] activity in Raji B lymphocyte cells after superinfection. This dTk activity is also present in small amounts in the HR-1 virus-producer cell line and in larger amounts in the B95-8 virus-producer line. The dTk activity induced by EB virus coelutes from DEAE-cellulose columns with deoxycytidine kinase (dCk) activity and elutes as a broad peak well separated from the large peaks of cellular dTk and dCk activities. This EB virus-induced pyrimidine deoxynucleoside kinase activity from HR-1 cells differs from cellular kinases in most basic biochemical properties but shares certain properties with the herpes simplex virus dTk.
