Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Plasmodium falciparum have overlapping distributions and are thought to have causal interactions, particularly with regard to the aetiology of endemic Burkitt's lymphoma. Using real-time PCR, we quantified and compared EBV DNA levels in the blood before and after antimalarial treatment of age- and gender-matched groups of Gabonese children who presented with either mild or severe P. falciparum malaria. Following treatment, the prevalence of EBV DNA declined in the mild malaria group but increased in the severe malaria group, and a significantly higher proportion of the latter had EBV DNA detectable in their blood when they were healthy and parasite free (67% vs. 39%; P=0.013). High EBV DNA loads were associated with more malaria attacks and with elevated plasma concentrations of both TNF-alpha and IL-12p40. Significantly more under 5 year olds had EBV DNA, highlighting the strong age dependence of the interaction between the two pathogens. These findings confirm that EBV is reactivated during acute P. falciparum malaria but, importantly, also reveal that: (i) EBV activity persists at a higher frequency in children with a history of severe malaria; and (ii) higher peripheral blood EBV DNA loads are associated with susceptibility to more frequent P. falciparum episodes and with altered cytokine activity.
