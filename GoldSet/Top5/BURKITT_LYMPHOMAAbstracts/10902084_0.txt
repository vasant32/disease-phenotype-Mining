Malignant lymphoma is one of the most common hematological diseases of children. The prognosis is fairly good with multimodal cancer therapy. We reported a boy with Burkitt's lymphoma in the nasal cavity who received chemotherapy and irradiation of the head and neck area at four years of age. During seven years of follow-up, we studied the developmental effects of cancer therapy, including general growth, maxillofacial bones, and dentition. Compared with boys of matching age, the development of his entire body and maxillofacial bones was delayed. In the irradiated areas, the roots of teeth were short or poorly developed and the root apices showed premature closure. After the patient was in remission from the tumor in his early childhood, the long-term effects of cancer therapy on dental and maxillofacial development are worth our further evaluation and follow-up.
