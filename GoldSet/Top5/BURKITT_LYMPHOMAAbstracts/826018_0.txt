Cells of KMPG-1 and SPG-2 cultures obtained from the bone marrow and spleen of baboon hamadryads with hemoblastosis produce herpes-like virus (HLV) having the density of 1.21 and 1.27 g/cm3 in sucrose and cesium chloride density gradients. The density of nucleocapsids is 1.26 and 1.30 g/cm3 correspondingly. The HLV DNA sedimentation constant- 54 +/- 3S, and its density 1.717 g/cm3. The sera of patients with Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma can bind H3-thymidine labelled HLV that evidences a close antigenic relationship between HLV and NV virus.
