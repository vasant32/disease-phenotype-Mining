Two plasmids encoding resistance to hygromycin-B or to the analog of neomycin, G418, and containing either one or two copies of the plasmid origin of replication, oriP, of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were introduced into an EBV-positive B-lymphoblastoid cell line. Two clones of cells containing both plasmids were analyzed for the number of copies of each plasmid when the cells were propagated in the absence or in the presence of one or both selective agents. Under all conditions tested, the plasmid with two copies of oriP behaved in cells as did the plasmid with one copy of this plasmid origin of replication.
