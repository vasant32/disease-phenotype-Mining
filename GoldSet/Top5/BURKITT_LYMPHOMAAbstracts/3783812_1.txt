Twenty-four children with a diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma were seen at Jordan University Hospital during a 6 year period (1978-1983). Their median age was 4 years and the male to female ratio was 3:1. A space clustering of cases was evident. Abdominal mass was the commonest presentation being observed in 21 patients, while only two patients presented with jaw masses. Sixteen patients had advanced disease (stages C and D). Chemotherapy was the basic form of therapy given. Twelve children (50%) survived. Advanced stage and poor nutritional status at diagnosis correlated with poor outcome. Our data indicate that Burkitt's lymphoma in Jordanian children presents an intermediate type that shares some similarities with both the endemic (African) and non-endemic types.
