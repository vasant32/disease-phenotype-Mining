Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is etiologically associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV-positive BL tumors display two latent forms of infection. One is referred to as latency I infection, in which EBV expresses the virus genome maintenance protein EBNA1 as the only viral protein. The other is referred to as Wp-restricted latency and was recently identified in a subset of BL tumors. In these tumors, EBV expresses EBNA1, EBNA3A, EBNA3B, EBNA3C, a truncated form of EBNA-LP, and the viral Bcl-2 homologue BHRF1, all of which are driven by the BamHI W promoter (Wp). To investigate the role of EBV in Wp-restricted BL, we conditionally expressed a dominant-negative EBNA1 (dnEBNA1) mutant which interrupts the virus genome maintenance function of EBNA1 in the P3HR-1 BL cell line. Induction of dnEBNA1 expression caused loss of the EBV genome and resulted in apoptosis of P3HR-1 cells in the absence of exogenous apoptosis inducers, indicating that P3HR-1 cells cannot survive without EBV. Stable transfection of the BHRF1 gene into P3HR-1 cells rescued the cells from the apoptosis induced by dnEBNA1 expression, whereas stable transfection of truncated EBNA-LP, EBNA3A, or EBNA3C did not. Moreover, knockdown of BHRF1 expression in P3HR-1 cells resulted in increased cell death. These results indicate that EBV is essential for the survival of P3HR-1 cells and that BHRF1 functions as a survival factor. Our finding implies a critical contribution of BHRF1 to the pathogenesis of Wp-restricted BLs.
