Stem cell factor (SCF) triggers cell growth by binding to cell surface c-kit receptors. Soluble forms of several cytokine receptors have been described and may play a role in the modulation of cytokine activity in vivo. For these reasons, we investigated whether human hematopoietic cells produce soluble c-kit receptors. The human leukemia cell lines OCIM1 and MO7e display approximately 80,000 and approximately 35,000 high-affinity cell surface c-kit receptors, respectively. Soluble c-kit receptors were detected by enzyme immunoassay in OCIM1 and MO7e culture supernatants. We determined the molecular weight and binding affinity of soluble c-kit receptor produced by OCIM1 cells, soluble c-kit receptor purified from human serum, and recombinant soluble c-kit receptor expressed in CHO cells. The three soluble c-kit receptors each have a molecular weight of 98 kD. Quantitative binding experiments with 125I-SCF indicate that the soluble c-kit receptors obtained from human serum or OCIM1 cells have binding affinities for SCF of approximately 200 to 300 pmol/L, in contrast to the recombinant form, which has a binding affinity of approximately 1.5 nmol/L. All three forms of the soluble c-kit receptor were able to compete with c-kit receptors on OCIM1 cells for 125I-SCF binding. Thus human hematopoietic cells can produce a soluble form of the c-kit receptor that retains high-affinity SCF binding activity. We speculate that the soluble c-kit receptor may bind SCF and function as a receptor antagonist in vivo.
