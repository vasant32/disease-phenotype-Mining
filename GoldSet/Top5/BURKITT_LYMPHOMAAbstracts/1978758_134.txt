All human gamma delta T cells coexpressing the products of the variable (V) region T cell receptor (TCR) gene segments V gamma 9 and V delta 2 recognize antigens from mycobacterial extracts and Daudi cells. Exogenous and endogenous ligands on the cell surface, homologous to the groEL heat shock family, induced reactivities that resembled superantigen responses in this major subset of human peripheral blood gamma delta T cells. Stimulation of human V gamma 9/V delta 2 T cells is not restricted by human leukocyte antigens (HLA), including nonpolymorphic beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M)-associated class Ib molecules. These data may be important for understanding the role of gamma delta T cells in autoimmunity and in responses to microorganisms and tumors.
