The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the use of the variable regions of the T gamma rearranging gene of the second T cell receptor. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukemic cells of T and B precursor phenotypes and hybridized to probes that detect rearrangement of the V gamma regions. We present data showing that the V gamma use is nonrandom in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). B precursor ALL rearranged the more 5' variable regions. The results obtained suggest that the T precursor leukemias more frequently rearrange the 3' V gamma regions. Two leukemias that expressed the gamma protein rearranged V gamma 8 and V gamma 9.
