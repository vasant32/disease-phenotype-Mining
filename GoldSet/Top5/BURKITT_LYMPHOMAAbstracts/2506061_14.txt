Class switch of immunoglobulin from mu to gamma occurs by recombination between two repetitive switch sequences: S mu and S gamma. However, there are no such sequences in the mu-delta introns of human and mouse genomes. Although the frequency of IgD-secreting cells is extremely low in mouse about 1% of patients with myeloma produce IgD in human. In a previous report (Nucleic Acids Res. 1988. 16: 9497) we reported that a 442-bp DNA sequence located in the JH-mu intron (defined as sigma mu) was inserted into the mu-delta intron (defined as sigma mu) in human genome. There is no such insertion in mouse. We analyzed Ig H chain gene loci of two human IgD myelomas: one was analyzed by cloning and sequencing and the other by Southern hybridization. We found that recombination had occurred between these two homologous DNA sequences, resulting in loss of the DNA segment from sigma mu to sigma mu. On the other hand, in a Burkitt lymphoma, Daudi, the DNA fragment from sigma mu to sigma mu was duplicated. These results suggest that homologous recombination between sigma mu and sigma mu sequences mediates class switch from mu to delta in human and that it occurs via unequal crossing-over between sister chromatids or daughter chromosomes.
