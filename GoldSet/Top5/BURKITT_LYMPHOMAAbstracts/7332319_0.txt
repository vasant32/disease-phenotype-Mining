The interaction of C3 with different tumour cell lines was investigated. Our results indicated that nearly all the cell lines had C3b acceptors on their membranes. The binding of C3b was visualized by the detection of this protein on the cell surface with fluoresceinated anti-C3c serum. The involvement of proteases in the activation of C3 was demonstrated: complement-membrane fluorescence occurred in the presence of EDTA but was completely abolished with epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Experiments performed with purified C3 led to the conclusion that the protease activity might be the initial event for the activation of the alternative pathway by tumour cells.
