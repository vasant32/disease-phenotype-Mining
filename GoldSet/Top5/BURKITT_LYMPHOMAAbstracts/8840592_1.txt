This study was carried out on 100 young patients with Burkitt's tumour from March 1994 to September 1995. They were clinically examined and biopsied at the Dental out patient Clinic, Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. The tumour was demonstrated as a single or multiple lesion involving the jawbones. It had a male/female ratio 2:1, the peak incidence had occurred at 4-6 years of age. The malaria, as an endemic disease in this country as well as malnutrition are factors which may induce viral factors involved in this formidable tumour.
