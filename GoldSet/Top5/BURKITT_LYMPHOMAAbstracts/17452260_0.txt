We report the chromosomal findings in a 4-year-old female with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The diagnostic karyotype showed an isochromosome 7q, i(7)(q10), as well as questionable rearrangements on 9p and 11q. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies on both interphase and metaphase cells using the MLL "break-apart" and the centromeric chromosome 4 probes were instrumental in the characterization of an MLL gene rearrangement, which was cryptic by conventional cytogenetic analysis. Specifically, the FISH pattern was consistent with an insertion of the 5' region of the MLL gene into chromosome 4 at band q21, most likely a variant t(4;11)(q21;q23). This is the second case of FISH detection of an ins(4;11) in ALL. Our case exemplifies the importance of FISH in the further characterization of precursor B-cell ALL cases without any apparent prognostically significant chromosomal abnormalities.
