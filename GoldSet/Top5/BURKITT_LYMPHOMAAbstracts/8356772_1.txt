Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGL) is a rare condition. A case story concerning a 17 year old boy is presented and discussed. The symptoms were fever and pain in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen, where a tender tumor was palpable. The tentative diagnosis was periappendicular abscess and the patient was treated with antibiotics. As the tumor persisted, a laparotomy with resection of the coecum was performed. Histologic diagnosis was malignant lymphoma originating in the appendix. There was no sign of dissemination in the abdomen. Postoperative treatment with chemotherapy and radiation was carried out. PGL in the appendix in young patients, almost entirely males, will as here often be of the Burkitt type. The histologic type of the tumor, the staging and the radicality at operation are important with regard to prognosis.
