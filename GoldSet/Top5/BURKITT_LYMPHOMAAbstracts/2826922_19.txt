A malignant neoplasm localized to the lung is reported in a rather unusual host: a 40-year-old female, nonsmoker, of South-East Asiatic origin. The histology was of nasopharyngeal-like carcinoma character and ultrastructural examination confirmed a diagnosis of nonkeratinizing, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The clinicopathologic findings were more suggestive of a primary pulmonary origin than the manifestation of an occult nasopharyngeal primary. The immunological profile was highly suggestive of an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated epithelial neoplasia. This case might widen the spectrum of EBV-associated neoplasia, by inclusion of lower respiratory tract as a target organ.
