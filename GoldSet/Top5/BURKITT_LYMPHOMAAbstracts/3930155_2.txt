We have shown using in situ hybridization that the constant region of the kappa light chain immunoglobulin gene (Ck) is translocated from chromosome 2 to chromosome 8 in Burkitt's lymphoma cells with a (2;8) translocation. The Ck gene then ends up adjacent to and on the 3' side of c-myc. The breakpoint probably falls between the gene for the variable region of the kappa light chain (Vk) and the Ck gene.
