Burkitt's lymphoma is quite rare outside of Africa. It is even more uncommon for this nonendemic form of the disease to present in the head and neck region. To our knowledge, nonendemic Burkitt's lymphoma has not been previously reported arising from the parapharyngeal space. We review the case of a 10-year-old boy who presented with an asymptomatic mass at the angle of the mandible several weeks after blunt trauma to that area. We discuss the evaluation of this mass, including the results of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, along with the findings of histopathologic and cytogenetic studies. We also discuss the differential diagnosis of parapharyngeal lesions, paying particular attention to the workup and management of Burkitt's lymphoma. Since Burkitt's lymphoma has the highest growth rate of any tumor in man, rapid diagnosis and immediate treatment are important and likely to improve outcome.
