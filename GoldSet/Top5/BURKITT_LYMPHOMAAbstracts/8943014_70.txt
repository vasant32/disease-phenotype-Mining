Human Burkitt lymphoma cell lines give rise to progressively growing subcutaneous tumors in athymic mice. These tumors are induced to regress by inoculation of Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized normal human lymphocytes. In the present study, analysis of profiles of murine cytokine/chemokine gene expression in Burkitt tumor tissues excised from the nude mice showed that expression of the murine alpha-chemokine interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) was higher in the regressing than in the progressive Burkitt tumors. We tested the effects of IP-10 on Burkitt tumor growth in nude mice. Inoculation of established Burkitt tumors either with crude preparations of murine IP-10 or with purified human IP-10 caused visible tumor necrosis in a proportion of the animals, although no complete tumor regressions were observed. Constitutive expression of murine IP-10 in Burkitt cells reduced their ability to grow as subcutaneous tumors, and caused visible tumor necrosis in a proportion of the animals. Histologically, IP-10-treated and IP-10-expressing Burkitt tumors had widespread evidence of tumor tissue necrosis and of capillary damage, including intimal thickening and vascular thrombosis. Thus, IP-10 is an antitumor agent that promotes damage in established tumor vasculature and causes tissue necrosis in human Burkitt lymphomas established subcutaneously in athymic mice.
