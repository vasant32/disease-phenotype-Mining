Nasal obstruction, mouth-breathing, snoring and deafness are common symptoms seen in children presenting to the otorhinolaryngology clinic. The aetiopathologies are frequently due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy and otitis media with effusion. Rarely however, nasal obstruction and snoring may be associated with more sinister pathology. We report a case of a child with nasopharyngeal B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma whose initial symptoms were of nasal obstruction and snoring.
