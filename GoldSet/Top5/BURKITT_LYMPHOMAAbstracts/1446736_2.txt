The effect of interferon-alpha on Daudi lymphoma cells either sensitive or resistant to the action of this cytokine has been analysed in terms of phospholipase C (PLC) and D (PLD) activities. Results have shown a combined modulation of PIP2-specific phospholipase C and phospholipase D. In particular, a decreased activity of PIP2-specific PLC has been found, concomitant to a PLD-mediated phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis, suggesting that the intracellular signalling activated by interferon in Daudi cells involves a phospholipase D/phosphohydrolase pathway.
