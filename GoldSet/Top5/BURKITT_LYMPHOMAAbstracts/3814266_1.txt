We report 21 cases of lymphomas associated with AIDS. Sixteen cases are Non Hodgkin's lymphomas of high grade malignancy. Immunoblastic B cell lymphomas are frequent: 11 cases/16, especially with extra nodal localisations. Three cases are Burkitt's lymphoma; 2 cases are large non cleaved cell lymphoma. Five cases of Hodgkin's disease are associated with AIDS related complex syndrome (ARC) showing the interest of lymph node biopsy in such patients. We analyzed 6 cases with lymphoid bone marrow infiltration and discuss the relationship between prelymphomatous states and low grade malignant lymphomas in AIDS or ARC patients.
