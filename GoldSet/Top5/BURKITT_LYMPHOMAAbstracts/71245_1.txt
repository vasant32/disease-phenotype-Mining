Lymphoblastoid cultures established from haematopoietic organs of baboons with lymphoma belong to the B-cell type. Cytoplasmic antigen is revealed in 2--6% of suspension culture cells established from lymphomatous baboons by indirect immunofluorescence reaction using serum from human Burkitt's lymphoma patients with antibody titer to capsid antigen of Epstein-Barr virus 1: 320. There is a correlation between the number of antigen-containing cells in these cultures and the number of cells in which herpes virus is revealed electron microscopically. Sera of baboons with lymphoma contain high titers of antibodies to Epstein-Barr (EBV) virus. Specific differences between antigens being produced in cultures by HBV (herpes virus of baboon) and EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) are minimal, that indicates their immunologic similarity.
