Seven Japanese patients with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), residing in Hokkaido, were studied during the period, 1979-1991. Immunological analyses of their lymphoma cells showed all to express surface and/or cytoplasmic immunoglobulins. Chromosomal analysis was performed in five cases. Four of the five lymphomas had the chromosomal translocation, t(8;14), and one had t(2;8). Three patients had extremely high IgG antibody titers to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral capsid antigen (VCA) and to EBV early antigens (EA). Two patients had positive antibodies to EA, and two others had normal antibody patterns comparable to those of EBV-seropositive age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Four of the seven lymphomas (57.1%) were positive for EBV-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA) by anticomplement immunofluorescence and/or EBV DNA using DNA-DNA reassociation kinetics, and/or Southern blot analysis. The frequency of EBV positivity in BL patients residing in Hokkaido was higher than that of cases previously reported in Japan. Three of the four EBV genome-positive BL patients responded well to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and/or surgical treatment, with no significant relapse being observed during the study period. In contrast, EBV genome-negative patients had poor prognoses despite having similar levels of clinical staging at the time of diagnosis.
