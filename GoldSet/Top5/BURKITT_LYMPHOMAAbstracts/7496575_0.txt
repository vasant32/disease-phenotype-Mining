A 77 year old man presented with a decreased vision, quite anterior segments, vitreous haze (++) (cells and flare) OD > OS, snow banks and snow balls at the inferior pars plana, suggesting an intermediate uveitis. Two subTenon injections of steroids were performed on the right eye, with improvement of his right visual acuity from 5 to 10/10. Cells and snow balls disappeared but the vitreous became more fluffy and more organized. Investigations did not demonstrate any systemic disease. The vitreous haze progressed bilaterally and failed to respond to systemic steroids. A year later, visual acuity was limited to hand movements (OD) and remained at 9/10 (OS). The vitreous haze + (OD) and ++ (OS) was extremely fluffy and moderately organized without inflammatory cells. Vitrectomy was performed in both eyes. Non inflammatory fibro-cellular membranes in a dense collagenous network with amorphous precipitates were observed in electron microscopy. One year later, he developed a systemic B-cell lymphoma. This unusual case illustrates the possible evolution of intermediate uveitis in a secondary PVR-like progressive non inflammatory vitreous haze with a particular increase of the amount of collagen fibrils and amorphous precipitates responsible for the fluffy aspect of the vitreous failing to respond to steroids.
