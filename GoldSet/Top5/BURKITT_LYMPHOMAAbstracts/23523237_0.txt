Acute kidney injury is a common manifestation of malignancies, either directly by the tumor or indirectly from anticancer therapy. The pathologic correlates of acute kidney injury in malignancies are many and can be diagnosed conclusively using kidney biopsy. We report a rare case of a patient with light chain proximal tubulopathy without crystals who presented with acute kidney injury. Kidney biopsy showed proximal tubulopathy without crystals with λ light chain restriction. Detailed investigations lead to a diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma with surface λ light chain restriction.
