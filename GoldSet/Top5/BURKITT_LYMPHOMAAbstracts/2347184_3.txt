Recently an increasing number of cases of malignant lymphoma with extranodal sites of involvement have been reported in homosexual and bisexual males as well as other patients suffering from AIDS. Many theories have been suggested as to the reasons for the development of these lymphomas in these patient populations. Here we present a case of a homosexual male who presented initially with constitutional symptoms, a rapidly deteriorating clinical state, and cardiac tamponade caused by American Burkitt's lymphoma infiltrating the pericardium and heart. Current literature and theories are discussed.
