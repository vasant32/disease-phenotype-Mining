Five monoclonal antibodies which are reactive to early antigens of Epstein-Barr virus have been produced by using somatic cell hybridization techniques. The specificity of the monoclonal antibodies to early antigens was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence, which showed that the antigens were localized to the nucleus of early antigen-induced Raji cells. Additional indirect immunofluorescence studies showed that like patient antisera to diffuse-staining early antigen, the monoclonal antibodies gave positive staining reactions after methanol fixation. One of the antibodies, 1150-4, was positive by the anti-complement immunofluorescence technique but differed with Epstein-Barr virus-associated nuclear antigen-positive patient sera in that it only stained induced cells. Different fixation methods were found to alter dramatically the appearance of the nuclear staining reactions produced by the monoclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot experiments revealed that monoclonal antibodies 1108-1 and 1129-1 recognized two polypeptides of 55,000 and 50,000 daltons (p55;50), 1173-6 and 1180-2 recognized just p50, and 1150-4 identified a 65,000-dalton nuclear protein. Immunobiochemical characterization of these viral antigens showed that p55 is a phosphoprotein, and p55;50 has strong DNA-binding activity preferentially to single-stranded DNA. Elucidation of the role of these nuclear proteins in Epstein-Barr virus infection and the events associated with Epstein-Barr virus-directed lymphocyte transformation may provide significant information on the pathogenicity of this important human virus.
