A 17-year-old white patient with Burkitt's lymphoma occurring during pregnancy is reported. Although it is primarily a disease of children, Burkitt's lymphoma occurs in women of childbearing age. In nonendemic areas (including the United States) this disease most frequently presents as abdominal or pelvic masses, and may appear initially to be a primary gynecologic problem. Bilateral massive breast enlargement due to tumor metastasis is always seen if the disease occurs during pregnancy. Although 5 previously reported pregnant patients and the present patient died, survival may be enhanced by prompt diagnosis and combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Obstetric and gynecologic aspects of Burkitt's lymphoma are discussed.
