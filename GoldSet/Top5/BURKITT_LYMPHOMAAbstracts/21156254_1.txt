Unclassifiable lymphoma with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma is a new category of B-cell lymphoma appearing in the new World Health Organization Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues. This lymphoma usually shows MYC rearrangements with non-IGH genes in the setting of a complex karyotype possibly involving BCL2 and, less frequently, BCL6 rearrangements. According to the presence of two or three rearrangements, these lymphomas are called double-hit lymphomas or triple-hit lymphomas (THL), respectively. Here we report two cases of THL with MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements and t(3;8)(q27;q24) diagnosed in one center in the last two years.
