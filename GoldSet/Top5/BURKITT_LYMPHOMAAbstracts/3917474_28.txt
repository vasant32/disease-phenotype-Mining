In this report, we show that resting human peripheral blood NK cells, positively enriched with antibody B73.1, can be induced to proliferate in vitro in short-term cultures, and newly express membrane activation antigens. B73.1+ NK cells, cultured for 6 days in the presence of conditioned medium containing IL 2 and irradiated B lymphoblastoid cells, show significant [3H]TdR incorporation beginning on day 4. At that time, a large proportion of the cells express HLA-DR and 4F2 antigens, and transferrin and IL 2 receptors, all detectable at high density by indirect immunofluorescence with the use of monoclonal antibodies. These cells maintain their ability to lyse target cells spontaneously or in the presence of antibodies. By two-color immunofluorescence and cell cycle analysis combined with indirect immunofluorescence, we demonstrate directly that the activation antigens are expressed on all NK (B73.1+) cells in the S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle, and on only a proportion of those in the G0/G1 phases.
