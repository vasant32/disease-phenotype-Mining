PURPOSE: To report a case of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) in an HIV-positive patient presenting as complete third nerve palsy. METHODS: Interventional case report. A 34-year-old man presented with headache, left eye pain, diplopia, and complete ptosis of several hours' duration. Left eye examination disclosed complete third nerve palsy with pupillary involvement. Significant hepatomegalia was noted at physical examination and computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed multiple solid lesions. RESULTS: Liver biopsy was consistent with Burkitt's lymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy was normal. Brain imaging was normal. Work-up also revealed positivity for human immunodeficiency virus. Chemotherapy treatment was started. Two months later, ocular motility examination was normal. CONCLUSIONS: Although BL affects the central nervous system very rarely, BL should be considered in any immunosuppressed patient presenting with diplopia or ophthalmoparesis.
