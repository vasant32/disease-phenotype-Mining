A fatal case of a Burkitt's lymphoma which occurred in a 34-year-old German woman during pregnancy is described. Nearly all organs showed either diffuse or nodular infiltration by tumor cells. Placenta and fetus were free of detectable tumor tissue. The patient had extremely high antibody titers (1 : 2056), both against Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen (VCA) and the early antigen complex (EA). Within the tumor cells the Epstein-Barr virus-specific nuclear antigen EBNA and viral DNA was detected. A cell line established from a tumor biopsy displayed a translocation involving chromosomes 2 and 8. The role of Epstein-Barr virus in the development of Burkitt's lymphoma is discussed.
