Peripheral neuropathy associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related Burkitt's lymphoma usually occurs as a toxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents. Whereas primary peripheral nerve involvement is an unusual complication, we report on a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patient with Burkitt's lymphoma and sciatic neuropathy due to compression by a lymphomatous mass. Therapy with radiation and chemotherapy was followed by clinical and radiological improvement, but recurrent neurological deficits in a similar distribution occurred later from lymphomatous meningitis.
