BACKGROUND: Previously, autologous Burkitt lymphoma-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) were found to express the gamma and delta T-cell receptor and recognize tumor idiotype in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) unrestricted fashion. METHODS: In this study, the authors established autologous CTL lines and clones specific for a B-cell follicular lymphoma. RESULTS: These CTL are tumor specific and inhibited by antiimmunoglobulin monoclonal antibodies, but unlike the Burkitt lymphoma-specific CTL, they are MHC restricted and express the alpha and beta T-cell receptor. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that different B-cell lymphomas can induce CTL of different phenotypes and MHC restriction.
