Two of 27 patients treated with intraventricular chemotherapy via an Ommaya reservoir developed unusual life-threatening complications attributable to the reservoir. In one patient treated for meningeal Burkitt's lymphoma, the cause of death was a large mass of tumor cells growing around the cannula. Also the tip of the cannula was found in the contralateral cerebral peduncle. In the other patient, the tip of the cannula apparently perforated the ventricular wall postoperatively and migrated into the contralateral thalamus. In both cases evidence for methotrexate-associated leukoencephalopathy was present at autopsy. Based on the experience with these two patients, we offer specific recommendations for reservoir insertion and use.
