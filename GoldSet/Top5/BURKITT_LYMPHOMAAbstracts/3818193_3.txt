Cancer is the second leading cause of death in children and, among cancers, lymphoma is the third most frequently diagnosed type. The majority of these are non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Although NHL have been grouped in a variety of confusing ways, recent research in cytogenetics and immunology, coupled with a better understanding of the normal pathways of lymphoid differentiation, has greatly lessened this confusion. Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is a type of B-cell NHL which is sub-classified as either endemic (African) or non-endemic (American). Kinetic studies have demonstrated a doubling time of only 24 h. As a result of this extremely rapid growth, symptomatic complaints occur early in the disease course. Structures contiguous to the primary become compressed and metabolic derangements occur. Signs of chronic debilitation such as cachexia, diarrhea, generalized lymphadenopathy, and weight loss usually are not found. Thirteen cases of American BL have been treated since 1980 at the Texas Children's Hospital and form the basis of this review. Ten patients had obstructive abdominal symptoms including constipation and pain, and 3 had masses in the neck, maxilla, or tonsil. Systemic manifestations included ascites, jaundice, fever, and hepatosplenomegaly. Two patients ultimately developed central facial nerve paralysis.
