The c-Myc oncoprotein is overexpressed in many tumors and is essential for maintaining the proliferation of transformed cells. To function as a transcription factor, c-Myc must dimerize with Max via the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper protein (bHLH-ZIP) domains in each protein. The small molecule 7-nitro-N-(2-phenylphenyl)-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-amine (10074-G5) binds to and distorts the bHLH-ZIP domain of c-Myc, thereby inhibiting c-Myc/Max heterodimer formation and inhibiting its transcriptional activity. We report in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo efficacy, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of 10074-G5 in human xenograft-bearing mice. In vitro, 10074-G5 inhibited the growth of Daudi Burkitt's lymphoma cells and disrupted c-Myc/Max dimerization. 10074-G5 had no effect on the growth of Daudi xenografts in C.B-17 SCID mice that were treated with 20 mg/kg 10074-G5 intravenously for 5 consecutive days. Inhibition of c-Myc/Max dimerization in Daudi xenografts was not seen 2 or 24 h after treatment. Concentrations of 10074-G5 in various matrices were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-UV, and metabolites of 10074-G5 were identified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The plasma half-life of 10074-G5 in mice treated with 20 mg/kg i.v. was 37 min, and peak plasma concentration was 58 Î¼M, which was 10-fold higher than peak tumor concentration. The lack of antitumor activity probably was caused by the rapid metabolism of 10074-G5 to inactive metabolites, resulting in tumor concentrations of 10074-G5 insufficient to inhibit c-Myc/Max dimerization. Our identification of 10074-G5 metabolites in mice will help design new, more metabolically stable small-molecule inhibitors of c-Myc.
