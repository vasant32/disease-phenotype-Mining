A number of human lymphoblastoid cells were examined concerning their ability to produce spontaneously liberated and virus-induced interferon (IFN). It was found that, in addition to B cells, various T and nonT-nonB lymphoblastoid cells responded well to Sendai virus infection to form IFN, the characterization of which has been recently reported (20). One B lymphoblastoid cell line from an infectious mononucleosis (IM) patient produced a large amount of IFN-alpha and might become an alternative source of IFN production. Among 68 cell lines examined, 35 cell lines liberated 10 U/ml or more of IFN spontaneously in culture fluid. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome or its activation appears to have no correlation with the spontaneous liberation of IFN. Spontaneously produced IFN from three cell lines was characterized as IFN-alpha. Comparatively higher amounts of IFN were produced in cells from IM patients than those from Burkitt's lymphoma cases or healthy adults. Spontaneously produced IFN was detected more easily in cells transformed by EBV alone than in those transformed by EBV and a tumor promoter, TPA.
