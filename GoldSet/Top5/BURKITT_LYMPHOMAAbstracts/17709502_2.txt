Interacting with T cells, cytokine-producing B cells play a critical protective role in autoimmune diseases. However, the interaction between malignant B and T cells remains to be fully elucidated. In a previous study, we have reported that ligation of CCL19-CCR7 and CXCL13-CXCR5 activates paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10), resulting in an enhancement of apoptotic resistance in B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) CD23+CD5+ B cells. Here, we report that B-ALL CD23+CD5+ B cells produce IL-10 at high level, which can be further elevated by costimulation with CCL19 and CXCL13. CCL19/CXCL13-activated B-ALL CD23+CD5+ B cells, in turn, increase IL-10 expression in syngeneic CD8+ T cells in a B cell-derived IL-10-dependent manner and requiring a cell-cell contact. IL-10 secreted from B-ALL CD23+CD5+ B cells in vitro impairs tumor-specific CTL responses of syngeneic CD8+ T cells. The impairment of cytotoxicity of syngeneic CD8+ T cells is escalated by means of CCL19/CXCL13-induced up-regulation of IL-10 from B-ALL CD23+CD5+ B cells. Moreover, using a short hairpin RNA to knockdown PEG10, we provide direct evidence that increased expression of PEG10 in B-ALL CD23+CD5+ B cells is involved in malignant B-T cell interaction, contributing to the up-regulation of IL-10 expression, as well as to the impairment of cytotoxicity of syngeneic CD8+ T cells. Thus, malignant B-ALL CD23+CD5+ B cells play an immunoregulatory role in controlling different inflammatory cytokine expressions. IL-10 may be one of the critical cellular factors conferring B-ALL CD23+CD5+ B cells to escape from host immune surveillance.
