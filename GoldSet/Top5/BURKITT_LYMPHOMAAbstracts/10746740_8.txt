Latent episomal genomes of Epstein-Barr virus, a human gammaherpesvirus, represent a suitable model system for studying replication and methylation of chromosomal DNA in mammals. We analyzed the methylation patterns of CpG dinucleotides in the latent origin of DNA replication of Epstein-Barr virus using automated fluorescent genomic sequencing of bisulfite-modified DNA samples. We observed that the minimal origin of DNA replication was unmethylated in 8 well-characterized human cell lines or clones carrying latent Epstein-Barr virus genomes as well as in a prototype virus producer marmoset cell line. This observation suggests that unmethylated DNA domains can function as initiation sites or zones of DNA replication in human cells. Furthermore, 5' from this unmethylated region we observed focal points of de novo DNA methylation in nonrandom positions in the majority of Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and clones studied while the corresponding CpG dinucleotides in viral genomes carried by lymphoblastoid cell lines and marmoset cells were completely unmethylated. Clustering of highly methylated CpG dinucleotides suggests that de novo methylation of unmethylated double-stranded episomal viral genomes starts at discrete founder sites in vivo. This is the first comparative high-resolution methylation analysis of a latent viral origin of DNA replication in human cells.
