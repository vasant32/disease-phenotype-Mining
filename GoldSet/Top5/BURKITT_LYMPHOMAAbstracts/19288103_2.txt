Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a rare subtype of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma, so studies on the outcome of adult BL, especially in Asian patients, are scarce. We report our results using the LMB protocol on Korean adult BL patients. Thirty-eight newly diagnosed BL patients were treated with the LMB protocol; 29 males and nine females with a median age of 47 years (range 18-70) were analyzed, and 14 (36.8%) patients had central nervous system or bone marrow involvement. After the induction phase, 28 patients achieved complete response (CR, 73.7%) and five showed partial response (PR, 13.2%). Among those achieving CR, only four showed relapse. All of the non-CR patients died, including five PR and one with progressive disease. The other four patients died because of infection after the first course of induction. The progression-free and overall estimated survival at 5 years was 74.99% and 68.10%, respectively. Of the 12 patients who died, the median survival was 4.43 months (95% confidence interval 1.43-7.43 months). Thus, most deaths occurred shortly after diagnosis, and four patients older than 58 years died after the first induction cycle. Most early deaths were caused by treatment-related morbidity and failure to achieve complete response. B symptoms, advanced age, bone marrow involvement, and St. Jude/Murphy stage IV classification were significantly associated with poor overall survival. In conclusion, the LMB protocol was effective for Korean adult BL patients. However, considering the high incidence of treatment-related deaths and the poor outcome of non-CR patients, risk-adapted modification of the induction phase is warranted.
