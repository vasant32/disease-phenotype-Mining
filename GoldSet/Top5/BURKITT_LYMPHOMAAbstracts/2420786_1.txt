Three monoclonal antibodies against human liver ferritin were selected to study antigenic determinants (epitopes) of human isoferritins. These monoclonal antibodies were found to form immunoprecipitin lines with ferritin in double diffusion tests (Ouchterlony), indicating multiple epitopes on a single ferritin molecule. The antibodies revealed high species specificity as well. Monoclonal antibodies MA301 and MA311 appeared to recognize different epitopes, since they did not inhibit each other in competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, MA309 recognized both epitopes for MA301 and MA311 with similar competitive inhibition. These epitopes were not detectable when ferritin was treated with 8M urea (pH 2.5) and were detectable upon reconstruction by dialysis against 2 M urea (pH 7.2), suggesting that these monoclonals recognize epitopes in the tertiary structure of the ferritin molecule. As a matter of fact, these monoclonals react preferentially with intact ferritin molecule and only negligibly with subunits. Isoelectric focusing patterns of human ferritins demonstrated that liver, spleen, placenta, and hepatoma cells (Li-7) transplanted in nude mice contained basic isoferritins, whereas HeLa cells (carcinoma), Wa cells (EB virus-transformed B cells), and Raji cells (Burkitt's lymphoma) contained acidic isoferritins. Human heart ferritin displayed a somewhat intermediate pattern between liver and HeLa ferritins. In spite of the heterogeneous population of human isoferritins, the dissociation constants (Kd) of the three monoclonal antibodies to liver, HeLa, and heart isoferritins were quite similar.
