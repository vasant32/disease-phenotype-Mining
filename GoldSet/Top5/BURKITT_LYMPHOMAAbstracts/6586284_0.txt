Translocations of chromosomes occurring in human cancer cells appear specific to the type of cell from which the cancer arises. To explain the action of these translocations, we propose dual position effect: Position effect of the cis type transforms the cell to malignancy, while position effect of the trans type permits the normal homologous chromosome to express a normal gene product. Thus, the translocation itself has to do with malignant transformation, while the normal homologous chromosome performs its normal function. This dual concept is illustrated by t(8;14) in Burkitt's lymphoma. The concept can be tested with t(2;18) and t(8;22) in lymphoid malignancies and with other translocations and chromosome rearrangements marking human cancer cells.
