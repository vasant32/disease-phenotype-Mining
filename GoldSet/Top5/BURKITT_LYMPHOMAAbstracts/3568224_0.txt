Primary lymphoma of the thyroid is a rare disease and it occurs in a low percentage of thyroid tumours. Nevertheless its frequency is increasing. We present two observed cases in this study. One of these is an exceptional extra-nodal localization of Burkitt's lymphoma. The role of surgery in these particular neoplasms and the importance of intraoperative histological examination for the rational therapeutic behaviour are stressed.
