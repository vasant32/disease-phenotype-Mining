Until recently, response assessment in patients with lymphoma was primarily performed by computed tomography (CT). Based on CT, International Workshop Criteria (IWC) were developed and widely used. Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) is a more sensitive and specific imaging technique for the detection of residual disease in lymphoma, and Revised Integrated International Workshop Criteria (IWC + PET) were recently proposed by the members of the International Harmonization Project (IHP), which combine both imaging techniques. We determined whether these new IWC + PET-criteria, can more accurately predict outcome compared to IWC-criteria in aggressive and indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and therefore correlated IWC and IWC + PET response with time-to-next-treatment (TNT) in 69 patients with NHL. We demonstrated that IWC + PET-guidelines are highly recommended over IWC-guidelines for patients with potentially-curable and routinely FDG-avid lymphoma. In contrast, no additional value of IWC + PET was demonstrated in a small group of patients with incurable histological subtypes.
