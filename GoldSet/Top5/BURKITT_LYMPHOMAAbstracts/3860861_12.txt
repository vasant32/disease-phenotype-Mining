Mex+ human lymphoma cell lines contain O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, a DNA repair enzyme that undergoes suicide inactivation on interaction with its substrate. The cells are therefore competent to remove the alkylation lesion O6-methylguanine from their DNA. However, several repair-deficient lymphoma cell lines (Mex-) are also known. It is shown here that Mex+ cells can be converted temporarily to a Mex- phenotype by growth in nontoxic concentrations of free O6-methylguanine. The depletion of methyltransferase activity is not a result of O6-methylguanine incorporation into DNA and subsequent demethylation by the enzyme. It is proposed that O6-methylguanine is mistakenly incorporated into tRNA molecules by means of a post-transcriptional ribosyl transfer reaction. The demethylation of such bases in tRNA has been demonstrated by using bacterial and human DNA repair enzymes. The existence of such a subversive repair of a methylated base in tRNA raises the possibility of competition between DNA and RNA for cellular DNA repair enzymes. Furthermore, it is proposed that the known aberrant methylation of tRNA in certain transformed cells, together with subversive tRNA repair, could account for the Mex- phenotype.
