A 20-base pair region in the first intron of the human c-myc gene was identified as the binding site of a nuclear protein. This binding site is mutated in five out of seven Burkitt lymphomas sequenced to date. To investigate the protein-recognition region in greater detail, the abnormal c-myc allele from a Burkitt lymphoma line (PA682) that carries a t(8;22) chromosomal translocation was used. A point mutation in the binding region of the PA682 c-myc DNA abolished binding of this nuclear protein. This protein may be an important factor for control of c-myc expression, and mutations in its recognition sequence may be associated with c-myc activation in many cases of Burkitt lymphoma.
