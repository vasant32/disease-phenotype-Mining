A 4-year-old boy was diagnosed as suffering from Burkitt's lymphoma with abdominal and maxillary involvement. The child was from a nonendemic area for Burkitt's lymphoma, and no association with Epstein-Barr virus was found. Two years after the completion of therapy, (3.25 years later) the child developed a solitary brain tumor, which was completely excised and was diagnosed as Burkitt's lymphoma. No meningeal involvement was found. Very late relapse in nonendemic Burkitt's lymphoma is very rare, and its presentation as a solid brain mass without meningeal involvement has not been reported before.
