X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) is triggered by Epstein-Barr virus. This virus is also associated with Burkitt lymphoma, a tumor that carries specific chromosome translocations. No such chromosome translocations have been observed in an analysis of XLP-derived cell lines. One XLP patient was found also to have Klinefelter syndrome, having inherited two copies of his maternal XLP-carrying X chromosome.
