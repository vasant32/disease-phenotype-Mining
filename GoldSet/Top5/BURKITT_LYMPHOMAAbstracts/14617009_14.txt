Aberrant promoter hypermethylation is a mechanism of tumour suppressor gene inactivation. We explored aberrant promoter hypermethylation of multiple genes in 88 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-non Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), 25 post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) and five common variable immunodeficiency (CVI)-related NHL. Twenty-six of 79 (32.9%) HIV-NHL, eight of 14 (57.1%) PTLD and two of five (40.0%) CVI-NHL showed aberrant hypermethylation of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Aberrant hypermethylation of death-associated protein-kinase (DAP-K) occurred in 70 of 84 (83.3%) HIV-NHL, 19 of 25 (72.0%) PTLD and three of five (60.0%) CVI-NHL. These data implicate MGMT and DAP-K hypermethylation in lymphomagenesis of immunodeficient hosts. In particular, promoter hypermethylation of DAP-K represents the most frequent molecular alteration yet identified in immunodeficiency-related lymphomas.
