Epidemiological data relating to all 202 patients diagnosed with Burkitt's Lymphoma (BL) in the West Nile District of Uganda in the period 1961 to 1975 have been reviewed and analysed. Statistically significant evidence of space-time clustering of cases, first reported for the period 1961-65, was also present during 1972-73, but not during other periods. The patients involved in such clusters were found to be older than other patients (P less than 0.001). The average annual incidence of BL in the District was 2.45 x 10(-5) and overall there was no change in the incidence during the study period. However, there were statistically significant changes in incidence in different counties, which could not be explained as case-ascertainment artifacts. One sib pair of patients with BL was found and the series also included 7 instances of BL in two cousins. It is suggested that study of variation in the intensity and type of malarial infestation in different areas at different times may help explain the epidemiological findings and suggest what, if any, aspects of this infection are critical for inducing BL.
