The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Akata, was treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 96 hr in order to reversibly arrest cell cycle progression in G1 phase. Stimulation of the cells with anti-IgG antibody induced a marked and synchronous replication of EBV DNA within 12 hr, before the cells entered into S-phase after release from DMSO-induced arrest. Furthermore, a reduced efficiency of productive replication was demonstrated if anti-IgG stimulation was delayed after release. The results indicate that entry into S-phase of host cells is not only unnecessary for, but also may have negative consequences for the productive phase of EBV infection. Also, it was shown that addition of acyclovir, an inhibitor of the EBV-encoded DNA polymerase, to anti-IgG-stimulated Akata cells inhibited the productive replication of EBV DNA, but had no effect on the expression of early genes of the virus, including BZLF1, BRLF1, BMRF1, and BHRF1.
