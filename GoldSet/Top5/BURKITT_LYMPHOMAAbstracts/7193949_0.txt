Pathological epidemiological and clinical aspects of Kaposi's Sarcoma are demonstrated. The prevalence of this disease in African countries and the appearance similar to the Burkitt-Lymphoma indicate a probability of viral origin. The histo-pathologic differential diagnosis also includes other vascular tumours. The disease shows a characteristic variable mixture of spindle cells and vascular components. In case of multifocal appearance surgery should be omitted, its aim can be only to ensure the diagnosis. A combined cytostatic and/or radiation therapy is recommended.
