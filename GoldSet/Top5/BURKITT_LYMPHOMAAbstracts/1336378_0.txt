The regulation of the latent promoter BC-R2 of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was examined using the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene reporter system. A 5' deletion analysis of BC-R2 promoter sequences has been used to characterize a region, described previously as a transcriptional enhancer in EBV positive cell lines, which can repress the BC-R2 transcriptional activity in EBV negative cell lines.
