A murine monoclonal antibody (MoAb 19-24) directed against a human sarcoma antigen was prepared and labeled with 111In by use of the linker 1-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (SCN-Bz-DTPA). Imaging and biodistribution of this radioimmunocomplex were evaluated. MoAb P3 was similarly labeled as a negative control. Of 24 athymic mice bearing s.c. human fibrosarcoma, 12 received 10 microCi of [111In]MoAb 19-24 and 12 received 10 microCi of [111In]MoAb P3. The mice were imaged at 24, 48, 68, or 168 hr, after i.p. injection. Region of interest and biodistribution analysis showed maximum localization of MoAb 19-24 in the tumor at 72 hr with maximum liver localization of 24 hr. Analysis of MoAb P3 showed maximum tumor and liver activity at 24 hr. Tumor specificity studies were also conducted in three nude mice bearing a sarcoma in the left flank and a Burkitt's lymphoma in the right flank. Selective uptake was seen in the sarcoma but not in the lymphoma. The excellent uptake of [111In]SCN-Bz-DTPA-MoAb 19-24 in sarcoma without appreciable liver activity indicates that it may be a useful tumor imaging agent in man.
