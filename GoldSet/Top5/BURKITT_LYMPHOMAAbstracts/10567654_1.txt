RBP, a transcriptional repressor, is intricately involved in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformation of human B cells. The EBV nuclear proteins EBNA-2, -3, -4 and -6 all utilize RBP to regulate the transcription of both cellular and viral genes. This study investigates the isoforms of the RBP protein in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells and in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed the presence of two different cellular isoforms of RBP; the molecular masses and isoelectric points of these two isoforms corresponded to RBP-Jkappa and RBP-2N. Fractionation studies and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged expression studies demonstrated that both RBP isoforms were located predominantly in the cell nucleus. Interestingly, GFP-tagged RBP-Jkappa showed diffuse, uniform nuclear staining, whereas GFP-tagged RBP-2N showed a discrete nuclear pattern, demonstrating differences between the two isoforms. Within the nuclear fraction of EBV-negative BL cells, RBP existed both in a free form and bound to chromatin, whereas in LCLs the intranuclear RBP was predominantly chromatin-bound. Expression of the EBV latent proteins was found to lead to the sequestering of RBP from the cytoplasm into the cell nucleus and to an increase in the chromatin-bound forms of RBP.
