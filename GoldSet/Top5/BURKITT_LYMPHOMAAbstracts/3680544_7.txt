The nuclear DNA content of 26 non-endemic Burkitt's lymphomas was studied by flow cytometry. Eighteen of the tumours showed a pattern characteristic for diploid chromosome distribution, while eight of the tumours were aneuploid. Six of the aneuploid tumours showed an almost diploid, aneuploid DNA index, while two were tetraploid tumours. Patients with aneuploid tumours had a significantly worse prognosis (p less than 0.005) than those with diploid tumours. One of the aneuploid tumours was positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA.
