We performed genomewide gene expression analysis of 35 samples representing 6 common histologic subtypes of canine lymphoma and bioinformatics analyses to define their molecular characteristics. Three major groups were defined on the basis of gene expression profiles: (1) low-grade T-cell lymphoma, composed entirely by T-zone lymphoma; (2) high-grade T-cell lymphoma, consisting of lymphoblastic T-cell lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified; and (3) B-cell lymphoma, consisting of marginal B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma. Interspecies comparative analyses of gene expression profiles also showed that marginal B-cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in dogs and humans might represent a continuum of disease with similar drivers. The classification of these diverse tumors into 3 subgroups was prognostically significant, as the groups were directly correlated with event-free survival. Finally, we developed a benchtop diagnostic test based on expression of 4 genes that can robustly classify canine lymphomas into one of these 3 subgroups, enabling a direct clinical application for our results.
