Antiserums to a purified cell membrane component from a Burkitt's lymphoma tissue culture cell line were produced in rabbits. These antiserums were cytotoxic to peripheral white blood cells from 8 of 15 patients with acute leukemia and 5 of 41 relatives, but not to peripheral white blood cells from leukemia patients in clinical remission or from normal individuals. These antiserums appear to be detecting an acute leukemia associated antigen or antigens.
