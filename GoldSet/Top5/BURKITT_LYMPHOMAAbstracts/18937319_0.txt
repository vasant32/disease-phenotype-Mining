The treatment of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) has come a long way in regards to survival, with the majority of even the advanced stage patients being cured. The prognosis for relapsed BL remains dismal, despite attempts to further intensify therapy. We report on a patient with advanced stage BL who relapsed in the CNS while on therapy. The patient was successfully treated with an intensified regimen based on a concentration times time (C x T) CNS-directed model. Our experience shows both the feasibility and efficacy of such an approach in a patient with an otherwise very poor prognosis.
