Tubacin is a small molecule inhibitor of histone deacetylase 6 and blocks aggresome activity. We found that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells were generally killed by lower doses of tubacin than EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) or EBV-negative BL cells. Tubacin induced apoptosis of LCLs, which was inhibited by pretreatment with a pancaspase inhibitor but not by butylated hydroxyanisole, which inhibits reactive oxygen species. In contrast, tubacin killed EBV-positive BL cells in a caspase-3-independent pathway that involved reactive oxygen species and was blocked by butylated hydroxyanisole. Previously, we showed that bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, induces apoptosis of EBV LCLs and that LCLs are killed by lower doses of bortezomib than EBV-positive BL cells. Here we found that the combination of bortezomib and tubacin acted in synergy to kill EBV-positive BL cells and LCLs. Tubacin or the combination of bortezomib and tubacin did not induce EBV lytic replication. These findings suggest that the combination of a proteasome inhibitor and an HDAC6 inhibitor may represent a useful strategy for the treatment of certain EBV-associated B cell lymphomas.
