Variant sublines of the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Namalwa, previously shown to differ in MHC class II antigen and immunoglobulin expression, have been tested with monoclonal antibodies defining B-cell specific clusters of differentiation (CD). The Namalwa sublines express antigens recognized by the CD antibodies in patterns that indicate that the cells are arrested at different stages of differentiation.
