PCR of clonally rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene sequences is increasingly used for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in lymphoid malignancies. Inherent quantitating problems are the main drawbacks of traditional PCR technologies. These limitations have been overcome by the recently developed real-time quantitative PCR (RQ PCR) technology. However, clinical application of the few published RQ PCR assays targeting immune gene rearrangements is hampered by the expensive and time-consuming need for individual hybridization probes for each patient. We have developed a new RQ PCR strategy targeting clonally rearranged IgH sequences that solves this problem. The method uses only two different JH hybridization probes and four downstream JH primers homologous to consensus germline JH gene segments. In combination with an allele-specific upstream (ASO) primer the consensus JH probes and primers allow quantitation of about 90% of possible IgH rearrangements. In a series of 22 B-lineage ALL the new assay allowed the detection of one to 10 blasts in a background of 10(5) normal cells. To prove the clinical utility we quantified MRD in 23 follow-up samples of six ALL patients with the new assay in comparison with a published RQ PCR technique that used individually designed primer/probe sets. We showed that the sensitivity of the new RQ PCR assay was slightly higher for four of the six cases and about 100-fold higher for one case, enabling detection of an increasing MRD level as an indicator of subsequent relapse 44 weeks earlier compared to the ASO probe assay in this particular patient. The results suggest, that the novel RQ PCR assay is a rapid, technically simple, reliable, and sensitive alternative to traditional quantification assays and simplifies current approaches of monitoring MRD in clinical trials.
