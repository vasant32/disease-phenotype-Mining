Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is rare, rapidly growing, and highly aggressive. Urgent commencement of chemotherapy is vital to prevent complications and promote a favourable prognosis. Any factor causing a delay in the initiation of chemotherapy will affect prognosis significantly. Intestinal perforation is a well-known complication with devastating consequences. It inevitably leads to a delay in the initiation of chemotherapy. There are few reports in the literature that discuss this complication. Furthermore, there are no reports of patients that have survived intestinal perforation occurring prior to the commencement of chemotherapy. We present a case of a 55-year-old male who survived perforation of advanced sporadic BL of the jejunum occurring prior to the commencement of chemotherapy. Critical aspects of the patients care are discussed.
