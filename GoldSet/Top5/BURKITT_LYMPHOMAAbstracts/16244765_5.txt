This paper presents an analysis of 24 cases in which recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) was used in the management of hemorrhage in patients with thrombocytopenia associated with hematologic malignancies. This is the largest case aggregation to date and focuses on preliminary experience in the off-label use of this hemostatic agent. Data were extracted from the international, Internet-based registry, www.haemostasis.com, accessed in September 2003. The search results were manually cross-checked against monthly summary reports. The physicians providing the cases were contacted individually to approve the use of their cases, supply any information missing from the database, and validate the data already held. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, B-cell or T-cell lymphoma, or aplastic anemia received rFVIIa at total doses of between 18 and 1040 mug/kg body weight. Bleeding stopped in 11 of 24 (46%) patients, markedly decreased in 8 of 24 (33%) patients, and decreased in 4 of 24 (17%) patients. In most patients, the response was achieved within 2.5 hours of administration of rFVIIa. The use of rFVIIa was generally well tolerated -- 1 case of ischemic stroke was considered to be possibly related to rFVIIa administration, but this has yet to be confirmed. A review of these 24 cases submitted to the www.haemostasis.com database suggests that rFVIIa is beneficial in the management of hemorrhage in patients with thrombocytopenia and hematologic malignancies. This warrants further investigation in rigorously controlled clinical trials.
