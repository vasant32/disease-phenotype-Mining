c-myc amplification is usually associated with lymphoid malignancies and Burkitt's lymphoma in particular. We present a case of AML with c-myc amplification which was associated with homogenous staining regions (hsr) and double minutes (dmin). The administration of GCSF following induction chemotherapy resulted in a marked increase in blast numbers. The GCSF was stopped and further courses of chemotherapy given, which resulted in complete remission. The patient relapsed 7 months after diagnosis and failed to go into a second remission with reinduction therapy. We conclude that c-myc amplification is a rare event in AML, but may be associated with chemotherapy resistance and a poor prognosis, are as dmins and hsr. Growth factors should be used with caution in these patients.
