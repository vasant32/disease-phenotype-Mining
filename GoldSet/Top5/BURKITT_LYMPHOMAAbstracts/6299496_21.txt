An account is given of the steps that led to the recognition of the tumor that became known as Burkitt's lymphoma. This is followed by a description of the methods employed in the subsequent epidemiologic studies, the manner in which successive hypotheses of etiology were erected and demolished, and the discovery by Epstein and his colleagues of the Epstein-Barr virus. The impact that this tumor has had on aspects of cancer research is considered.
