We present results concerning the reactivity of two moAbs (BR3, BR31) with human B cell lines and malignant B cells from patients. The first antibody BR3 shows a broad reactivity with B cell malignancies and B cell lines. It also weakly stains some non-T ALL cells and is negative on plasma cell tumors. The second moAb BR31 shows a restricted reactivity. It stains only HCL and PLL cells as well as Burkitt's lymphoma lines. Some moderate staining was also observed on 4 out of 12 cases of CLL and some non-Hodgkin lymphomas. PLL cells, cultured with polyclonal activators, lose BR31 Ag by day 4 of culture. These results suggest that BR3 Ag is present on the cell surface throughout B cell ontogeny while BR31 Ag expression is related to a particular stage of B cell maturation.
