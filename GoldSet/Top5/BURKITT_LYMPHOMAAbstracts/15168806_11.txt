 BACKGROUND: More than 80% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) occurring in transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. EBV viral load (EBV-VL) is predictive of NHL occurrence in this setting. The aim of this work was to determine EBV-VL in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), both according to disease activity and use of immunosuppressive therapy, including infliximab. METHODS: Between December 1999 and July 2001, EBV-VL was determined 212 times by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in 138 patients with CD and in 24 EBV-seropositive controls free of CD. RESULTS: EBV-VL did not differ significantly between the controls and the patients with CD and was not influenced by CD activity or by immunosuppressive therapy, including recent infliximab infusion. High EBV-VL values were observed in two patients with severe uncontrolled CD, but returned to normal once the flare-up had been controlled (by immunosuppressive drugs in one case and by surgery in the other case). CONCLUSIONS: EBV viral load is on the whole similar in patients with Crohn's disease and in EBV-seropositive controls. Infliximab infusion does not seem to increase significantly EBV-VL in the short-term. However, some patients with Crohn's disease have transient, very high EBV-VL values that are compatible with an increased risk of NHL in the transplant setting. The long-term clinical outcome of these patients must be determined.
