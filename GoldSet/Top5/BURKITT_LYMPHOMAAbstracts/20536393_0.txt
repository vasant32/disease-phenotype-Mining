We have shown that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic cycle activation in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells down-regulates chymotrypsin- and caspase-like activities of the proteasome. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether EBV activation might also affect proteasome subunit composition. Our results indicate that, independently of the latency program established in the host cells, induction of the EBV lytic cycle reduces the expression of the proteasomal components β5, β1 and β2i, whereas it increases that of β2, β1i, PA28α and PA28β. The modulation of the composition and enzymatic activities of the proteolytic complex are indicative of a less efficient generation of viral immunoepitopes.
