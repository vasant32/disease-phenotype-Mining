Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a hemolytic anemia due to anti-red cell autoantibodies that are reactive at cold temperatures. In the elderly, it may be associated with underlying B-cell lymphoma, usually a lympho-plasmacytic lymphoma variant. We report a case of CAD in an elderly Indonesian female, which was associated with a B-cell lymphoma that showed a histologic appearance consistent with large-cell lymphoma. Cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of trisomies 3 and 12, which have been reported previously in B-cell lymphoma associated with CAD. In addition, a t(8;22) was found in 24 out of 28 metaphases. Translocation (8;22) is associated with Burkitt lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic lymphoma, French-American-British subtype L3. It has not been previously reported in B-cell lymphoma asssociated with CAD, and could represent a blastic transformation of the underlying B-cell lymphoma.
