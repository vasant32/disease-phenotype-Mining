Sequence variations in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) gene have been described in many EBV-isolates. To characterize the genomic relationship between Japanese EBV and the EBV isolates of other countries, we analyzed the LMP1 nucleotide sequences in EBV positive cell lines and clinical specimens, including five African Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines, a Japanese BL cell line, a B-lymphoblastoid cell line, a nasopharyngeal carcinoma hybrid cell line, six gastric carcinoma tissues, two peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and a B95-8 cell line, which contained the prototype EBV genome. We determined the C-terminal nucleotide sequences of LMP1 by PCR-direct sequencing analysis and characterized the sequence variation of Japanese isolates, made a phylogenetic tree from the sequence patterns of LMP1 by a neighbor-joining method. The results indicate that the Japanese EBV isolates are greatly different from the African BL isolates but are closely related to the China 1, which is a strain of Chinese EBV isolates.
