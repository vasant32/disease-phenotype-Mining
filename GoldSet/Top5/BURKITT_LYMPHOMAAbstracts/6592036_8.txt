Eleven patients with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), i.e., small noncleaved non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 5 patients with Burkitt-type acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL-L3) were selected for chromosome study. Two of the 16 patients had no B-cell markers, but the erythrocyte marker--glycophorin A--was present on the surface of the leukemic blasts. The critical breakpoint at 8q24 was detected in 14 of the 16 patients, whereas this aberration was not detected in any of the 134 patients belonging to other subgroups of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or ALL that we studied during the same period. In addition to the t(8;14)(q24;q32), the following translocations with the breakpoint at 8q24 were seen: t(2;8)(p11;q24), t(8;11)(q24;q13) in BL, and t(2;8;14)(p11 or p12;q24;q32) in ALL. Additional aberrations seen more than once were trisomy #7 and abnormalities in chromosomes #1, #11, and #13.
