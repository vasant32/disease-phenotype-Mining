Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is a rare monoclonal proliferation of B-lymphocytes and is classified as a poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma. This tumor was first noted in Africans. The cause of this tumor is debatable, but strong evidence implicates Epstein-Barr virus in its development. This tumor predominantly affects children and is probably the fastest growing tumor in humans, with exuberant proliferation. It is a very rare malignancy accounting for only 0.76% of solid malignant tumors among Indian children. A case of BL of the mandible in a 9-year-old girl of Indian origin is reported.
