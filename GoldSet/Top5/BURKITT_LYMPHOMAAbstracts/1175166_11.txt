Specific biochemical molecules used as potential biologic markers, including modified nucleosides, polyamines, and pyrimidine catabolic end-products, were quantitatively measured in the urine of seven patients with Burkitt's lymphoma before, during, and after one or more courses of therapy. The results of this preliminary study demonstrated that patients with this disease frequently excrete significantly increased amounts oof modified nuceleosides (considered to be derived primarily from transfer ribonucleic acid), polyamines, and beta-aminoisobutyric acid during the course of their disease. With successful treatment and rapid destruction of tumor cells, a concomitant rise in these molecules occurs. Elevations were observed prior to chemotherapy and changes in levels associated with treatment or tumor progression appeared to correlate with disease status and to aid in assessing antitumor response. Periodic follow-up analysis of these molecules may be helfful in appraising relapse or recurrence of the malignancy prior to overt evidence of tumor by existing clincial means.
