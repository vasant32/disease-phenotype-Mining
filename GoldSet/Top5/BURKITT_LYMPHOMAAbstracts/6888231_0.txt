Buccofacial cancers are of Public Health concern in Africa. In order to set up an effective control of the disease, the only advisable strategy will be to focus all the Public Health programs on the prevention concept. For that purpose the author considers the following factors: --the early diagnosis by non-medical staff of carcinoma of mouth cavity and Burkitt's lymphoma. --the earlier management of the patients through an improved medical attendance. --the prevention of the recurrent cases by a regular monitoring of the treated patients.
