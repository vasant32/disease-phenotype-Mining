Lymphomas may occasionally present as acute surgical emergencies in children, most commonly because of obstruction, intussusception, or direct bowel invasion. We present the case of a 14-year-old adolescent boy who presented with septic shock and was found to have necrosis of the cecum because of a Burkitt lymphoma. The cause of the ischemia appeared to be mesenteric infiltration and subsequent vascular compromise of the bowel. We discuss the management of this patient and present a review of the literature.
