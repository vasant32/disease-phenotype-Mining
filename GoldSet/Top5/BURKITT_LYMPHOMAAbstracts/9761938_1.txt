In virus associated diseases identification of viruses in cells can contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis and may also help to establish the diagnosis. In the present communication, the effects of the microwave pretreatment (MWP) and that of the proteinase-K enzymatic predigestion (PKD) on EBER RNA oligonucleotide in situ hybridization (EBER-RNA-ISH) (EBER: Epstein-Barr-Encoded-(Early)-RNA) were studied. The efficacy of two EBV detecting methods, latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) immunohistochemistry and EBER-RNA-ISH were also compared. Our results show that microwave pretreatment enhances the intensity of the ISH signals and preserves significantly better the structure of the tissues compared with enzymatic predigestion. EBER-RNA-ISH, mainly in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma cases, showed a more frequent positivity than the immunohistochemical reaction for LMP-1, however in case of the Warthin's tumor only the LMP-1 protein was expressed.
