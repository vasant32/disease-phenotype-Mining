After treatment with Sendai virus, Namalwa cells form large amounts of interferon. RNA extracted from treated whole cells or from their polysomes was injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes and the interferon formed was titrated. The results show that the amount of interferon mRNA was maximal by 9 h after treatment of the cells with Sendai virus and then declined. Sucrose gradient centrifugation of the mRNA gave substantial purification and showed that its size was 12 S.
