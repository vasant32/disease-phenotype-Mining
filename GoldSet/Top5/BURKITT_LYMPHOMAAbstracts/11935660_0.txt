Burkitt's lymphoma is the most common malignant tumor encountered in children (age peak 3 to 8 years) living in areas with endemic malaria tropica. In the Hospital Central da Beira/Mozambique, two children with Burkitt's lymphoma were treated with cyclophosphamide. During the period covered by this report--August 1 to September 30, 2000--two of the required four treatment cycles were carried out, and both children experienced a remission.
