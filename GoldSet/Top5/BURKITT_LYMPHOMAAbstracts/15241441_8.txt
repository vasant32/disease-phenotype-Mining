Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) initially isolated from the cultured Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells, is one of the well-known oncogenic virus. The NAB-2 line, which was established from a North American Burkitt's tumor, was indicated to contain one copy of EBV DNA as the integrated form into chromosome 2p13 of the host genome. To demonstrate the integration site of EBV directly, and to clarify the relation between the integration sites and the oncogenes, fragments containing the nucleotide sequence of NAB-2 integration sites were cloned. EBV was integrated via the terminal repeats (TR), and integration sites located in the clone RP11-440P5 on chromosome 2, between two oncogenes, REL and BCL11A, which is apart from approximately 350 kbp from each other. Expression level of REL in NAB-2 was increased. The flanking region of chromosome 2 at the bilateral junction sites showed no homology to the junction sites of EBV. The integration site 2p13 overlaps with common fragile site, FRA2E. NAB-2 cells expressed almost all latent genes but LMP-2A that flanks the TR, indicating the type III of latent infection of EBV. Integration event in NAB-2 might alter the regulation of the oncogenes and provide advantage for continuous cell proliferation.
