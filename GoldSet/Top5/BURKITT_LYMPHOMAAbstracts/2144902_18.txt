The interferon system plays an important role in the control of viral infections and cell proliferation. These effects are mediated through the interaction of interferons with specific cell surface receptors. We report here the development of monoclonal antibodies against one of the subunits of the interferon alpha receptor. These antibodies detect a 110-kDa protein in surface-labeled cells and in Western blots, and 130- and 210-kDa bands after crosslinking to iodinated interferon alpha 2. No other subunits are disulfide-linked to the 130-kDa subunit or are coprecipitated by these antibodies. Analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the pI of this subunit is 3.5-5.0. We suggest that the protein recognized by these monoclonal antibodies be named the alpha subunit of the interferon alpha receptor.
