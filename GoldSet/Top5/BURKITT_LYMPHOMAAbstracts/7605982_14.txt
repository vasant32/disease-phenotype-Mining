Nearly all primary brain lymphomas in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients are associated withEpstein-Barr virus (EBV). The role of EBV in lymphomagenesis is not totally elucidated. One possible mechanism is the overexpression of the BCL-2 oncoprotein, because the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) has been reported to transactivate the bcl-2 gene in vitro. To study the interrelationship beetween LMP1 and BCL-2 in vivo, we have analyzed and compared their expression in 11 AIDS-related primary brain lymphomas and 57 AIDS-related systemic lymphomas by immunoperoxidase technique on frozen sections. In AIDS-related primary brain lymphoma, LMP1 and BCL-2 were expressed in all cases but 1. All positive cases exhibited morphologic immunoblastic features. In contrast, the only negative case was histologically close to Burkitt's lymphoma. In systemic lymphomas, LMP1 was expressed in 21 cases, whereas BCL-2 was positive in only 3 cases, all of which were extranodal. These results indicate that, in addition to the histologic type, the role of EBV genes and BCL-2 expression in lymphomatous cells differ as a function of their localization. In AIDS-related primary brain lymphomas, this correlation between LMP1 and BCL-2 overexpression may have a major implication in lymphomagenesis.
