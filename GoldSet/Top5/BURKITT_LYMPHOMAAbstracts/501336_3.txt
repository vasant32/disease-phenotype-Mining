The human lymphoblastoid cell line, Namalwa, can be cultured in serum-free media to cell densities of 3 to 4 x 10(6) cells per ml. These cultures produce up to 10 000 units of interferon per ml when induced with Newcastle disease virus, strain B1. Maximum accumulation of interferon was obtained at approx. 13 h post-induction.
