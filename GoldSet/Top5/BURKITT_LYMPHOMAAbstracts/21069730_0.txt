Burkitt lymphoma (BL) commonly exhibits Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positivity associated with latent chronic infection. Models of acute EBV infection have been associated with cellular resistance to apoptosis. However, the effect of latent long-term EBV infection on apoptosis induced by drugs is not well defined. To determine this, we have studied the response of the Akata EBV+ cell line (type I latency) to etoposide, before and after downregulating EBV gene expression. We observed that downregulating EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) expression with siRNAs reverted cellular sensitivity to etoposide. In accordance with this finding, Akata EBV+ cells showed increased sensitivity to etoposide, when compared to the Akata EBV- cells. We also observed that Akata EBV+ cells presented increased apoptosis levels and decreased Bcl-xL mRNA and protein levels, when compared to the Akata EBV- cells. In addition, Akata EBV+ cells contained less endoplasmic reticulum (ER) than EBV- cells. Finally, downregulation of EBV with EBNA-1 siRNAs caused an increase in the expression of Bcl-xL indicating that EBV is responsible for the differences found between the Akata EBV+ and EBV- cell lines.
