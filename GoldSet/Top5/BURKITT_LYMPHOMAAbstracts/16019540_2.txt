The occurrence of therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is rare and, to our knowledge, is not reported in patients treated for Burkitt's leukemia. We report on a child with ALL with translocation t(4;11)(q21;q23) involving the MLL gene, 13 months after chemotherapy for Burkitt's leukemia. This present observation indicates that caution should be exercised in using high cumulative doses of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors in such patients.
