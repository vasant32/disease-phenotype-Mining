Clinical animal models and in vitro data afford evidence for anti-leukaemia immunity. Many reports have underlined the interest of interleukin-7 (IL-7) use in cancer and its pivotal role in immune recognition. This cytokine, initially identified as a B cell growth factor, enhances the anti-tumour properties of immune effector cells via T lymphocyte activation, increased specific cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. Nonetheless, few data are available regarding the effect of IL-7 on the expression at the leukaemia cell surface of molecules involved in the immune response, which defective expression could induce tolerance or anergy. This prompted us to study the effects of IL-7 on 20 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 9 cases of lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), in comparison with gamma-interferon, a potent inducer of immune regulation molecule expression. In AML and ALL, IL-7 increased MHC class I molecule expression, while class II molecules were weakly modified. The expression of the tumour necrosis factor family members CD40 and Fas/CD95, together with the adhesion molecules ICAM-1/CD54 and CD58/LFA-3, was also increased in both types of leukaemia. The IL-7 was an efficient inducer of B7-2/CD86 expression in AML and ALL, while increased expression of B7-1/CD80 was only observed in AML. In the corresponding, co-cultured T lymphocyte population, IL-7 more particularly increased B7-1/CD80 and CD58/LFA-3 expression. Finally, pre-incubation of leukaemic cells with IL-7 increased the proliferation of responding, normal allogenic T lymphocytes and their secretion of gamma-IFN and IL-2 in mixed the lymphocyte-tumour reaction. We concluded that IL-7 is efficient at increasing the membrane expression of molecules which are central for the development of the immune response, and at improving allogenic immune recognition. The clinical implications of such data require further in vivo investigation.
