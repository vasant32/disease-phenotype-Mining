Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Southern, and slot blotting were used to detect Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA and RNA sequences in a Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell line derived from a North American patient (NAB-2). FISH analysis after hybridization with a BamHI "V" region of EBV showed that NAB-2 cells have EBV genome integrated at a single site on the short arm of chromosome 2(p13). Single hybridization signals were detected at homologous sites on both chromatoids and nuclei. Furthermore, hybridization of intact nuclei without formamide denaturation and heat allowed the detection of single specific viral RNA transcripts visible as "tracks" or "traces." Southern blot analysis confirmed the integration of EBV genome into the host DNA. Quantification of slot blot hybridization revealed that NAB-2 cells have on average one copy of EBV per cell. Virus insertion into chromosomal DNA caused a stable modification site expressed as a distinctive achromatic region adjacent to the band 2p13. The chromatid lesion at the site of EBV integration involving a recombinogenic and fragile site may have contributed to the development of the NAB-2 BL.
