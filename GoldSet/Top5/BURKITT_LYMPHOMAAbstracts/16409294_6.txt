CCL20 is expected to play a crucial role in the initiation of immune responses and tumour growth. However, expression of CCL20 in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated diseases has not been studied. We examined the contribution of EBV infection and EBV-encoded latent membrane protein (LMP)-1 to CCL20 expression. EBV infection and LMP-1 induced CCL20 mRNA expression in the EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cell lines and the embryonic kidney cell line. Histone deacetylase inhibitor-stimulated endogenous LMP-1 also induced CCL20 expression in an EBV-positive BL cell line. Analysis of the CCL20 promoter showed that it was activated by LMP-1 C-terminal activation region (CTAR)-1 and CTAR-2. Co-expression of IkappaB alpha, IkappaB beta, IkappaB kinase (IKK)alpha, IKKbeta, IKKgamma, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-inducing kinase and tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 dominant-negative constructs with LMP-1 inhibited the activation of the CCL20 promoter by LMP-1, suggesting that LMP-1 induces CCL20 via NF-kappaB signalling. The requirement for the NF-kappaB-binding site in the CCL20 promoter in LMP-1 responsiveness was established. Our results indicate that activation of the NF-kappaB pathway by LMP-1 is required for the activation of CCL20 expression.
