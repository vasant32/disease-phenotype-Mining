This study reports the first well-documented case of sporadic Burkitt lymphoma arising in and confined to the uterine corpus in a 40-year-old woman who presented with vaginal bleeding. Endometrial curettings showed a diffuse infiltrate of medium sized lymphocytes with the characteristic morphologic and immunophenotypic features of Burkitt lymphoma. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization demonstrated the t(8;14)(q24;q32) translocation. There was no evidence of extra-uterine disease and the patient is alive without disease 10 months after hysterectomy and chemotherapy. This report demonstrates that Burkitt lymphoma can present as isolated, organ confined disease at unusual sites and with protean symptoms.
