 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the application of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT) in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. METHODS: Between October 1995 and August 2001, fifty-one patients with hematologic malignancies (median age 34 years, range 5.5 approximately 52 years) received allo-PBSCT from HLA-identical (50) or 1-antigen mismatched sibling donors with conditioning regimens of TBI + CY or modified BU/CY2. Thirty-one patients were acute leukemia (AL) (15 in CR(1), 7 in CR(2) or greater, 10 in relapse including 2 relapse after allo-BMT and the other one never achieved remission); 12 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (CP 5, AP 2, BC 4 and relapse after allo-BMT 1); 7 MDS (RAEB 1, RAEB-T 1, AL secondary to MDS 5); Burkitt's lymphoma 1. A combination of cyclosporine and methotrexate was administered for GVHD prophylaxis. RESULT: All patients were engrafted. The median time (range) to neutrophil >/= 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelet >/= 20 x 10(9)/L was 14 (10 approximately 20) and 11 (7 approximately 45) days post-transplant, respectively. Grade II approximately IV acute GVHD occurred in 20/51 (39%) and grade III approximately IV aGVHD in 2 patients. Clinical chronic GVHD was diagnosed in 23 of 44 (52%) evaluable patients. Fourteen patients died: 8 died of transplant related complications, 6 of relapse. Thirty-seven patients are alive with a median follow-up of 399 (75 approximately 2 176) days, and among them 34 are in continuous complete remission, the other 3 relapsed. The 2-year probability of overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS) and relapse is 64%, 61% and 24%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic PBSCT is safe for both donors and recipients, and results in a rapid and stable engraftment without increase in incidence or severity of acute GVHD.
