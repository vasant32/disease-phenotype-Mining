Methacrylic acid (MAA) based polyelectrolytes were complexed with protonated or quaternized dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) containing polyelectrolytes to form microcapsules in vitro. Anchorage independent human Burkitt lymphoma (Raji) cells were successfully cultured in the presence of dissolved MAA containing polymer. Capsule morphology was investigated by light microscopy and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Capsules based on quaternized DMAEMA containing polymer were found to be more stable than capsules containing protonated DMAEMA functionality. Raji cells were successfully encapsulated in both systems and divided to confluence; thereafter sufficient pressure was exerted to burst open the capsules. Cells released from these capsules appeared to suffer no discernible trauma and were successfully isolated and subcultured to confluence.
