The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of bcl-2 siRNA on bcl-2 gene expression and apoptosis of lymphoma cell line CA46. A siRNA was designed and synthesized. Then siRNA was transfected into CA46 cells by cationic liposome. At 48 hours after transfection, apoptosis and mitochondria transmembrane potential of CA46 cells were detected by flow cytometry, the expression of bcl-2 mRNA and BCL-2 protein in CA46 cells were detected by RT-PCR and flow cytometry respectively. The results showed that at 48 hours after transfection, apoptosis of CA46 cells occurred, mitochondria transmembrane potential changed. The expression of bcl-2 mRNA and BCL-2 protein in CA46 cells decreased significantly. In conclusion, bcl-2 siRNA depresses the expression of bcl-2 gene in CA46 cells specifically, then changes the mitochondria transmembrane potential, resulting in apoptosis of CA46 cells.
