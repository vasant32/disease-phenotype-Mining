The authors present the historical evolution of the concepts of non-Hodgkin malignant lymphomas which lead to the new functional classifications of Lukes and of Kiel. These classifications are based on the discoveries of modern immunology and are relying on the marking techniques for the identification of the T, B and U lymphocytes. Arguments are presented why these modern nomenclatures should progressively replace the Rappaport classification which preceded the major developments of modern immunology. The Kiel nomenclature is briefly described.
