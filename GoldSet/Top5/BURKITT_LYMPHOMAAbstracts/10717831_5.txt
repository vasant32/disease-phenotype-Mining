The clinical presentation of Burkitt's lymphoma in the maxillofacial area is variable. The objective of this study is to review and analyse all cases of Burkitt's lymphoma with oral or maxillofacial involvement diagnosed in our department. A retrospective review of patients with Burkitt's lymphoma in the facial area between the years 1978 and 1997 was undertaken. The patients, 8 male and 5 female, were from 7 to 50 years old (mean 15.3 years). Six patients were Stage I and 7 were Stage II. Five had abdominal involvement and 2 lymph node involvement besides the maxillofacial presentation. Three tumours were in the mandible, 3 in both mandible and maxilla, 2 in the palate, and 5 in the maxilla alone. In 5 patients the tumour presented as a facial swelling, in 3 as an exophytic mass, in 2 as an ulcer, 1 case presented as a hyperplastic lesion, and 2 were periapical lesions. Complaints included pain (7), swelling (5), and sensory disturbance (2). EBV titres were positive in 4 patients. Abdominal involvement was only seen in patients under 12 years old. All patients were treated with chemotherapy, while adjuvant radiotherapy was indicated in 3 cases. Follow-up of 1-20 years revealed a 2-year survival rate of 61.5%. It seems that the Israeli disease is between that of the African and American types, when considering age distribution.
