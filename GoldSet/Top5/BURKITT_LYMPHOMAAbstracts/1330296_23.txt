To analyze the region upstream of c-myc, a number of novel probes were established. These were generated by chromosomal walking starting from the breakpoint of the chromosomal translocation of the B-cell line 380 and by cloning the breakpoint of the translocation of the Burkitt lymphoma cell line IARC/BL72. Using the newly isolated probes a detailed physical map of 500 kilobases of the region upstream of c-myc was established applying pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The chromosomal breakpoint of IARC/BL72 cells was mapped to a site 55 kilobases 5' of c-myc. A region 20 kilobases in length and containing the breakpoints of 380, EW36, P3HR-1, and Daudi cells was identified 170-190 kilobases upstream of c-myc. In addition the HPV18 integration site in HeLa cells was located between 340 and 500 kilobases 5' of c-myc. The probes were used to define the c-myc amplification units in Colo320-HSR and HL60 cells as well as in four cases of small cell lung cancer. Evidence is provided that the amplicon of HL60 cells is discontinuously organized.
