The case of a 33-year-old woman with Burkitt's lymphoma is presented. This is the third case that has been reported from India. The primary involvement was in the mandible. Endoxan was administered without response. Radiotherapy was resorted to as the second choice of treatment, but metastases developed rapidly in other organs. The patient survived for only 3 months after a diagnostic biopsy.
