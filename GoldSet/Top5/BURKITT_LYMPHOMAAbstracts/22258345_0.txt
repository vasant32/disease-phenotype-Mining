Although childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias are of good prognosis than leukemias of adulthood, some chromosomal abnormalities may have negative effects on their prognosis. Inverted duplication (1q) is a chromosomal abnormality with negative effect on outcome of Burkitt leukemia and lymphomas. We report a case of CD20 Burkitt leukemia with inverted duplication (1q) mutation, who had an early relapse during NHL-BFM 95 treatment. Two courses of ICE-rituximab treatment were administered after relapse and a successful HLA-full match bone marrow transplantation was carried out. He is in follow-up for 18 months without any problem after the bone marrow transplantation. We suggest the usage of ICE protocol combined with rituximab in childhood CD20 Burkitt leukemia with poor prognostic criteria such as inverted duplication (1q) mutation.
