In normal pregnant women, reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) frequently occurs. Cellular immune responses are apparently suppressed, but high titer EBV-specific antibodies of IgG class may compensate. The antibodies cross the placenta and protect the infant against primary infection for many months. Reactivation of EBV in pregnancy and oral excretion of virus by normal pregnant women could be one explanation why young children in large sibships (among families of low social classes) become infected early in life. Infants are likely infected by EBV from their pregnant mothers who shed virus in saliva. Moreover, the natural protection for several months in the perinatal period against Burkitt lymphoma and fatal EBV-induced lymphoproliferative diseases in congenitally immune deficient children is explained. The maturity and immunocompetence of the immune system at the time of primary infection by EBV and the size of the sibship seem to determine whether infectious mononucleosis occurs. Gammaglobulin derived from human cord blood may be a valuable source of viral-specific antibodies for serotherapy in immune deficient patients.
