 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinicopathology and immunophenotype of primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of the female genital system, and to analyze the prognosis of such tumors. METHODS: Clinicopathologic features of 43 cases of primary NHL of the female genital system were studied retrospectively, with the histological classification based on the Classification of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tumors (WHO, 2001). Immunochemistry technique, in-situ-hybridization and polymerase chain reaction methods were used to detect the immunophenotype, epstein barrvirus (EB) virus infection status and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement, respectively. RESULTS: (1) Primary lesions: there were 24 cases of lymphoma originating in the ovary, 3 cases in the endometrium, 10 cases in the cervix, 2 cases in the vagina and 4 cases in the vulva. (2) Staging: 12 cases (28%) were in stage I, 9 cases (21%) in stage II, and 22 cases (51%) in stage III. (3) Histological classification: 37 cases (86%) were diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 3 cases were Burkitt lymphoma and the remaining 3 cases were unspecified peripheral T-cell lymphoma according to biopsy, immunophenotype analysis, in-situ-hybridization technique and IgH gene rearrangement detection. (4) Prognosis analysis: increase in the level of lactic acid dehydrogenase, stage III, DLBCL and single operation suggest poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Establishment of the diagnosis of primary NHL of the female genital system is based on biopsy, immunophenotype analysis, in-situ-hybridization technique and IgH gene rearrangement detection, which play important roles in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the tumor. Combined therapy is the first choice of therapeutic regimens.
