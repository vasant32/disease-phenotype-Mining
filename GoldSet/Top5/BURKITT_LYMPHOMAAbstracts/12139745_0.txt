Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute leukaemia usually shows lymphoblastic morphology and a B-precursor phenotype. The bone marrow aspirate of a 9-year-old boy showed a L3 blast cell morphology in 90% of cells; immunophenotyping revealed a mature B-blast population. The translocation t(9;22) (q34;q11) was seen in 45 out of 50 metaphases, and expression of the corresponding bcr1/abl fusion transcripts, but no IgH/myc co-localization or splitting of c-myc, was demonstrated. Chemotherapy according to the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL-BFM 95) protocol with maintenance according to the BFM acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL-BFM 90) protocol resulted in continuing complete remission of 54 months. The occurrence of Ph+ Burkitt's leukaemia might reflect multiple-step cancer development.
