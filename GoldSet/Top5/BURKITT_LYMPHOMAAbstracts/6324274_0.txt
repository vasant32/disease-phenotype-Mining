A study was made of the effect of secondary radiation of 70 GeV protons on DNA of Chinese hamster cells. With a reference to fibroblast DNA, lymphoid cell DNA, and the lethal effect of radiation on the survival of Chinese hamster cells the RBE was 1.6-7.6, 1.1-3.8 and 1.14-1.7, respectively. DNA breaks were repaired to an equal level after exposure to secondary radiation from the accelerator and gamma-radiation from 60Co in equally effective doses.
