Burkitt's lymphoma cells exhibit the reciprocal balanced chromosomal translocation t(8:14) in 75% of patients. Cytogenetic analysis is time-consuming, requires in vitro culture with mitogens and enables to analyse a relatively small number of cells. We evaluated the role of multicolor fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in the rapid detection of t(8:14) in Burkitt's lymphoma cells. FISH detected the JH/myc translocation in 100% of the cells of five cell lines carrying the classical t(8:14) and in fresh cells obtained from a newly diagnosed Burkitt's lymphoma patient. In contrast, the translocation was not detected in the Bajb cell line that does not carry t(8:14). We conclude that FISH is a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool for the detection of the JH/myc translocation in Burkitt's lymphoma patients.
