The occurrence and incidence of a characteristic banding abnormality in a No. 14 chromosome has been studied in Burkitt-lymphoma-derived and certain other EB virus-associated lymphoblastoid cell lines. The abnormality was readily detected in 7 out of 7 Burkitt lines, and when present could be seen in 100% of cells with recognizable No. 14 chromosomes. In contrast, the abnormality was not observed in 775 cells from 31 infectious mononucleosis-derived lines nor in 450 cells from 18 lines obtained from cord blood lymphocytes experimentally transformed by EB virus in vitro. The significance of the abnormality as an indication of cells transformed by the virus in vivo is discussed, and the importance of this considered in relation to a possible oncogenic role for EB virus in man.
