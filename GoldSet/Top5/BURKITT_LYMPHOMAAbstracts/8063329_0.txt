Sixty-two adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were treated with a modified BFM regimen. Forty-two (70%) achieved complete remission (CR). Twenty-one percent of all evaluable patients and 32.4 percent of complete responders are in continuous complete remission (CCR) at a median follow-up of 41 months (range 24-81 months). Long-term survival was better in T- ALL (47.1%) when compared to precursor-B ALL (4.8%) (P < 0.04).
