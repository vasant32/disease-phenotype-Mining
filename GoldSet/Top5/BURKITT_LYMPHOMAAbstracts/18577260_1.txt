 INTRODUCTION: Burkitt's lymphoma is a form of non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma with more than one identifiable variant. The sporadic form most commonly presents with abdominal lymph node involvement. CASE REPORTS: We herein report on three patients from our experience that presented with either endobronchial or colonic Burkitt's lymphoma. Their clinical presentation mimicked that of other syndromes. After confirmatory pathological diagnosis, the patients had complete remission through the use of an optimal treatment protocol. CONCLUSION: Our review of the cases and comparable reports warrants careful workup of such presentations to ensure early diagnosis and therapeutic planning of this highly aggressive disease.
