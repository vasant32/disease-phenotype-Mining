The Pax5 gene encodes the B-cell-specific activator protein which is a key regulator in development and differentiation of B-cell. We studied the expression of Pax5 in hematologic malignancies to evaluate the diagnostic utility as a B cell marker. Materials included 70 B cell lymphomas, 26 T cell lymphomas, 53 acute leukemias, and 6 multiple myelomas (MMs). Representative areas from the paraffin embedded tissues were selected for tissue microarray, and the expressions of Pax5 was immunohistochemically evaluated. Pax5 was strongly expressed in most of the B cell lymphomas; 44 of 47 diffuse large B cell lymphomas (93.6%), 15 of 16 marginal zone B cell lymphomas (93.8%), all 3 mantle cell lymphomas, 2 follicular lymphomas, and 2 Burkitt's lymphomas (100%). However, Pax5 was expressed in only one of 26 T cell lymphomas. Among leukemias, it was expressed in 10 of the 14 B acute lymphocytic leukemias (ALLs) (72.4%), but also in 3 of the 6 T ALLs (50%), 13 of the 26 acute myelogenous leukemias (AMLs) (50%) and in all 3 ALL arising in chronic myelogenous leukemias and 4 mixed B ALL and AML. In MMs, Pax5 was negative in all cases. We concluded that Pax5 is very useful B cell marker in classification of lymphomas, but not of acute leukemias.
