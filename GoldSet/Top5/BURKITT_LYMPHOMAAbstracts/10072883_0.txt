OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between Burkitt's lymphoma and Epstein-Barr (EB) virus. METHOD: Two cases of primary nasopharyngeal Burkitt's lymphoma in children were studies. Clinical features include nasal obstruction and dyspnea. The histology of Burkitt's lymphoma was confirmed by use of immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and double labelling techniques, the immunophenotype and EB virus locating sites were investigated. RESULTS: The EB positive cells are B cells and represent 60%-95% of the tumor cells. CONCLUSION: Nasopharyngeal primary Burkitt's lymphoma is associated with EB virus in Chinese.
