Chromosome analysis was performed on cells from a patient of null cell lymphoma, well-differentiated type. A 14q12 translocation was observed in all the banded cells. In addition, there were multiple chromosome abnormalities. This case will be useful in considering the significance of the 14q1(1-3) translocation in malignant lymphoma disease.
