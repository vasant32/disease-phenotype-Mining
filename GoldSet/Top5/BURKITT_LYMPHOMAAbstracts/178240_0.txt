Three adolescent patients with multiple gastric target lesions and gastric lymphoma are reported. Each had either histiocytic or poorly differentiated lymphoma. The literature was reviewed to ascertain whether multiple gastric lymphomatous target lesions were confined to adolescent patients or to patients with a particular histologic subtype. Review of 119 cases in the literature did not support either hypothesis.
