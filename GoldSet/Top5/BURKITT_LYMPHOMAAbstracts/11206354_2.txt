Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are reported to have an increased risk of malignancy, especially lymphoproliferative disorders. We decribe the occurrence of ileocaecal intussusception secondary to Burkitt's lymphoma in a patient with SLE. A 23-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed with SLE 2 years ago, developed intermittent abdominal pain with a palpable mass. Computed tomography and a double-contrast barium enema showed a lobulated mass with intussusception at the ileocaecal junction. Right hemicolectomy and splenectomy was performed after histopathological examinations on colonoscopic biopsy revealed Burkitt's lymphoma. Fourteen months after chemotherapy, there is no evidence of recurrence of the Burkitt's lymphoma. When a patient with SLE has abdominal complaints, besides serositis, lupus enteritis such as peptic ulcer disease, mesenteric vasculitis with or without complications and pancreatitis, we have to consider intussusception secondary to gastrointestinal lymphoma as one of the differential diagnoses. Therefore, we should thoroughly investigate patients with SLE presenting with abdominal pain and not simply consider it afeature of lupus enteritis until other causes have been ruled out.
