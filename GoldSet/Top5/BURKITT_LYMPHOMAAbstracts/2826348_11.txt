A quantitative in vivo assay for evaluating the tumorigenicity of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines in nude mice is described. It is based on the dose-response kinetics of BL cell lines in pre-irradiated (480 rad) nude mice following the s.c. injection of 4 different cell doses. This model system was used to estimate the xenografting potential of 26 BL cell lines derived from BL patients of different geographic and ethnic origins, as well as lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) established by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immortalization of normal B lymphocytes. The results indicate that most BL cell lines are tumorigenic, but LCLs fail to produce progressively growing tumours in nude mice. However, BL cell lines revealed individual degrees of tumorigenicity and accordingly could be divided into 4 groups with high, moderate, low or no tumorigenicity. Preliminary attempts to correlate the xenografting phenotype of BL lines with other characteristics indicate that: (1) the aberrations of chromosome 1 are more often encountered in cell lines with high and moderate tumorigenicity; (2) EBV-positive BL lines do not reveal a higher tumorigenic phenotype in comparison with EBV-negative ones; (3) cell lines carrying translocations t(8;22) and t(2;8) might fall more frequently in the group of lines with high and moderate tumorigenicity; and (4) when LCLs grow in nu/nu mice, rejection always occurs and is associated with massive tumour necrosis. These findings suggest that the tumorigenicity of BL cell lines in immunosuppressed animals is not related with EBV, but with certain chromosomal abnormalities (BL-specific and non-specific) indicating that this in vivo model system can be instrumental for the identification of other factors or stages involved in BL development.
