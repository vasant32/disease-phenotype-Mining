Translocation (14;19)(q32;q13.1) is an acquired chromosomal rearrangement that has been associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell phenotype frequently progressing to lymphoma. Molecular analysis suggests that the translocation involves the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene on chromosome 14 and the BCL3 oncogene on chromosome 19. We present the first case of t(14;19) in a patient with acute leukemia. Correlation of detailed cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies, cell surface marker analysis, cytochemistry, and electron microscopy indicated that the leukemic cells were biophenotypic, with characteristics consistent with both myeloid and B-lineage lymphoid differentiation.
