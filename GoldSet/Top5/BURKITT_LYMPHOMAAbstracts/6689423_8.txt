Sixty-four patients with American Burkitt's lymphoma (AMBL) treated at the National Cancer Institute were reviewed to determine the frequency and characteristics of central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Patients with minimal or completely resected tumor never had CNS disease. Of the 45 patients with more extensive disease, 15 had CNS disease: nine presented with CNS disease, six of whom subsequently had recurrent CNS disease, and six developed CNS disease only at relapse. There was a significant association between CNS and bone-marrow disease at presentation. Therapy of CNS disease consisted of short courses of intrathecal chemotherapy with cytosine arabinoside and methotrexate. Cranial irradiation was given only to patients with CNS relapse. There are six long-term survivors (LTS) who have been disease free for four to six years post chemotherapy. Of these six LTS, three presented with CNS disease, two experienced isolated CNS relapse, and one had CNS disease both at presentation and at relapse. Three of the six LTS never received cranial irradiation. It is concluded that CNS involvement in AMBL can be effectively treated, and that long-term remission, which is probably cure, can be achieved.
