L-carnitine (beta-hydroxy-trimethylaminobutyric acid) plays an essential metabolic role that consists of transferring the long chain fatty acids through the mitochondrial barrier, thus allowing their energy-yielding oxidation. GP7 (4-[4''-(2'', 2'', 6'', 6''-tetramethyl-l''-piperidinyloxy) amino] -4'-demethyl-epipodophyllotoxin) is a new spin-labeled derivative of podophyllotoxin semi-synthesized by our university. In this study, we examined the activity of L-carnitine in GP7-induced apoptosis in Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Raji. GP7 induced time- and dose-dependent apoptotic DNA fragmentation accompanied by caspase-3 activation in Raji cells, and the kinetics of caspase-3 activation induced by GP7 was well correlated with that of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. L-carnitine treatment prevented GP7-induced caspase-3 activation, suppressed caspase-3 cleavage and abrogated GP7-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation in Raji cells. Our findings suggest that L-carnitine is a potent anti-apoptotic agent to human lymphoma cells and may exert its anti-apoptotic effect via inhibition of caspase-3 activity in GP7-treated Raji cells.
