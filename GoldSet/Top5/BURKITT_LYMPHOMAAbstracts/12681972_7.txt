 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Short, intensive multiagent chemotherapy has resulted in significant progress in Burkitt's lymphoma and leukemia. A protocol was designed to treat all adult patients with mature B-cell lymphoma or leukemia with the aims of comparing the response to therapy and survival with regards to their HIV infection status. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-three adult patients with advanced stage Burkitt's lymphoma or Burkitt's leukemia were treated. Response to therapy, survival and toxicity were evaluated according to their HIV infection status. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 53 years (range 15-74). There were no differences in CR rates between HIV-negative (77%) and HIV-positive patients (71%). Only age > 60 years was associated with a lower CR rate (OR 0.18, 95%CI 0.04-0.81, p=0.026). The 2-year overall survival (OS) probability was 51% (95%CI, 38%-64%) for the 53 patients. The OS of HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients did not significantly differ. Only age > 60 years was associated with a shorter OS (OR 5.1, 95%CI 2.0-12.7, p=0.001). The 2-year disease free survival (DFS) for the 40 patients achieving CR was 60% (95%CI, 45%-75%). Age > 60 years was the only identified factor associated with a shorter DFS (OR 5.2, 95%CI 1.4-20, p=0.015). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the effectiveness of intensive strategies in adult patients with advanced stage Burkitt's lymphoma or leukemia. It also shows the feasibility of these strategies in individuals with HIV infection with comparable results. Advanced age proved to be the main adverse prognostic factor for response to therapy and survival.
