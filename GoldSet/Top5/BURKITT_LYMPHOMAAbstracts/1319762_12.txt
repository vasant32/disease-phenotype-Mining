In this study we have characterized the cell surface interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor in HepG2 hepatoma cells. We found that HepG2 cells bind both IL-1 alpha and beta with high affinity, KDs of 136 and 180 pM and receptor densities of 16,000 and 8500 binding sites/cell respectively. The binding sites appeared to be predominantly type II since phorbol ester treatment of the cells, which selectively downregulates type II IL-1 receptors, reduced binding by 68% while treatment of the cells with an inhibitory monoclonal antibody specific for the type I receptor had no significant effect on IL-1 binding. Competition studies with a modified IL-1 beta analog (Glu4) also revealed binding kinetics more consistent with binding to type II receptors than to type I. Crosslinking and ligand blotting with human 125I-IL-1 demonstrated the presence of two bands, a 78 kDa band typical of crosslinking to type II (p60) receptor, and a 98 kDa band, typical of crosslinking to the type I (p80) receptor. Low level expression of the type I receptor was consistent with molecular biological studies employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification which indicated that mRNA for the type I receptor was produced by the HepG2 cells. Functional receptors were demonstrated by the induction of IL-8 by IL-1 stimulated cells.
