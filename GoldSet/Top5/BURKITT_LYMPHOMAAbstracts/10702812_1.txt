BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We have previously reported on a complex chromosome rearrangement [der(17)] in a B-cell line, BRG A, established from an AIDS patient with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). The aim of the present study was the definition of der(17) composition and the identification of complete or partial chromosome gains and losses in two cell clones (BRG A and BRG M) derived from this patient. DESIGN AND METHODS: We applied comparative genome hybridization (CGH) to detect the DNA misrepresentations in the genome of the two cell clones. Findings from CGH and banding analysis could then direct the choice of probes for chromosome painting experiments to elucidate der(17) composition. RESULTS: CGH analysis identified gains of chromosomes 1q, 7q, 12q, 13q, 15q, 17p, 20p,q and losses of chromosomes 3p and 5q in BRG A and gain of chromosome 1q and loss in chromosome 6q in BRG M. Some of the detected alterations had already been described in lymphomas, while others appeared to be new. The combination of these techniques allowed a precise definition of der(17), composed by translocated regions from chromosomes 12 and 15. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated CGH to be a powerful tool in the identification of recurrent chromosome aberrations in an AIDS-related BL and in ascertaining the origin of marker chromosomes. We were also able to identify a different pattern of aberrations and assess an independent sequence of events leading to the 1p gain in the two subclones.
