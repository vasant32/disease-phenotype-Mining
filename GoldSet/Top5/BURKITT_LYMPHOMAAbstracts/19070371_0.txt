 AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the relative frequency of orofacial tumors and tumor like lesions in Libyan children and adolescents, and compare our findings with reports in the literature. METHODS: A total of 213 cases of tumors and tumor like lesions were seen in patients aged 18 years and less during a period of 17 years. RESULTS: There were 8 cases (3.7%) of malignant tumors in our study, 35 cases (16.4%) of benign odontogenic tumors and 170 cases (89%) of benign tumors and tumor like lesions of orofacial region were seen in this study. orofacial tumors are not uncommon among the Libyan children and adolescents. CONCLUSION: A slightly lower incidence of malignant tumors was observed as a result of the less number of cases of Burkitt's lymphoma, in comparison to other reports from Africa.
