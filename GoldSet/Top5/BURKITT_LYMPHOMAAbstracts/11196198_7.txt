A partial nontandem duplication (PNTD) of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene is described in B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia without structural cytogenetic abnormalities at 11q23 and 9p22. A duplicated portion of MLL is interrupted by the insertion of a region of 9p22 that includes the 3'-end of the AF9 gene. The PNTD encodes: (a) a PNTD transcript; (b) a partial tandem duplication of MLL; and (c) a chimeric transcript fusing MLL to the 3'-end of AF9, mimicking the t(9;11)(p22;q23) and expressed 1024-fold higher than the other two. The MLL PNTD, therefore, contributes toward leukemogenesis through simultaneous production of fusion transcripts that are otherwise encoded by three distinct genetic defects.
