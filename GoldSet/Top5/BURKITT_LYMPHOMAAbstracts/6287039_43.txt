The majority of hybridomas we have characterized against Epstein-Barr virions react with the major glycoproteins gp350 and gp220 (gp350/220). One of these antibodies, ID4C-1, neutralizes virus infection in vitro. The presence of gp350/220 on the viral envelope could be confirmed directly by immunoelectron microscopy. We used lectin affinity (ricin) and immunoaffinity (ID4C-1) to purify gp350/220 and show that this material is able to induce potent virus-neutralizing antibodies. Absorption of four human and one rabbit anti-Epstein-Barr virus sera with purified gp350/220 suggests that this is the primary component responsible for generating neutralizing antibodies in vivo.
