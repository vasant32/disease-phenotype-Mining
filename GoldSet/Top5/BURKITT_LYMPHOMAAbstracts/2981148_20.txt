The Cancer Family Syndrome of Lynch (CFS) is characterized by the frequent occurrence of multiple types of cancers, often adenocarcinomas of the colon, endometrium, and breast, at early ages in a pedigree pattern suggesting an autosomal dominant mechanism of inheritance. An unusual CFS pedigree is presented in which members exhibited rare cancers, six primary cancers, and prolonged survival.
