The ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 protein can determine whether cells will die via apoptosis or be protected from it. Reh was found to express a high basal level of Bcl-2 but was lacking of Bax protein expression. Treatment with bryostatin 1 induced a down-regulation in Bcl-2 protein that was not accompanied by an obvious Bax protein induction or apoptosis. These results suggest that a decreased level of Bcl-2 alone in this cell line is not sufficient for apoptosis induction. In an effort to identify the mechanism whereby apoptosis could be induced in this ALL model, we treated Reh cells with three microtubule inhibitors: dolastatin 10, auristatin PE and vincristine, in the presence and absence of bryostatin 1. When used alone, only dolastatin 10 induced apoptosis that was detected morphologically, and by flow cytometry. Western blots revealed that dolastatin 10-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the induction of Bax protein and the reduction in Bcl-2 protein. Auristatin PE and vincristine induced both Bax and Bcl-2 protein, leaving the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio constant. Reh cells pretreated for 24 h with bryostatin 1 followed by dolastatin 10, auristatin PE or vincristine showed significant apoptosis which was accompanied by Bcl-2 protein down regulation and Bax protein up regulation. We conclude that: (1) expression of bax is necessary for apoptosis-induction in this model; (2) a decrease in Bcl-2 level alone is not sufficient and might not be necessary for apoptosis-induction; and (3) the ratio of Bax:Bcl-2 plays a critical role in susceptibility to apoptosis in Reh cells. The results from this study should prove useful in guiding the clinical application of these novel agents in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
