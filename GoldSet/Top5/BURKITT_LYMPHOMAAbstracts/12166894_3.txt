In Taiwan, primary intestinal lymphomas (PIL) have rarely been reported and characterized. Using WHO classification, we retrospectively studied the clinicopathological features of PIL cases surgically resected in Taiwan. There were 21 cases, 14 males and seven females, with a median age of 66. The most common symptom at presentation was abdominal pain (n = 14; 66.7%). Six (28.6%) cases showed perforation and two (9.5%) intussusception. Two patients had multicentric tumors. The most common location was ileum (n = 11, 52.4%). Twenty cases (95.2%) were of B-cell lineage, and one (4.8%) was of T-cell lineage. These cases were classified as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBL) (n = 18; 85.7%), Burkitt lymphoma (n = 2; 9.5%), and enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma (EATL) (n = 1; 4.8%). One case was lost to follow-up. The 1- and 2-yr survival rates of the remaining 20 patients were 44.4% and 26.7%, respectively. In conclusion, we describe the clinicopathological findings of a rare case of appendiceal DLBL and another one of ileal EATL, that have never been reported in Taiwan previously. We found that in Taiwan PIL occurred in the elderly, with a male predominance, showing a relatively aggressive clinical course, and a pattern similar to that seen in western countries, except for the absence of multiple lymphomatous polyposis.
