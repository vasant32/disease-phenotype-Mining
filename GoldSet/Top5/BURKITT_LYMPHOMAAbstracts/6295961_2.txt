To describe structures and biological functions of targets for antibody-mediated immune responses to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected lymphoid cells, we have characterized a membrane-associated protein of 105,000 daltons, p105, which was prominently recognized in immunoprecipitates with some EBV antigen-reactive patients' sera. A rabbit antiserum to immunopurified p105 was developed. [35S]methionine-labeled p105 was specific to EBV-superinfected Raji cells, and its synthesis was not blocked with phosphonoacetic acid, indicating that it is an "early" viral antigen. Phosphonoacetic acid treatment of EBV-superinfected Raji cells was associated with the accumulation, mainly in the cytosol, of an 88,000-dalton protein, p88, which was also recognized with anti-p105 serum, but was not detected in superinfected cells which had not been treated with phosphonoacetic acid. Although anti-p105 serum immunoprecipitated a membrane fraction protein, it did not neutralize P3HR-1 virus and was not considered to be an exposed virion component. We conclude that p105 is an early, EBV-induced, membrane fraction antigen to which EBV-infected patients generate a substantial antibody response.
