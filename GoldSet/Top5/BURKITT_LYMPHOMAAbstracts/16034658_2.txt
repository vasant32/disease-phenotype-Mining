 PURPOSE: This article describes and discusses primary Burkitt's lymphoma of the anus which is an extremely rare site of origin. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 38-year-old HIV+ Rwandan farmer had an 8-cm x 13-cm anal tumor. Histopathology and immunohistology provided evidence of an Epstein-Barr virus-associated Burkitt's lymphoma. Chemotherapy in combination of virostatic therapy is the gold standard for treatment, but because of economic constraints surgical treatment was the only practicable intervention and an abdominoperineal resection of the anorectum was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the AIDS epidemic and the increase of anal malignant pathologies, anal Burkitt's lymphoma may appear more frequently. Adequate treatment is available for only a small percentage of patients.
