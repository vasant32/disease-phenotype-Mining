A murine plasmacytoma (MPC) with a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 15 and 16 with breakpoints in 15D2/3 and 16B1 is reported. The breakpoint on chromosome 15 is identical to the breakpoint in the MPC-associated typical (12;15) and kappa variant (6;15) translocation. Therefore it probably involves the c-myc gene as well. Unlike the Burkitt lymphoma (BL) system, a lambda/myc variant translocation has not been described in the MPC system. Chromosome 16 is known to carry the lambda gene. Therefore, the 15;16 translocation probably represents the "missing" lambda/myc variant in MPC, suggesting that the lambda gene is localized at 16B1.
