IL-4 induces germ-line epsilon transcript synthesis in normal human B cells, but a second signal provided by CD4+ T cells is required for subsequent production of productive epsilon mRNA and IgE synthesis. In the present study we demonstrate that IL-4 specifically induces germ-line epsilon transcripts in most EBV lymphoblastoid (LCL) and EBV+ and EBV- Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells without inducing IgE synthesis. However, cocultivation of cloned sIgM+, sIgE- EBV-LCL or BL cells with activated CD4+ T cell clones in the presence of IL-4 resulted in IgE production in 13 to 24% of the wells. Analysis of rearranged DNA in IgE-producing cloned BL cells indicated that epsilon switching occurred through a recombination deletion event. IgE production is a stable feature of the cloned switched EBV-LCL and BL cells because these cells continued to produce relatively high levels of IgE in the absence of IL-4 and CD4+ T cells. Induction of IgE synthesis was blocked by IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), but only TGF-beta inhibited IL-4-induced germ-line epsilon mRNA expression. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of TGF-beta are mediated via inhibition of germ-line epsilon expression, whereas IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma block other steps in the regulatory processes resulting in induction of IgE synthesis by established human B cell line cells. Our results indicate that the same set of signals that induce normal B cells to switch to IgE synthesis also induce high frequency epsilon switching in cloned established EBV transformed and malignant B cell lines including classical cell lines such as JY and BL-2.
