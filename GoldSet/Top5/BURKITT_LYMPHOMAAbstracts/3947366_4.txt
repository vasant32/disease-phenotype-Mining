A 48-kDa protein (p48) crossreactive with an antiserum directed against the 12 C-terminal amino acids of the human cellular myc gene-encoded protein was isolated from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line. The p48 protein is a basic protein and has a cytoplasmic localization. An antiserum prepared against purified p48 reacts specifically with a 48-kDa protein present in a variety of mouse and human cells. This polypeptide is detected at very low levels in normal, resting, peripheral blood lymphocytes, but is induced several-fold by stimulation with either concanavalin A or pokeweed mitogen. The association of p48 induction with a proliferative response and the crossreactivity with the cellular myc protein are discussed.
