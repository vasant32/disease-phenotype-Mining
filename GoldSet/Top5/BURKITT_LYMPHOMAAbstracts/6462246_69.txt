E26 is an acute leukaemia avian retrovirus which induces myeloblastosis and erythroblastosis in vivo and transforms erythroblasts and myeloblasts in vitro. It contains the oncogene v-myb (ref. 4), first described for avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV), as well as a second specific nucleotide sequence, v-ets located 3' to v-myb (refs 5,6). We have reported that v-ets has a cellular counterpart (c-ets) in chicken and human DNA. Now, using two independent methods--hybridization with human c-ets probe of sorted chromosomes and in situ hybridization--we report the localization of the ets locus on human chromosome 11 at bands q23-q24. This finding may be important, as specific breakpoints around this position have been reported for human malignancies such as acute monocytic leukaemia and Ewing's sarcoma.
