Primary clinical presentation of malignant lymphoma in the middle ear is rare. One case of African Burkitt's lymphoma involving the mastoid has been reported, but the case herein presented would appear to be the first case of American Burkitt's lymphoma in the literature. American and African varieties have distinct clinical presentations but are histologically identical. Chemotherapy is effective against these aggressive tumors. A 6-year-old boy with the first known case of American Burkitt's lymphoma of the mastoid is presented. He is doing well 23 months from the onset of symptoms.
