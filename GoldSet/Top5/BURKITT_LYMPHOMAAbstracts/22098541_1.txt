Specific trials on adult Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and 'unclassifiable' lymphomas with features intermediate between BL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (BL/DLBCL) are advocated which include substantial numbers of older patients, to improve treatment feasibility, while countering risks of systemic and central nervous system (CNS) recurrences. We prospectively evaluated a modified CODOX-M/IVAC (CODOX-M: cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, high-dose methotrexate; IVAC: ifosfamide, etoposide and high-dose cytarabine) regimen by the addition of rituximab (R) and liposome-encapsulated cytarabine (D) to increase antitumour activity and halve the number of intrathecal treatments. Thirty adults (40% >60years) with BL (n=15) and BL/DLBCL (n=15) were accrued. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), CNS recurrence, and liposomal cytarabine-associated toxicity. Eighty percent of patients received the whole treatment programme, the remaining cases received at least three full courses. Application of the RD-CODOX-M/IVAC regimen resulted in remarkable 4-year PFS (78%) and complete remission (CR) rates (93%). However, PFS was significantly lower in patients older than 60years as compared to younger ones (49%vs 93%, P=0·03; median, 36months), despite high actual dose-intensity, CR rate and tolerability. Reduced-intensity intratechal prophylaxis through liposomal cytarabine was effective because the CNS failure rate was low (3·4%) and without severe neurological toxicities. The RD-CODOX-M/IVAC strategy is feasible and highly effective, but improving outcomes in elderly patients remains a priority.
