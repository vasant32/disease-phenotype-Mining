Growth transformation-associated Epstein-Barr virus-encoded genes are differentially regulated depending on the host cell phenotype. We have previously identified an LMP1 regulatory region (LRS) 5' of the LMP1 gene (+40 to -634) and analyzed its role in transcription initiation in the EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma line DG 75 (FÃ¥hraeus et al., 1990a). In order to investigate the cell phenotype dependence of LMP1 gene regulation we have now compared the activity of positive and negative cis-acting LRS elements in cell lines of B lymphoid and epithelial cell origin in the presence and absence of the virus-encoded nuclear antigen EBNA2. Our results show that reporter plasmids that contain only the -54/+40 region of LRS are active in all tested cell lines. Furthermore, the previously identified negative cis-elements in the -144/-54 region were found to suppress promoter activity independent of the cell phenotype. EBNA2 was able to override the effect of the negative elements in all lines of B-cell origin, whereas it had no effect in epithelial lines. The positive effect of EBNA2 was mediated by cis-acting elements in the -214/-144-bp region. In all six tested cell lines of epithelial origin, reporter plasmids that carried the full-length LRS were active, independent of EBNA2. The LMP1 promoter in these constructs was activated by the concerted action of EBNA2-independent, positive elements in the -214/-144 and -324/-214 positions that counteracted the effect of the negative LRS elements.
