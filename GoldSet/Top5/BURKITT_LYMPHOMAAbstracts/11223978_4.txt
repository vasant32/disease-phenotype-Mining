We have performed an allogeneic stem cell transplant in an 18-year-old male patient who had Burkitt's lymphoma. The patient had disease which was refractory to conventional intensive chemotherapy and radiation therapy. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue was given but the patient relapsed within 2 months after transplantation. He was then treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation using a fludarabine, busulfan and anti-thymocyte globulin-based conditioning regimen. His GVHD prophylaxis included mycophenolate and tacrolimus. The patient had engraftment within 14 days. Investigation by FISH showed more than 95% of his peripheral blood nucleated cells to be of donor origin since day +14. He is now alive and well and remains disease-free 6-months after the transplant. A graft-versus-lymphoma effect is thought to be one of the factors contributing to his remission.
