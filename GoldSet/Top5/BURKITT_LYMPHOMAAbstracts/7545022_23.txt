We report downregulatory effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on allogeneic immune responses in vitro. G-CSF did not affect the proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) against allogeneic Daudi cells but did inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha secretion. In contrast with G-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF and interleukin (IL)-3 enhanced alloactivation-induced TNF-alpha production. G-CSF-mediated suppression of TNF-alpha production was not affected by fixation of stimulators. G-CSF did not inhibit TNF-alpha mRNA expression or accelerate mRNA degradation, whereas pentoxifylline inhibited the expression of TNF-alpha mRNA. These results indicate that G-CSF acts directly on responder cells and modulates TNF-alpha production at posttranscriptional levels. Suppression of TNF-alpha secretion was accompanied by an increase of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentration in alloactivated PBMC. The cell-permeable cAMP analogue, dibutyryl cAMP, suppressed TNF-alpha secretion without affecting TNF-alpha mRNA expression. G-CSF showed an inhibitory effect on the development of cytotoxic effector cells against allogeneic Daudi cells. Anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody (MoAb) also inhibited the induction of cytolytic activity, and the inhibitory effects of G-CSF and anti-TNF-alpha MoAb on killer activity generation were overcome by adding exogenous TNF-alpha. Hence, impaired generation of cytolytic effector cells by G-CSF is believed to be the result of reduced TNF-alpha production. Collectively, the results described above suggest that G-CSF downregulates allogeneic immune responses by posttranscriptionally inhibiting TNF-alpha production.
