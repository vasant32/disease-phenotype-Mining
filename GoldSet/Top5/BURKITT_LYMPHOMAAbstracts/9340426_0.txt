The pediatric Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of malignancies of B- or T-cell origin. Approximately half of them are characterized as Burkitt's lymphomas. Typically, one of the reciprocal translocations t(8;14)(q24;q32), t(2;8)(p11;q24) or t(8;22)(q24;q11) is seen in the tumor cell, each involving the protooncogene c-myc on chromosome 8. Characteristically, in most patients the translocation occurs between the distal end of the long arm on chromosome 8 (c-myc) and chromosome 14 (immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, IgH). The breakpoint regions are distributed over a wide range of more than 10 Kb on chr. 8 and over several hundred Kb on chr. 14. With standard-PCR, fragments can only be amplified to a size of about 2 Kb. The development of PCR-applications to generate long products up to 20 Kb now allows a detection of these breakpoints. Several primer pairs from different regions of the IgH-gene and the c-myc-gene were tested in each patient. Until now, 20 patients with Burkitt's Lymphoma or B-ALL characterized by L3 morphology were examined. All patients were treated according the protocols of the NHL-BFM '90 or '95 study. In 11/20 patients, recombinations between chromosomes 8 and 14 could be detected with our primer pairs. In serial dilutions of DNA from malignant cells in DNA from healthy controls, sensitivities of one malignant cell in 2 x 10(4) normal cells could be obtained. This method will now allow us to characterize the involved breakpoints more exactly and to analyze patient samples (blood, bone marrow, aphereses products and residual tumors) during or after therapy for the existence of minimal residual tumor cells.
