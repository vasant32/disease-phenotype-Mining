Cytotoxic T cells from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immune individuals specifically kill EBV-transformed B cells from HLA class I antigen-matched donors even though the latently infected cells express only a restricted set of virus genes. The virus-induced target antigens recognized by these immune T cells have not been identified. In our experiments, EBV DNA sequences encoding the virus latent gene products Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA)1, EBNA 2, and EBNA-LP and the latent membrane protein (LMP) were individually expressed in a virus-negative human B-lymphoma cell line, Louckes. Transfected clones expressing LMP were killed by EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell preparations from each of three virus-immune donors HLA matched with Louckes through HLA-A2, B44 antigens; control transfectants or clones expressing one of the EBNA proteins were not recognized. Expression of LMP in a second virus-negative B-cell line, BL41, sensitized these cells to EBV-specific cytolysis restricted through the HLA-A11 antigen. To distinguish between the viral protein and an induced human B-cell activation antigen as the target for T-cell recognition, LMP was then expressed in a murine mastocytoma cell line, P815-A11-restricted human T cells. The LMP-expressing P815-A11 transfectants were susceptible to lysis by EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells from three HLA-A11-positive individuals. Both Louckes and P815-A11 cells were also transfected with constructs capable of encoding a truncated form of LMP (Tr-LMP) which lacks the N-terminal 128 amino acids of the full-length protein. Tr-LMP-expressing transfectants were not recognized by the above T-cell preparations. The results suggest that LMP, and, in particular, epitopes derived from the N-terminal region of the protein, provides one of the target antigens for the EBV-induced human cytotoxic T-cell response.
