Twenty-two patients with Burkitt's lymphoma in complete remission induced by either cyclophosphamide or a combination of cyclophosphamide, oncovin and methotrexate were randomized to receive or not to receive prophylactic cerebrospinal irradiation. Six of 11 irradiated patients relapsed with tumour of the central nervous system as compared to 4 of 11 controls. Relapse frequency appeared to be related to stage of disease on admission. It is concluded that irradiation does not prevent relapse.
