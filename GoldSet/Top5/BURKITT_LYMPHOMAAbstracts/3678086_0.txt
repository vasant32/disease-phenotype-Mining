A tumor lysis syndrome with hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hyperuricaemia and hypocalcaemia developed 48 hours after start of combined cytostatic treatment in a 16-year-old boy with Burkitt's lymphoma. Despite prophylactic administration of allopurinol and urinary alkalization, postrenal precipitation of urates and calcium phosphate caused acute renal failure. Ureteric splinting and percutaneous fistulization of the contralateral renal pelvis became necessary. Elevated renal retention values became normal after these measures and infusions with balanced alkalized electrolyte solutions, and the hypocalcaemia was counteracted.
