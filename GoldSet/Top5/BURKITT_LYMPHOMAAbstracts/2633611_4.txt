Resistance to drugs, either primary or acquired, is a main problem in cancer chemotherapy. The paper summarizes our results in regard to resistance to methotrexate and multiple drug resistance in human cell lines of pediatric malignancies and in children with resistant cancer. In cell lines as well as in children we could demonstrate amplification of the gene coding for dihydrofolate reductase as a cause for resistance to MTX. Procedures to overcome drug resistance such as treatment with high dose MTX and leucovorin rescue are discussed. The increased expression of the mdrl gene coding for the P-glycoprotein is related to multidrug resistance. This could be shown in cell lines and in children. The expression decreased when the drug, used for induction of resistance, was omitted for a few weeks from the cell culture medium. Readdition of the drug caused a rapid increase of expression. For the first time data in children are presented which demonstrate the amplification of the gene coding for dihydrofolate reductase or increased expression of the mdrl gene as cause of drug resistance. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.
