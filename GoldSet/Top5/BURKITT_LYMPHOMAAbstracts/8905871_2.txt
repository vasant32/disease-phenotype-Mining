Two newly established human Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (HBL-7 and HBL-8) were characterized by immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and molecular studies. Both cell lines were negative for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome and had chromosomal translocation: t(8;14) (q24;q32). Immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement analyses confirmed that both cell lines were derived from primary lymphoma cells. These cell lines were heterotransplanted subcutaneously into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice to investigate the metastatic capacity. The most striking feature of both cell lines was to show highly spontaneous metastasis to distant organs, particularly spleen, bone marrow and ovaries in SCID mice. To elucidate the metastatic factors involved in the process of spontaneous metastasis, cell surface adhesion molecules or extracellular matrix receptors were analyzed. However, the results did not allow a significant correlation between expression levels of those molecules or matrix receptors and spontaneous metastasis in the SCID mouse model. The HBL-7 and HBL-8 cell lines, however, may be a useful tool to elucidate the metastatic mechanisms of human lymphomas in an animal model.
