The lymphoid follicle is a specialized microenvironment for the differentiation of antigen (Ag)-activated B cells; the major stromal cell components in lymphoid follicle are the follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). At the same time, most of the B-cell lymphomas originate from the germinal center, and the generation and blast transformation of B-cell lymphoma occurs in close association with FDCs in the early stage of tumorigenesis. To study the functional roles of FDCs in lymphomagenesis, we established an inducible tumor model. The human B-cell lymphoma cell line, L3055, formed solid tumors only when inoculated with an FDC line, HK. In addition, 2 FDC-signaling molecules (FDC-SMs), a novel protein 8D6 and 4G10/CD44, are required for tumor formation in vivo, because monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to these 2 proteins inhibited lymphomagenesis completely when they were inoculated with L3055 and HK cells. However, these 2 FDC-SMs have distinct functional roles in tumor formation. FDC-SM-8D6 enhances L3055 cell proliferation, whereas FDC-SM-4G10/CD44 inhibits its apoptosis. Identification of the functional roles of these critical FDC-SMs may lead to the discovery of therapeutic drugs that suppress the survival and growth of lymphoma cells.
