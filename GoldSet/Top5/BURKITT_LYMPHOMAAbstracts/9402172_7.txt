BACKGROUND: Burkitt's lymphoma is a B-cell neoplasm characterized by a chromosomal translocation involving the c-myc gene. BL may carry, besides the c-myc translocation, several other lesions including a) mutations in c-myc, b) mutations in bcl-6, c) mutations in p53 and d) EBV genomes. In this report we describe a unique study of the timing of these genetic lesions during the evolution and progression of Burkitt's lymphoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From each of two patients with Burkitt's lymphoma, we established three different cell lines from different sites or at different times in the clinical course of the disease (diagnosis and relapse). Chromosomal aberrations were analyzed by karyotyping and the presence of molecular lesions determined by Southern blot, PCR, SSCP and sequence analyses. RESULTS: In each patient all the clones carry identical c-myc translocations, identical bcl-6 status (wild type or mutant) and the same productive VDJ rearrangement. However, within each individual patient, we could demonstrate the presence of intraclonal variation with respect to EBV, p53 mutations and c-myc mutations. CONCLUSIONS: c-myc translocation and bcl-6 mutations appear to be early events, mutations in the coding region of c-myc occur early but are an ongoing event, while mutations in the p53 gene seem to occur later. Discrete clonal bands reflecting independent EBV infection were observed in the cell lines from one HIV-associated Burkitt's lymphoma, suggesting the possibility that EBV infection may occur as a late event, at least in some HIV associated lymphomas.
