A cDNA clone containing the complete coding sequence for the human nucleolar phosphoprotein B23 was isolated from a Burkitt's lymphoma cDNA library by immunoscreening with human autoantibodies. The B23 clone contained a 1.3 kb cDNA insert encoding a polypeptide of 294 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 32,539 daltons. The deduced B23 amino acid sequence contained 2 acidic domains rich in aspartic and glutamic acid, a feature shared by a number of nuclear and nucleolar proteins. The human B23 amino acid sequence showed 98% homology with rat B23 and 68% homology with the Xenopus laevis nucleolar phosphoprotein, NO38 showing that the primary structure of B23 is highly conserved among these species.
