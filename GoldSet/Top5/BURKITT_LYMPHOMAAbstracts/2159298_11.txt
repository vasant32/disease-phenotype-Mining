Ia antigen is a receptor for the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA). Peptides I-A beta b(30-60), I-A beta b(50-70), I-A beta b(65-85), and I-A beta b(80-100) of the MHC class II antigen beta chain on mouse (H-2b) accessory cells were synthesized. Only I-A beta b(65-85) inhibited SEA binding to the mouse B-cell lymphoma line, A20 (H-2d) and the human Burkitt's lymphoma line, Raji (HLA-DR). The I-A beta b(65-85) sequence is a predicted alpha-helix along the hypothetical antigen binding cleft of the Ia molecule. I-A beta b(65-85) also directly and specifically bound both the intact SEA molecule and its Ia binding site, represented by the peptide SEA(1-45). The results suggest that I-A beta b region (65-85) is a necessary site for Ia molecular interaction with the superantigen SEA. Further, the data suggest that the same helical region of other Ia antigens binds SEA irrespective of haplotype and species.
