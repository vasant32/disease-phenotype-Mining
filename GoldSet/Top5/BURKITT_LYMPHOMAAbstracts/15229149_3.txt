 BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry of lineage markers is useful in the classification of leukemias. Our aim was to assess whether the study of lineage genes at the RNA level would enable differentiation of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) from B-and T-lineage acute lymphoid leukemias (ALLs). METHODS: We measured mRNA of four lineage markers [CD19, CD79a, CD3e, and myeloperoxidase (MPO)] by reverse transcription followed by real-time quantitative (RTQ)-PCR. We investigated 72 acute leukemias (40 AMLs with 23-93% blast cells plus 27 B-lineage ALLs and 5 T-lineage ALLs) defined by morphologic criteria at diagnosis. RTQ-PCR analysis was performed on bone marrow without cell sorting. The expression of each gene was calculated as the difference in the threshold cycle [DeltaCT; CT value of target gene minus CT value of housekeeping gene (Abelson)]. RESULTS: Three patterns of expression were detected. In the first, CD19, CD79a, and MPO mRNAs were less abundant than CD3e. In the second pattern, MPO mRNA was more abundant than the other three mRNAs. In the third, CD19 or CD79a was more highly expressed than CD3e and MPO. The three patterns corresponded to T-ALL, AML, and B-ALL, respectively. The use of cutoffs to establish qualitatively the pattern of coexpression of the four lineage markers provided the same information as the comparison among the four DeltaCT values. Prospective use of the scoring system correctly classified each of 13 additional cases (8 AML, 4 B-lineage ALL, and 1 T-lineage ALL). CONCLUSION: Study of lineage markers at diagnosis by RTQ-PCR allows differentiation of AML from B-ALL or T-ALL without cell sorting, even when the bone marrow contains few blast cells.
