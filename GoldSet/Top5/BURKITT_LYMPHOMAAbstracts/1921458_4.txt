We have shown that incubation of bone marrow (BM) with interleukin 2 (IL-2) generates activated bone marrow cells (ABM) with potent tumoricidal activity in vitro and in vivo. The present study was carried out to define the interaction of other cytokines with IL-2 in generation of ABM. Our data show that interleukin 1 (IL-1), interferon (IFN)- both gamma and alpha, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) significantly increased the cytolytic potential of ABM. Interleukin 3, interleukin 4, transforming growth factor-beta and adherent cells were reduced, while granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor had no influence on the generation of cytolytic activity. IL-1 was enhanced while TNF-alpha depressed the BM progenitor cell activity in vitro. The IL-2-induced purging ability of BM contaminated with leukemic cells was increased by IL-1, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. This study shows that biomodulation of BM with combination of cytokines in vitro can be useful in purging a large leukemic burden.
