Using Western blot analysis, we examined cyclin E and cyclin A protein levels in 19 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ([ALL] 15 B-ALL and four T-ALL). Whereas normal, nonproliferating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) expressed low levels of the 50-kD cyclin E, ALL blasts in the peripheral blood, although showing low-level or no proliferation as judged by FACS/cell-cycle analysis and cyclin A protein levels, expressed high levels of cyclin E, with a mean value similar to that of the proliferating Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Akata. The accumulation of a protein shown to shorten the G1 phase of the cell cycle, cyclin E, in growth-delayed leukemic blasts may reflect the malignant status of these cells. Before treatment, B-ALL cells expressed predominantly the 50-kD cyclin E. T-ALL samples displayed the 50-kD cyclin E protein and a smaller, approximately 43-kD cyclin E species. In paired B-ALL samples taken before treatment and at relapse, we found a significant overexpression of the 50-kD protein in relapsed samples (P < .006), plus the presence of up to four additional smaller-molecular-weight species of cyclin E, illustrating clear diagnosis versus relapse differences. Cyclin E expression in ALL blasts may correlate to the relative malignant status of the cells, with higher protein levels reflecting a more advanced stage of the disease and a greater potential to proliferate under permissive conditions.
