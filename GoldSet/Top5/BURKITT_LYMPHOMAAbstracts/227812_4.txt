In a collection of near-diploid and near-tetraploid Raji sublines and somatic Raji/Raji hybrids a linear relationship was found between the number of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome copies and the relative amount of EBV-determined nuclear antigen per cell. Inducibility of the viral cycle by iododeoxyuridine and by P3HR-1 virus superinfection coulb be related to the number of resident EBV genome copies per haploid target cell. The implications of these findings are discussed.
