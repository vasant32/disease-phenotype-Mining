Human Class I HLA antigens (HLA-A,B,C) were isolated by immune precipitation from cells labelled with 32P, [35S]methionine or 125I (by lactoperoxidase-catalysed cell-surface iodination) and were analysed using both one- and two-dimensional electrophoretic systems. In several B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and in human peripheral blood lymphocytes the electrophoretic mobility of the 32P-labelled HLA-A,B,C heavy chains consistently differed from that of molecules labelled by other means. Thus the 32P-labelled heavy chains appeared to be larger and to possess a more acidic pI than did heavy chains labelled with [35S]methionine or 125I, or identified by Coomassie Blue staining. Phosphatase treatment of immunoprecipitates, under conditions where 32P-labelled antigens were shown to be dephosphorylated, did not affect the mobilities of the [35S]methionine-labelled heavy chains. On glycosidase treatment, the positions of the 32P-labelled heavy chains were affected by neuraminidase but not by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. These results imply that phosphorylated HLA-A,B,C antigens comprise only a small proportion (relative to the total cellular HLA-A,B,C antigens) of the biosynthetically mature molecules. The possible significance of such heterogeneity is discussed.
