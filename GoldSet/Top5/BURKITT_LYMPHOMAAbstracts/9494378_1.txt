OBJECT: To analyze our experience in the treatment of primary colorectal lymphomas. PATIENTS: During the recent period from 1989 to 1995, a total number of 406 cases of malignant neoplasms of large intestine were treated at Department of Surgery, Hospital del S.A.S de Jerez de la Frontera. There were 5 cases of primary colorectal Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, constituting 1.2% of all colorectal malignancies. METHODS: Medical records of all five patients were carefully reviewed. Surgical pathology specimens were retrospectively reexamined to confirm the diagnosis, and immunohistochemistry staining methods were performed. Dawson, Cornes and Morson criteria were used to distinguish primary colonic lymphoma. For tumor staging, a modification of the Ann-Arbor system for gastrointestinal lymphoma proposed by Musshoff and Schmidt-Vollmer was used. RESULTS: All cases were Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. There were no cases of lymphoma of the rectum. There were 2 males and 3 females. Their ages ranged from 12 to 73 years, with an average age of 31 years. The cecum was the site of the lesions in 4 patients and the other was located in the sigmoid colon. Acute abdomen in three cases, undiagnosed abdominal mass in one and intussusception in the other one were the clinical presentation. Inmunohistochemical studies showed B-cell phenotype in 4 and non-B non-T Ki-1-positive phenotype in 1 patient. Chemotherapy was administered following resection in 100% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative diagnosis of lymphoma was not suspected in all cases but the malignancy was always present. The cecum is the commonest site of involvement. Both of our two patients presented with perforated lymphoma were associated with a poor short term prognosis. It is necessary to unify the staging system and the histologic classifications enabling a comparison of several studies.
