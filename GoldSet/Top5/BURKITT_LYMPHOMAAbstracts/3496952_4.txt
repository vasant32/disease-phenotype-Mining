A cell line is described with a typical Burkitt lymphoma (BL) marker 14q+ due to the classical reciprocal translocation between chromosome #8 and #14 with breakpoints at 8q24.1 and 14q32.3. In addition, an interstitial piece from the long arm of 12(q24.1-q24.3) is inserted at the site of the exchange on chromosome #8, proximal to 14q32.3.
