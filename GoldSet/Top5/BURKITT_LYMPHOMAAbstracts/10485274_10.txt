The expression of adhesion molecules on CD34+ cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-lineage ALL) was compared with that on the myeloid and B-lymphoid CD34+ cells in normal bone marrow. Bone marrow aspirates of 10 patients with AML, 8 patients with B-lineage ALL and of 6 healthy volunteers were examined. The phenotype of the CD34+ cells was determined with a double immunofluorescence method and flow cytometry. CD34+ cells in AML and B-lineage ALL showed a lower expression of VLA-2 and VLA-3 and a higher expression of ICAM-1 and LFA-3 than their normal bone marrow counterparts. AML CD34+ cells had less L-selectin but more VLA-5 on their surface membrane than normal myeloid CD34+ cells. B-lineage ALL CD34+ cells showed an overexpression of LFA-3. In individual patients deficiencies or over-expression of the beta1 integrin chain, VLA-4, PECAM-1 or HCAM also occurred. An abnormal adhesive capacity of the leukemic cells may influence their proliferation, their localisation and apoptosis. An aberrant expression of adhesion molecules may be used for the detection of minimal residual leukemia in these patients.
