Burkitt's lymphoma is a malignant proliferation of undifferentiated B lymphocytes that most often affects children. In endemic areas of Africa, the jaws are the sites most frequently involved. In non-endemic areas of North America, the jaws are involved in only 15-18 per cent of the cases. The oral and maxillofacial surgeon can play an important role in the early diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma by recognizing the clinical signs of multiple loose teeth and jaw tenderness coupled with the radiographic signs of generalized destruction of tooth crypts and diffuse disruption of jaw trabeculation. Successful treatment results from a combination of early diagnosis and controlled chemotherapy.
