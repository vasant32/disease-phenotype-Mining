This study was aimed to investigate the value of CD58 in evaluation of early therapeutic effect on childhood B-ALL. The expression features of CD58 in 135 cases of childhood B-ALL were analyzed by four-color flow cytometry; MRD detection protocol for B-ALL using CD58/CD10/CD34/CD19 combination was established; the correlation between the expression features of CD58 and MRD detection was analyzed for the early therapeutic response in childhood B-ALL. The results showed that the mean value of CD58 MFI in 135 cases of B-ALL was 113.08 +/- 63.33, which was significantly higher than that in 15 cases of normal bone marrow controls (14.68 +/- 5.26, P < 0.01). In addition, CD58 was over expressed in 51.9% (70/135) of B-ALL patients, indicating that CD58 could be an effective marker in MRD detection. The CD58/CD10/CD34/CD19 was the second most effective combination next to TdT/CD10/CD34/CD19 in B-ALL MRD detection with flow cytometry. Meanwhile, the positive rate of MRD detection by flow cytometry was significantly lower in CD58 over expression group (P < 0.05). It is concluded that CD58 may be used as an indicator for detection of MRD in B-ALL patients, which would enrich the combination of MRD detection. The CD58 over expression may be considered as a marker of a favorable prognosis in childhood B-ALL.
