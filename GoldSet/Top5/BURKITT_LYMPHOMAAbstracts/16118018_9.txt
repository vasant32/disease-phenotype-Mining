Scanty information is available on chemokine receptor expression and function in childhood B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Thirteen pro-B, 17 early pre-B, 12 pre-B, and 9 B-ALL/Burkitt lymphoma (BL) pediatric cases were tested for CXCR1 to CXCR5 and CCR1 to CCR7 expression. CXCR2, CXCR3, and CXCR4 were expressed in the majority of cases, while the other receptors were variably expressed or absent. CXCR4 mediated chemotaxis of all leukemic cell subtypes. Freshly isolated CCR7(+) early pre-B-ALL cells migrated to CCL19, whereas CCR7(+) pro-B- and pre-B-ALL cells were attracted by CCL19 only following culture with soluble recombinant CD40 ligand.
