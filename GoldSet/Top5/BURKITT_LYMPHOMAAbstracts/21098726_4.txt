5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) is the essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, important mediators of inflammation. This study investigated whether variants of 5-LO exist in human leukocytes. 5-LO mRNA isoforms that are consistent with alternative splicing were identified by RT-PCR in a cell line or cell type-specific pattern. All evaluated cells expressed mRNA containing all 14 exons of 5-LO with the expected splicing sites. Individual isoforms that retained intron 10 (α-10), lacked exon 13 (Δ-13), and lacked exons 10 and 13 (Δ-10,13) or that lacked the first 96 base pairs of exon 10 (Δ-p10) were identified. Immunoreactive bands coeluting with the cloned α-10 and Δ-13 isoforms were measured in primary neutrophils and in Raji cells. When expressed in HEK293 cells, alternative proteins were without catalytic activity. However, when coexpressed with the active full-length 5-LO, alternative isoforms significantly decreased the biosynthesis of 5-LO products by up to 44%, as assessed by reverse-phase HPLC analysis. Additionally, in stimulated neutrophils the full-length active 5-LO was detected by immunoblot in both nuclear and non-nuclear compartments, while the Δ-13 isoform was only detected in the nuclear fraction. These alternative 5-LO isoforms may represent a new mechanism for the regulation of the 5-LO pathway and lipid mediator biosynthesis.
