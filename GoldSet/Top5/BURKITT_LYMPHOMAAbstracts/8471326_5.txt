The treatment programme (regimen I) we designed in 1982 for advanced Burkitt's lymphoma was modified in 1986 as regimen IIA and IIB for patients presenting without or with bone marrow (BM) and/or nervous system involvement, respectively. Following a 5-week course of cytoreductive chemotherapy, including vincristine (VCR), cyclophosphamide (CPM), doxorubicin (DXR), high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) and intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine (ARAC), high-dose ARAC and cisplatin were given as a 4-day continuous infusion. Regimen I continued with an additional 3-week course including VCR, CPM, DXR and HDMTX, which was omitted in regimen IIA. In regimen IIB the initial cytoreductive chemotherapy was complemented by adding etoposide and increasing HDMTX doses, and by modifying the high-dose ARAC administration modality and was followed, once the bone marrow had recovered, by ifosfamide that concluded the programme. A total of 44 children (22 in regimen I and 22 in regimens IIA and IIB) were treated, with an overall response rate of 98%. 4 patients died as a result of treatment related complications. Survival, progression-free and event-free survival rates were 73, 70 and 63%, respectively, for regimen I, and 82, 90 and 82%, respectively, for regimen IIA and IIB. A short chemotherapeutic regimen, using alternating phase-specific and non-specific agents, is able to cure the majority of patients with advanced Burkitt's lymphoma.
