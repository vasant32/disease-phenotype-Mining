Studies were carried out on the distribution of HL-A antigens in 33 patients with Burkitt's lymphoma from several tribal groups in Kenya. The frequency of distribution of the HL-A antigens was not significantly different in these patients from that in a selected control population. Difficulty was experienced in the precise identification of some HL-A antigens in Africans using a Caucasoid serum panel, in particular those associated with HL-A7 and to a lesser extent, the "W19" complex.
