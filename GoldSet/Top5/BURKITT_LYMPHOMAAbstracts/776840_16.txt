A randomized clinical trial designed to compare the effectiveness of cytoxan (CTX) alone versus a combination consisting of CTX, vincristine (Oncovin) and methotrexate (COM) in the treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) was carried out. Nineteen patients were selected at random to receive CTX alone while 21 received COM. The two treatment regimens were equally effective in inducing remissions, and complete response rates of 83.3% and 84.3% were observed for CTX- and COM-treated patients, respectively. The relapse frequencies were also equal but the pattern of relapse was clearly different. Seven out of 8 (87.5%) in the CTX group relapsed with systemic and central nervous system (CNS) tumor, while 8 out of 10 (80%) in the COM group relapsed with CNS disease only. This difference is highly significant p = 0.008. The remission durations and survival to date are the same.
