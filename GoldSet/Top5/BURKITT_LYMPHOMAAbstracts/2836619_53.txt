Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) codes for at least three glycoproteins, gp350, gp220, and gp85. The two largest glycoproteins are thought to be involved in the attachment of the virus to its receptor on B cells, but despite the fact that gp85 induces neutralizing antibody, no function has been attributed to it. As an indirect approach to understanding the role of gp85 in the initiation of infection, we determined the point at which a neutralizing, monoclonal antibody that reacted with the glycoprotein interfered with virus replication. The antibody had no effect on virus binding. To examine the effect of the antibody on later stages of infection, the fusion assay of Hoekstra and colleagues (D. Hoekstra, T. de Boer, K. Klappe, and J. Wilshaut, Biochemistry 23:5675-5681, 1984) was adapted for use with EBV. The virus was labeled with a fluorescent amphiphile that was self-quenched at the high concentration obtained in the virus membrane. When the virus and cell membrane fused, there was a measurable relief of self-quenching that could be monitored kinetically. Labeling had no effect on virus binding or infectivity. The assay could be used to monitor virus fusion with lymphoblastoid lines or normal B cells, and its validity was confirmed by the use of fixed cells and the Molt 4 cell line, which binds but does not internalize the virus. The monoclonal antibody to gp85 that neutralized virus infectivity, but not a second nonneutralizing antibody to the same molecule, inhibited the relief of self-quenching in a dose-dependent manner. This finding suggests that gp85 may play an active role in the fusion of EBV with B-cell membranes.
