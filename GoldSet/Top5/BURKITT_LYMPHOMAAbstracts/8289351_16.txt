Specific expression of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immediate-early and early gene products Zta, Rta, I'ta, and MSta by a recombinant vaccinia virus system allowed us to analyze the first steps in the induction of the lytic cycle in EBV-infected Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Significant differences in the induction of early genes were found between these cell types: whereas in BL cells the trans activator Zta was found to induce key steps of the early lytic cycle, only minor activities of Zta were noted in LCLs. Contrary to Zta, the trans activator Rta was found to be highly effective in LCLs. These observations suggest that Rta may play an important role in the activation of the early lytic cycle in LCLs, although it cannot be activated by Zta. The latter may be a reason for the lower tendency of LCLs to switch into the lytic cycle compared with BL cells or differentiated epithelial cells.
