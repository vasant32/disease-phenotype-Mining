Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has previously been classified into two different types according to the organization of the EB nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) gene region. Type A virus hybridizes with probes from B95-8 or M-ABA viruses and the B type virus with probes from the Jijoye virus strain. The substituted region in EBV type B codes for a different, but related EBNA2 antigen, named EBNA2B as opposed to EBNA2A. In this study Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, previously typed according to the EBV viral genomes they carry, as well as some matching lymphoblastoid cell lines were examined by immunoblotting for the expression of both EBNA1 and EBNA2 antigens. Variation in the molecular weight of EBNA1 indicated that both A and B virus types contained a variety of different virus isolates. EBNA2A was identified in all lines carrying A type viral genomes, but was not observed in any of the lines harboring B type virus. EBNA2B was identified in 4 of 10 Burkitt lymphoma lines carrying EBV type B.
