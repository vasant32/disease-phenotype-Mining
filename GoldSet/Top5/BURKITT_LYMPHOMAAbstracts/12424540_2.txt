To investigate the problem of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) for advanced stage patients, we retrospectively analyzed 24 consecutive patients who underwent allo-BMT in the non-remission stage. Twenty-four patients (19 males and 5 females) with acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and malignant lymphoma underwent allo-BMT. The patients had a median age of 30 years. There were eight cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), six cases acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), nine cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and one case of Burkitt's lymphoma. The 3-year overall survival rate was 22.5%, with a median survival time of 206 days in AML, 345 days in ALL, and 363 days in CML. Overall survival was associated with a recovery of platelets of less than 30 days and an acute graft-versus-host disease (acute GVHD) presence of less than grade II ( p=0.042). Fourteen patients died of transplantation-related diseases. Our important problem is to decrease transplantation-related deaths in allo-BMT during the non-remission stage, and longer survival can be expected with better pretreatment and prophylaxis for GVHD. In addition, the selection of the source of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at an optimal time is considered to be another problem to be approached.
