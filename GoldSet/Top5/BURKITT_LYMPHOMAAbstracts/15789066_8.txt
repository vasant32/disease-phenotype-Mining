Philadelphia-positive (Ph(+)) B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) is a genetically heterogeneous disease with a very poor prognosis. In this study, we analyzed the frequency of supernumerary Ph, trisomy 8, monosomy 7, and del(9p21) by FISH and its relationship with the characteristics of the disease, in 46 BCR/ABL(+) adult BCP-ALL patients. The frequency of supernumerary Ph, trisomy 8, monosomy 7 and del(9p21) was 30%, 20%, 15%, and 24%, respectively. Although all patients displayed a BII/common phenotype, supernumerary Ph and trisomy 8 were associated with higher expression of CD19 and CD22 and of CD19, CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR, respectively; in turn, cases with monosomy 7 showed lower CD19, CD22, CD34, and cCD79a and del(9p21)(+) blasts were CD13(-) and CD33(-). Overall, similar clinical and hematological features were observed at presentation, independently of the underlying genetic abnormalities. However, relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly shorter in cases with supernumerary Ph, trisomy 8, and del(9p21), the latter being the most powerful independent prognostic factor for RFS.
