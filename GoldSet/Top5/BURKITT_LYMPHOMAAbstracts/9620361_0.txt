A number of novel genes activated by type I interferons (IFNs) were identified by differential display. Of five induced genes examined, four were of unknown function. However, one gene sequence was identical to the human spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine catabolism. This enzyme was induced by type I IFNs in a series of hematopoietic cell lines, including Daudi, HL-60, HPBMa, and Wil-2. No induction above constitutive levels occurred in a cell line of epithelial (ME180) or liver (HepG2) origin following treatment with type I IFN. Spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase was not induced by IFN-gamma in Daudi or ME180 cells. That induction occurred not only at the level of transcription but also at the enzyme level was confirmed by direct enzyme assays. As the levels of polyamines are related to cell viability, we propose that induction of this enzyme by IFN may be directly related to the anti-proliferative response to type I IFNs.
