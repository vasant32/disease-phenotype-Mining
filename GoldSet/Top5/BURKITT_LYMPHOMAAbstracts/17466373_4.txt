A new NF-kappaB inhibitor, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in human Burkitt lymphoma, HS-Sultan and Daudi cell lines. The activation of caspase-3 and the cleavage of caspase substrate PARP were observed after treatment with DHMEQ. The induction of apoptosis by DHMEQ was prevented by the pretreatment of Burkitt lymphoma cells with pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-FMK. The expression of anti-apoptotic factors such as IAP-1 and XIAP was suppressed by DHMEQ. Phosphorylation of ERK and JNK was induced by DHMEQ. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that NF-kappaB might be an ideal target to develop for new anti-cancer drugs for Burkitt lymphoma.
