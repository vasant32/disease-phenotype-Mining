In the United States, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and other cytodiagnostic methods have been underutilized in the evaluation of masses in the pediatric age group. Cytopathologists and cytotechnologists are therefore relatively unfamiliar with the cellular features of lesions that occur in children. On the basis of the cytologic findings from 64 pediatric cases, including 56 FNABs and 8 intra-operative imprints, a differential diagnostic approach to lesions in this age group is presented. The majority of cases can be placed into 1 of 5 cytomorphologic categories: (1) round-cell pattern, (2) mixed inflammatory pattern, (3) spindle-cell pattern, (4) epithelial pattern, and (5) cystic pattern. Once a cytomorphologic category is determined, evaluation for unique cellular features, special studies, and clinical correlation allows a specific diagnosis to be made in most cases. Pitfalls in pediatric cytopathology are illustrated by discussion of the following cases: a renal Burkitt's lymphoma mimicking a Wilms' tumor, a traumatic neuroma masquerading as a recurrent malignant schwannoma, Langerhans-cell histiocytosis resembling granulomatous inflammation, and a cystic granuloma that mimicked a branchial cleft cyst. Consideration of these problems and use of the recommended diagnostic approach will aid in interpretation in this difficult area.
