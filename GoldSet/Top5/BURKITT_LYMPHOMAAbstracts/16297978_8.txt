We have identified genes differentially expressed in childhood early B acute lymphoblastic leukemia at diagnosis, according to chemosensitivity. Chemosensitive (M1) and chemoresistant (M3) patients present <5% and >25% of residual leukemic blasts at 21 days of treatment, respectively. The expression profiles of 4205 genes for 32 patients included in the FRALLE93 protocol have been determined using microarray. From differential analysis, CD34, SPI-B and BCR distinguished M1 from M3 patients using microarray and RT-PCR data. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and cross-validation show that the combined expression of these three genes classify and predict correctly around 90% and 80% of patients, respectively.
