During studies of T-cell recognition of autologous tumour cells, a number of tumour cell lines derived from patients with lymphoma proved to be poor stimulators of both autologous and allogeneic T-cell responses. Analysis of the tumour cell surface molecules indicated that expression of the lymphocyte-function-associated antigen, LFA-1, was lacking, whereas normal leucocytes from these patients expressed normal levels of LFA-1. Examination of other lymphoid tumours revealed that most high grade lymphomas, but not most low or intermediate grade lymphomas, do not express the LFA-1 molecule. Furthermore, in an initial survey, the tumours from 5 of 7 patients with non-relapsing large cell lymphomas expressed LFA-1 whereas only 3 of 18 patients with relapsing lymphomas had tumours that did so. These findings suggest that tumour cells lacking surface LFA-1 cannot initiate an effective immune response in vivo. This lack of immunogenicity might contribute to escape from immunosurveillance.
