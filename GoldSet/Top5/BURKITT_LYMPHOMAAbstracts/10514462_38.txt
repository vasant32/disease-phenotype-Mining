Investigations into the capacity of the Bcl-2 protein to prevent apoptosis have targeted mitochondria as key sites of the preventative action accorded by Bcl-2 to cells. Using novel approaches with fluorescence probes and autofluorescence detection of endogenous NAD(P)H, we have examined the effects of expressing Bcl-2 in the Bcl-2 negative Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Daudi. We evaluated for the first time the effect of Bcl-2 expression on the intracellular distribution and production of hydrogen peroxide, under basal conditions and after treatment with apoptosis inducing agents, ceramide analogs and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Increased availability of mitochondrial NAD(P)H was detected in Bcl-2-expressing cells and was correlated with an increased constitutive mitochondrial production of hydrogen peroxide. Although production of hydrogen peroxide was increased by either C(6)-ceramide or TNF-alpha in Bcl-2 negative Daudi cells commensurate with the early phases of apoptosis, this increase did not occur in Bcl-2-expressing cells. Thus, Bcl-2 appears to allow cells to adapt to an increased state of oxidative stress, fortifying the cellular anti-oxidant defenses and counteracting the radical overproduction imposed by different cell death stimuli. Furthermore, we report altered cytological features of mitochondria during the early phases of apoptosis induced by C(6)-ceramide and TNF-alpha. In particular, mitochondria changed in appearance, clustering in the perinuclear region and Bcl-2 expression prevented these changes from occurring.
