Selection of primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as used in detection of the reconstructed genes of immunoglobulins and T-cells receptor in tumor cells in children with acute lymphatic leukemia is described in the paper. PCR potentialities and limitations in characterizing the monoclonality observed in primary acute lymphatic leukemia are demonstrated. Cross linkages of the heavy chain of immunoglobulins and of T-cell receptor were found between T- and B-linear acute lymphatic leukemia forms, but not between acute lymphatic leukemia forms and myeloleukemia in children.
