Receptors for the Fc of IgM were studied together with other lymphocyte markers on cells from nineteen human lymphoblastoid cell lines. Receptors for IgM were found on three of seven T lines and three of twelve B lines studied. Culture conditions needed for an optimal detection of the receptor were different for B and T lines. The presence of the receptor for IgM could not be correlated with that of any other membrane marker.
