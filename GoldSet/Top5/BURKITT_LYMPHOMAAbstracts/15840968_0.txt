 BACKGROUND: Dystrophic calcifications are uncommon in lymphomas. They may occur after chemotherapy or radiotherapy, whereas calcifications in untreated non- Hodgkin's lymphomas are rarely reported in the literature. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 9-year-old boy who developed tumefaction of the right upper jaw. CT examination revealed a neoplastic lesion in the right upper jaw sinus with destruction of the maxilla and subcutaneous fat infiltration. Furthermore the tumor showed accentuated central calcifications. Histological examination revealed endemic type of Burkitt's lymphoma of the paranasal sinus. CONCLUSION: Our experience showed that calcification can rarely occur also in untreated Burkitt's lymphoma.
