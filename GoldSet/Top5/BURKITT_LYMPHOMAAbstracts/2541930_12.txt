We have reported that Burkitt lymphomas (BL) that arise in HLA-A11 positive individuals are resistant to lysis by HLA-A11-specific and HLA-A11-restricted CTLs(10,11). Here we show that this phenomenon can be explained by a selective loss of the HLA-A11 polypeptide. The HLA-A11 negative phenotype is due to a regulatory phenomenon, rather than a structural defect, as proven by the ability to rescue expression of HLA-A11 in in vitro Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-converted sublines of EBV negative BLs.
