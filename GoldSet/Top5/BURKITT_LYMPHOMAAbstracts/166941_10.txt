Immunofluorescence absorption methods are described which permit quantitative estimation and differentiation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated antigens (virus capsid antigen, VCA, early antigen, EA and EBV-determined nuclear antigen, EBNA) in cell extracts. EBNA was present in all cell lines (producer and non-producer) which carried the EBV-genome, while VCA and EA were present in producer lines only. All the antigens were absent from a lymphoid cell line (MOLT-4) which lacked the EBV-genome, as well as from leukemia cells from peripheral blood. The techniques demonstrated antigenic identity of the various antigens when prepared from different cell lines.
