A monoclonal antibody, referred to as 38.13, was obtained by fusing murine myeloma cells with Lewis rat splenocytes sensitized with Daudi cells (human Burkitt lymphoma containing Epstein--Barr virus genome but lacking HLA-A, -B, and -C and beta 2-microglobulin molecules at the cell surface). 38.13 antibody was demonstrated to be a rat IgM. By complement-dependent microcytotoxicity and indirect immunofluorescence assays, 38.13 antibody was shown to react specifically with cells derived from Burkitt tumors, including both Epstein--Barr virus genome-carrying and Epstein--Barr virus-negative Burkitt lymphoma. By contrast, Epstein--Barr virus-containing lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from normal B lymphocytes were not recognized by 38.13 antibody. Fresh malignant cells from patients affected with various lymphoproliferative disorders were negative, except 4/8 having abdominal Burkitt-like lymphomas. Normal lymphocytes from peripheral blood, spleen, lymph node, tonsil, and bone marrow and mitogen (phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed mitogen, and concanavalin A)-activated blasts were also negative. Thus, 38.13 antibody apparently recognized a Burkitt-associated antigen that is not related to Epstein--Barr virus. The pattern of reactivity of 38.13 antibody with various Burkitt lymphoma cells appeared quite heterogenous and some Burkitt cells were consistently negative. 38.13 antibody thus defines a subset of Burkitt lymphomas.
