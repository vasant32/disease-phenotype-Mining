BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antitumor drug resistance and side effects of antitumor compounds are the most common problems in medicine. Therefore, finding new antitumor agents with low side effects could be interesting. This study was designed to assay antitumor activity of the extract from brown alga Sargassum oligocystum, gathered from Persian Gulf seashore, against K562 and Daudi human cancer cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research was performed as an in vitro study. The effect of the alga extract on proliferation of cell lines were measured by two methods: MTT assay and trypan blue exclusion test. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The most effective antitumor activity has been shown at concentrations 500 microg/ml and 400 microg/ml of the alga extract against Daudi and K562 cell lines, respectively. The results showed that the extracts of brown alga Sargassum oligocystum have remarkable antitumor activity against K562 and Daudi cell lines. It is justified to be suggested for further research such as algal extract fractionation and purification and in vivo studies in order to formulate natural compounds with antitumor activities.
