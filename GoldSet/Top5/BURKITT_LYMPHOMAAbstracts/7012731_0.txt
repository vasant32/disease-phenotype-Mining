Natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity (NCMC) of human peripheral lymphocytes against allogeneic tumor line (K-562) was substantially increased by the AB serum. Dialysis, a well as Sephadex G-200 gel filtration of AB serum revealed that the immunoglobulin containing fraction was the responsible factor for the increase. Results suggest the involvement of antibodies in NCMC. Autologous and allogeneic serum of patients with gynecological carcinoma inhibited (10-64%) and/or stimulated (10-250%) the NCMC activity in the patients. Residual NCMC activity exceeding 20% has been present after the trypsin digestion in serum free medium of effector lymphocytes. A similar 20% residual activity has been observed after the addition of anti-immunglobulin and antigen-antibody complexes, respectively. Our findings suggested the role of antibodies and serum factors in natural killer activity. Nonetheless other mechanisms resistant to trypsin treatment and of a certain specificity to tumor cells may not be excluded.
