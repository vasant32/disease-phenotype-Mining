The toxic subunit of a plant ricin has been conjugate by a disulfide bond to a polyclonal rabbit antibody specific for the L-chain of human IgG. Both the antibody and ricin A-chain retained their original biological activity after conjugation. This conjugate proved to be a potent cytotoxin for surface Ig positive Burkitt lymphoma EB-3 cells, growing in vitro and produced 50% inhibition of protein synthesis at level of 1.4 x 10(-9) M. When tested for cytotoxic action on target cells, the composite conjugate molecule was at least 100 times more effective than antibodies alone, ricin A-chain alone or a conjugate ricin A-chain--normal rabbit IgG.
