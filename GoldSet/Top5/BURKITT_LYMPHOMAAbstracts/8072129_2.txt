Analysis of 19 cases of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) with primary manifestation in gonads, diagnosed during 1984-1990 at AFIP Rawalpindi is presented. It constituted 10.4% of all extranodal lymphomas during the same period in this institute. Testis were more commonly involved. Mean age at diagnosis was 60.4 years and only 11.4% cases were below 50 years of age. Majority of the patients reported early (mean duration was 4.2 months). The mean tumour size was 3.2 cm. In a significant number of cases (43.5%). NHL was associated with hydrocoele. Diffuse large cell lymphoma was the predominant (73.70%) subtype in testicular lymphoma. One case of Burkitt's lymphoma presenting as ovarian mass was also noted. Most of these cases (56.4%) were in le stage according to Ann Arbor staging. More clinical work-up is required to delineate the course of this entity in Pakistan.
