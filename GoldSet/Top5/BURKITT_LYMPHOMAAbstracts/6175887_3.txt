A 32-year-old woman was treated for Burkitt's lymphoma diagnosed during the 22nd week of pregnancy. Chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin (Adriamycin), vincristine, teniposide (VM-26), cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (AVTEP) was given each 2.5 to 3 weeks from the time of the diagnosis until delivery in the 37th week. Bleomycin and intrathecal methotrexate were also given from the 35th week. The infant was born after an assisted vaginal delivery and was fully developed and normal in all respects. This paper confirms prior reports that cytotoxic chemotherapy may safely be given during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy without adverse effects on the fetus. To our knowledge it is the first report of the use of teniposide, a new podophyllin derivative, during pregnancy.
