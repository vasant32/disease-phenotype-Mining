A case of non-Burkitt's lymphoma (NBL) in a 31 months old female child is presented. Her kidneys were bilaterally enlarged. Although no abdominal mass was palpable, a sudden and unexpected bowel perforation has occurred. The diagnosis was established by autopsy studies. Because of its extremely rapid progression and in order to minimize the risk of life-threatening complications, children with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) should be quickly and extensively evaluated.
