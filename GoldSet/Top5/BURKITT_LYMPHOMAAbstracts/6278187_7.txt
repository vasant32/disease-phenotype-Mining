Four new somatic cell hybrids were obtained by fusion of various Burkitt's lymphoma (BL)-derived cell lines that had different selective markers: Raji-P3HR-1, Daudi-Raji, and a P3HR-1-P3HR-1 "autohybrid" derived from two P3HR-1 sublines. In addition, a hybrid was obtained between the Daudi (BL) line and the human leukemia cell line K562. The hybrids were extensively characterized by means of chromosome, isozyme, and HLA surface markers. The phenotypic differences between the parent cell lines allowed some conclusions with respect to the expression of latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes, C3 and EBV receptors, and of immunoglobulin and beta 2-microglobulin-HLA expression as well as the influence of the leukemia cell (K562) genome on B-cell properties in the Daudi-K562 hybrid. B-cell and differentiated markers of these hybrids were characterized. High-level expression dominated for the marker C3 and EBV receptors, which showed a good correlation coefficient of 0.84, as was true for Fc receptors and surface immunoglobulin. The Daudi-K562 hybrid showed loss of all B-cell markers but retention of the leukemia cell markers (e.g., hemoglobin synthesis).
