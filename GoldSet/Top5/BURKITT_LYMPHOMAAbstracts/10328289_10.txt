A new type of inhibitor of tubulin polymerization was discovered based on the 3-aroyl-2-arylbenzo[b]thiophene molecular skeleton. The lead compound in this series, 2-(4'-methoxyphenyl)-3-(3',4',5'-trimethoxybenzoyl)-6-methoxybe nzo[b]thiophene 1, inhibited tubulin polymerization, caused an increase in the mitotic index of CA46 Burkitt lymphoma cells, and inhibited the growth of several human cancer cell lines.
