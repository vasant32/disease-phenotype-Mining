Polymorphic B-cell lymphoma seen in four patients with congenital immunodeficiencies and in two patients with leukemia receiving chemotherapy was associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The tumors had characteristic histologic features: they were polymorphic consisting of a mixture of lymphoblasts and differentiated cells including plasma cells, and areas of hemorrhagic necrosis were prominent. The tumors were either polyclonal, monoclonal, or multiclonal. Patients with congenital immunodeficiencies who developed these tumors died despite radiotherapy, corticosteroids plus acyclovir, or a combination of intravenous (IV) immunoglobulins and alpha 2 interferon. Patients with leukemia recovered when immunosuppressive drugs were discontinued and leukemia has not recurred over a period of 2 and 4 years, respectively, in the two patients.
