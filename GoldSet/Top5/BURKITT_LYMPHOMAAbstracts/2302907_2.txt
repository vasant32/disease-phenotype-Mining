In an effort to better understand the epidemiology of cancer in Zaire, a retrospective review of biopsy-proven malignant tumors was undertaken. Of 188 biopsies taken from children aged 0-15 years over a 4.5 year period, 73 (39%) revealed malignancy. Fifty-six percent of patients with malignant tumors were boys. Lymphoma was the most common tumor (28 patients, 15 with Burkitt's Lymphoma). Sarcoma (15 patients), carcinoma (8 patients), Wilms' Tumor (6 patients), and retinoblastoma (5 patients) were also seen. Lymphomas were most heavily represented in the first 5 years of life, while sarcoma and carcinoma accounted for most of the malignancies in children after 10 years of age. Lymphomas and sarcomas are relatively more common in Zaire than in North America and Europe, while leukemia and central nervous system tumors are notably less common in Zaire. In view of current limitations on health care in rural Zaire, cancer care should be directed toward early diagnosis, quick referral for appropriate surgical care, and use of the limited arsenal of chemotherapy.
