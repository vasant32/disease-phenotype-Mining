B-cell lymphoproliferative syndromes (LPS) occurring in immunodeficient subjects are frequently associated with EBV infections. Histology as well as EBV-related serology are not diagnostic, but demonstration of EBV DNA in LPS suspected lesions might be useful for diagnosis. We studied four autopsied cases of LPS that developed in the setting of bone marrow transplantation, with proliferations ranging from poly- to monoclonal. Our protocol of DNA extraction allowed detection of EBV DNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens of all four cases. In dot blot hybridization the sensitivity in these specimens was 10% as compared to fresh frozen material, but still sufficient for a biotinylated probe. Southern blotting with the former DNA was not successful due to extensive degradation. In situ hybridization resulted in positive signals in all cases, using either 35S or 3H labeled probes. The labeling pattern suggested virus replication in B cells of LPS. By this, LPS resembles productively infected lymphoblastoid cell lines rather than latently EBV-infected Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). These findings strengthen the concept of LPS as a distinct clinicopathologic entity, differing from monoclonal, latently EBV-infected BL, as well as from polyclonal infectious mononucleosis, and the more common EBV-negative Non-Hodgkin lymphomas of the immunocompetent host.
