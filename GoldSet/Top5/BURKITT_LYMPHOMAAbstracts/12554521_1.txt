Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) in children are the second most common malignant tumors in Kuwait. Until 1995 the patients (pts) received institutional protocols. From October 1995 to September 2000 21 children with NHL were treated. Five children were treated by NHL BFM 90 protocol, 7 pts received NHL BFM 95 scheme, and 9 children underwent therapy abroad or according to different types of protocols. The results of a retrospective analysis of NHL BFM 95 protocol in Kuwait are reported. Seven patients diagnosed with NHL--group B: 3 children with Burkitt lymphoma (B-cell NHL) and group A: 4 children with lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-cell NHL)--were treated from October 1995 to September 2000 in the Kuwait Cancer Control Centre according to NHL BFM 95 protocol. Group B consisted of 2 girls and 1 boy; median age at diagnosis was 4 years 8 months, 2 pts classified as stage II and 1 pt as stage III. All patients were assigned to risk group R2. Median follow-up is 2 years 8 months. Group A included 1 girl and 3 boys; median age at diagnosis was 5 years 8 months, 1 pt classified as stage III and 3 pts as stage IV. All patients were assigned to IR group. Median follow-up is 3 years 6 months. In group B all 3 pts are in 1st CR; in group A 3 pts are in 1st CR and 1 pt having Li-Fraumani syndrome died after the 3rd relapse of disease during therapy. In both groups there was no toxic death, myelotoxicity WHO grade III-IV, hepatotoxicity WHO grade II-III. Treatment results of NHL BFM 95 study in our small group of patients are very optimistic. Six patients are in 1st CR and one died due to progression of disease. Despite the small group of patients, the results suggest that NHL BFM 95 protocol is highly effective and safe with regular supportive care.
