Triple fluorescence in situ hybridization with a plasmid DNA library from sorted human chromosomes 8 in combination with bacteriophage clones flanking the breakpoint in 8q24 of the Burkitt lymphoma cell line J1 was used for the specific delineation of this breakpoint in individual tumor cells. With this approach, tumor-specific breakpoints in translocation chromosomes can be detected at all stages of the cell cycle with high specificity.
