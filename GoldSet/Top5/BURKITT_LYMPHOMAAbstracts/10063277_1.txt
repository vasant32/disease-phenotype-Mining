Burkitt's lymphoma, the most common childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, usually presents with abdominal tumors. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in Burkitt's lymphoma is mostly secondary to advanced systemic disease, rarely with brain parenchymal lesions, and was previously recalcitrant to treatment. We report an unusual case of CNS Burkitt's lymphoma with minimal extraneural disease. This 10-year-old immunocompetent boy presented with increased intracranial pressure and seizures and was found to have multifocal intracerebral lesions on brain imaging studies. Cerebrospinal fluid studies confirmed the presence of Burkitt's lymphoma cells. Abdominal computed tomography showed bilateral nephromegaly with left intrarenal lesions that disappeared after three doses of intravenous dexamethasone. The patient was treated for 6.5 months according to the LMB 89 group C protocol of the French Pediatric Oncology Society. The response was brisk and complete. The patient has been disease free for more than 4 years, and is believed to be cured.
