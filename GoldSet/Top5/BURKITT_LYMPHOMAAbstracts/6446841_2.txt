Cytogenetic studies were performed on a biopsy specimen of a jaw tumor and on a bone marrow aspirate from a Japanese patient with Epstein-Barr virus-negative Burkitt's lymphoma. A 14q + chromosome was found in cells from either source, although each contained a different clone. Other karyotypic abnormalities present in common included 2dir dup (1q) (q21 leads to q32), 3q+, 6p--, +12, +mar.
