We report a 10-year-old male with widespread recurrent Burkitt's lymphoma who underwent successful mismatched unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) following salvage chemotherapy. He was conditioned with TBI, antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and high-dose VP-16 and achieved full donor engraftment. He experienced grade II skin and grade I gastrointestinal acute GVHD with no chronic GVHD. He is alive with no evidence of disease 24 months following UCBT.
