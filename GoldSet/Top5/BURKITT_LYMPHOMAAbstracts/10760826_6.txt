We have previously demonstrated that 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA), 9-cis-RA and all-trans-RA (ATRA) powerfully inhibit the proliferation of Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). The aim of the present study was to assess whether these compounds are effective at inhibiting the growth of B cells at more advanced stages of lymphomagenesis, including fully transformed B lymphocytes. To this end, c-myc-transfected LCLs (myc-LCLs) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines were used. We report that 13-cis-RA, 9-cis-RA and ATRA also markedly inhibit the proliferation of myc-LCLs by inducing G(0)/G(1) growth arrest as well as enhancing rates of apoptosis. Conversely, all but 1 (DG75) of the 8 BL cell lines investigated were poorly RA-responsive. Moreover, unlike LCLs and myc-LCLs, RA-treated DG75 cells rapidly resumed proliferation upon drug removal. Analysis of cell cycle-regulatory proteins showed that, as in LCLs, strong up-regulation of p27(Kip-1) and increased levels of under-phosphorylated pRb and p130 were detected in RA-treated DG75 cells. While the catalytic activity of all 3 G(1)-associated CDKs (CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6) was strongly inhibited in RA-treated LCLs, only CDK2-associated kinase activity was reduced in DG75 cells arrested in G(0)/G(1) by RA. Moreover, RA-treated DG75 cells failed to show the down-regulation of cyclin D3 observed in LCLs. Use of receptor-selective agonists and antagonists showed that in LCLs and RA-responsive BL cells, RA-induced growth arrest is mainly mediated by RARalpha. The RARalpha-selective agonist Ro 40-6055 was also effective at very low concentrations (10(-10) M). Nevertheless, comparable levels of RARalpha mRNA were found in RA-responsive and -resistant BL cell lines, indicating that mechanisms different from transcriptional deregulation of RARalpha probably underlie the differential responsiveness of BL cells.
