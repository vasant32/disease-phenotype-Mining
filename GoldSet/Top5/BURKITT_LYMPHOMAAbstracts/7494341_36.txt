In experimental B-cell infections, Epstein-Barr virus induced sustained expression of V(D)J recombinase-activating genes RAG1 and RAG2, whose aberrant activity has been implicated in chromosomal translocations in B-cell neoplasms. In cell lines in which RAG1 and RAG2 were detected, virus integrated into cellular DNA rather than assumed the configuration of extrachromosomal episomes. Expression of the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 in transient transfection assays was sufficient to induce both recombinase-activating genes.
