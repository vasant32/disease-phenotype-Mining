In this report we describe the synthesis and biological characterization of two series of sirtuins' inhibitors (SIRTi), designed as simplification products of the previously reported SIRT1-selective inhibitor MC2141 (4). In the first series (5a-t) we report a number of 2-substituted-1,2-dihydrobenzo[f]chromen-3-ones with a marked selectivity for the inhibition of SIRT2 over SIRT1. Some of such derivatives showed also high pro-apoptotic (5i and 5l) and/or cytodifferentiating (5d, 5i, and 5o) properties in a human leukemia cell line (U937). The second group of SIRTi (6a-q) is characterized by some analogues of cambinol (3), a well known SIRTi active against the Burkitt lymphoma. Such compounds, differently from the unselective prototype, are endowed with a selective inhibition of SIRT1 over SIRT2, and, in some cases (6j, 6k, and 6q), are more efficient than 3 to induce apoptosis in U937 cells.
