Burkitt lymphoma is the most common AIDS-related lymphoma (ARL) in childhood. The major issues in adult and pediatric ARL include identifying the optimal chemotherapy regimen and the concurrent treatment of both rituximab and highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). We present a case of advanced stage Burkitt lymphoma in an 8-year-old female with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), who was successfully treated with a 3 month course of modified CHOP-R (cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab) and HAART therapy. The combination of rituximab and chemotherapy with HAART therapy may be well-tolerated and effective in HIV/AIDS patients with Burkitt lymphoma.
