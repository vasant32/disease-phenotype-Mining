Histopatholgical findings in 242 lymph node biopsies received in Jos University Teaching Hospital over a 10-year period (1988-1997) were reviewed. Tuberculosis is the most predominant lesion (33.05%), followed closely by the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (31.4%). Burkitt's lymphoma accounting for one-quarter of all the cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had a peak age range of 8-10 years. Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic non-specific lymphadenitis, sinus histiocytosis, reactive hyperplasia, metastatic carcinoma, dermatopathic lymphadenitis, Kaposis sarcoma and sarcoidosis accounted for 2.9%, 14.46%, 9.9%, 4.96%, 1.7%, 0.4%, 0.8% and 0.4% respectively. The cervical region was the commonest site affected (54.1%), followed by mesenteric (22.3%), axillary (13.2%) and inguinal (10.3%). BCG immunization was carried out only on 121(50%) of cases, out of which 60 had tuberculosis and 54(22.3%) received no BCG immunization, while 67(27.7%) had no records of BCG immunization. Only 5(2%) had HIV screening done, out of which one was positive.
