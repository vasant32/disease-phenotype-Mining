In this report, we extend our previous findings that IgG or F(ab')2 fragments of HD37 anti-CD19 antibody (Ab) in combination with the immunotoxin (IT), RFB4-anti-CD22-deglycosylated ricin A chain (dgA) (but neither reagent alone), prolonged the survival of SCID mice with disseminated human Daudi lymphoma (SCID/Daudi mice) to 1 year at which time they still remained tumor-free. We explored the mechanisms by which the HD37 Ab exerts antitumor activity in vivo by studying its activity in vitro. We found that it has antiproliferative activity (IC50 = 5.2 - 9.8 x 10(-7) mol/L) on three CD19+ Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (Daudi, Raji, and Namalwa) but not on a weakly CD19-positive (CD19lo) pre-B cell tumor (Nalm-6). The inhibitory effect was manifested by cell cycle arrest, but not apoptosis. Results using three additional anti-CD19 Abs, suggest that the affinity of the antibody and possibly the epitope which it recognizes may effect its capacity to transmit a signal that induces cell cycle arrest. Hence, therapeutically useful Abs may exert anti-tumor activity by a variety of mechanisms, each of which should be evaluated before undertaking clinical trials in humans.
