Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) preparations from three sources were tested with sera from normal individuals and patients with Hodgkin's disease, breast carcinoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, and American and Chinese nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Individual sera with discordant antibody patterns were noted in all groups. Sera from both NPC groups gave significantly higher anti-EBNA titers on cell lines converted with P3HR-1 or B95-8 virus compared with anti-EBNA titers on Raji cells. Anti-EBNA titers of Chinese NPC sera showed no correlation among the three EBNA sources, while all other groups had highly correlated titers. Cross-absorption experiments present evidence for more than one antigenic determinant on EBNA. These results suggest an additional parameter for distinguishing Chinese NPC from other EBV-related disorders.
