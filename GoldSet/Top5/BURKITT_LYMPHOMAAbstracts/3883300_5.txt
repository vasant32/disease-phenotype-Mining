The imaging procedures utilized at presentation in the diagnostic work-up of 19 children with Burkitt lymphoma were reviewed. The distribution of disease was compared to other tumors of childhood so that the most valuable modalities could be identified. Burkitt lymphoma is a rapidly growing tumor in the child, making it essential to suggest the diagnosis as quickly as possible so that biopsy and treatment can be instigated. The primary area of involvement was abdominal (15 of 19), gastrointestinal, intraperitoneal adenopathy, hepatic and pancreatic without retroperitoneal adenopathy. Pleural effusions were common without hilar and mediastinal adenopathy. This is in contrast to other tumors of childhood where mediastinal and hilar disease in the chest and retroperitoneal node involvement in the abdomen are common. Thus sonography is an excellent imaging modality, easily identifying the extent of the disease and so suggesting the diagnosis.
