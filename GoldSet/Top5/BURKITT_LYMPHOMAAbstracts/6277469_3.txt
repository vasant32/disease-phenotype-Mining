Two among ten Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines contained a 14q+ marker in a low frequency of the cells (2 and 9%). By means of "mesome-prosome" analysis of the G-band patterns of these markers; it was established that the additional chromosome segments of these two 14q+ markers came from chromosomes #3 and #5, respectively, and not from chromosome #8 as in the 14q+ marker of Burkitt lymphoma. Chromosome #8 was not involved at all in any changes in the ten lymphoblastoid cell lines studied.
