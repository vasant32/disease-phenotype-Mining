Primary adrenal lymphoma is extraordinarily rare, in comparison with secondary adrenal involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although higher-resolution imaging techniques have enhanced detection of adrenal masses, biopsy or excision is often needed for definitive diagnosis. Percutaneous computed tomography-guided fine needle aspiration has great diagnostic value in the workup of adrenal masses, but is limited by sampling error and artifacts. Primary adrenal lymphoma most commonly manifests with diffuse large B-cell morphology. Burkitt-like large cell lymphoma morphology has been previously reported only once, to our knowledge. We report an 80-year-old man presenting with unilateral primary adrenal lymphoma showing Burkitt-like morphology and adrenal insufficiency. Fine needle aspiration yielded a dispersed population of monomorphic, medium to large cells suggestive of lymphoma. Although dispersed cell populations cytologically favor lymphoma, metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma and adrenal cortical carcinoma can manifest similarly. Integrated histological, immunohistochemical, and flow cytometric immunophenotyping would provide an accurate and definitive diagnosis. We review the literature and discuss important issues with regard to diagnosis.
