Primary hepatic lymphomas are exceedingly rare in children, with less than a dozen cases described to date. The authors present an 8.5-year-old boy with Burkitt lymphoma of the liver who had isolated multifocal liver lesions that exhibited a multilayered progressive enhancing pattern on MRI. Diagnosis was achieved after laparotomy and incisional biopsy that failed to detect disease outside the liver. The patient received short, intensive multiagent chemotherapy. He is currently well 22 months after the end of chemotherapy. This case illustrates that clinical judgment in conjunction with unusual imaging findings may contribute to the diagnosis of common tumors in rare locations.
