The presence and synthesis of c-myc protein and mRNA in the cell cycle has been studied. We find that c-myc mRNA is present, at equivalent levels, at all times in the cell cycle with the possible exception of mitosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this mRNA is transcribed in both G1 and G2 phases. An analysis of the c-myc protein in vivo shows that de novo synthesis occurs in G1 and G2 and the protein turns over with a half-life of approximately 20-30 min in both phases. Furthermore, the level of c-myc protein rapidly increases in cell populations when they re-initiate the cell cycle, thereafter decreasing as the culture reaches quiescence. The results therefore suggest that expression of c-myc can be rapidly modulated and that it is activated during the G0 to G1 transition, but is expressed thereafter in the cell cycle.
