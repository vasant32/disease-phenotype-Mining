Serum samples from 28 children with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were studied for the presence of HIV antigen. Their humoral immune response profile, including anti-HIV specific isotypic responses and neutralizing titers, was characterized. Additionally, serum specimens from 12 of these children were tested for their ability to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against HIV envelope antigens. Analysis of our results showed that children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were much more likely to have serum antigenemia and an absence of anti-p24 antibodies than those with AIDS-related complex (ARC). A significant association was also noted between a more stable clinical status and a strong anti-p24 antibody response with detectable antibodies to other HIV antigens in multiple antibody subclasses. This suggests that the longitudinal evaluation of antigen/antibody profiles may aid in the assessment of prognosis for children with HIV infection. Sera from 6/6 patients with ARC and 4/6 patients with AIDS were able to mediate ADCC. No correlation was found between clinical status and the titers of neutralizing antibodies.
