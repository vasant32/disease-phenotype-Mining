Burkitt lymphoma is a rapidly growing, high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurring in three distinct clinical subtypes: endemic, sporadic, and human immunodeficiency associated. The sporadic subtype typically presents as an abdominal mass. Orbital involvement has rarely been reported. The authors report a case of Burkitt lymphoma presenting as rapidly progressive proptosis and loss of vision. Given the tumor's rapid growth rate, potential for vision loss, and good response to chemotherapy, clinicians should be aware of this rare presentation.
