This review highlights three topics in which major contributions to lymphoma biology have recently been achieved. First, the use of single-cell polymerase chain reaction analysis has allowed for a better understanding of the origin of several entities, eg, Hodgkin's, Burkitt's, and marginal zone B-cell lymphomas. Second, the studies of mechanisms regulating apoptosis and survival of the neoplastic clones have opened a whole area of research with promising expectations for new therapeutical approaches. Finally, the recent cloning of genes involved in several chromosomal translocations is likely to shed more light on the molecular mechanisms responsible for the neoplastic transformation. The survey presents the main results obtained in these three areas and critically discusses them in the light of the current debate.
