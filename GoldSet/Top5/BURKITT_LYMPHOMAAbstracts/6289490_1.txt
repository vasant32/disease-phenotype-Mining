CHEV, a new Epstein-Barr virus negative Burkitt's lymphoma derived cell line has been studied. Karyotype analyses demonstrated the t (8; 14) characteristic translocation. Cell surface characterisation of this line showed the presence of mu and chi immunoglobulin chains and beta 2-microglobulin and the absence of the complement receptor. We are unable to detect HLA--A, B alloantigens on the cell surface which was in contrast with an apparently normal expression of these antigens in the cytoplasm.
