An in vitro culture of FLEB14 cells, an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell precursor containing the germ line immunoglobulin genes, gave rise to a uniclonally expanded variant, FLEB14 delta 3, which was rearranged at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus. Cytogenetic analysis showed that FLEB14 delta 3 had a novel reciprocal translocation, t(6;14)(q15;q32). Molecular cloning of the rearranged DNA fragments and determination of their nucleotide sequence revealed that the recombination event was reciprocal, imprecise, and nonhomologous and took place in the S mu region, like those found in Burkitt's lymphoma cells. We propose a molecular model to explain this genetic event which may be relevant to class switch recombination. The translocated sequence of chromosome 6 did not contain any known oncogenes, although the sequence is conserved among mammals. FLEB14 delta 3 did not show tumorigenicity.
