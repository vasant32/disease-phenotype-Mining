Interaction of UV-inactivated influenza A/X47 virus at high multiplicity caused a rapid inhibition in cellular protein and DNA synthesis, thus arresting Burkitt-lymphoma-derived Daudi cell multiplication, and eventually killing the cells. The mechanism of the cytolytic effect is presumably, linked to the increase in cell membrane permeability indicated by elevation in 51Cr release. This might be the consequence of the mass adsorption and/or penetration of viral particles.
