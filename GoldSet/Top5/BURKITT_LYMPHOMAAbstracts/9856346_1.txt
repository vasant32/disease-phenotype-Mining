Membrane glycoprotein 350 (gp350) of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is considered as a major target for vaccine development, since the gp350 has been identified as the virus' mediator for receptor interaction and as an inducer of specific in vitro virus-neutralizing antibodies. In an initial attempt to develop an effective DNA vaccine against an EBV infection, gp350 genes were isolated from SNU-20 and SNU-1103 which are the EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines established in Korea. In addition, the nucleotide sequences of the gp350 genes were determined and compared with those of other EBV strains such as B95-8, P3HR-1/AG876 and M81. Sequence analysis showed that similar high degrees of homology between 2 EBV strains derived from African Burkitt's lymphoma, P3HR-1 and AG876, was shown between the gp350 genes isolated from 2 EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines established in Korea. Furthermore, these 2 Korean and 2 African strains displayed nearly identical patterns of sequence variations from B95-8. In addition, the sequence of the isolated gp350 genes, which have been reported to be associated with the biology of EBV infection, is analyzed.
