13 cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were studied combining cell surface marker analysis with immunogenotyping by Southern blot hybridisation with a panel of antigen receptor gene probes. The immunophenotypes were unequivocal: 7 patients had B-phenotype and 6 patients T-phenotype ALL. In several patients immunogenotypes were not fully consistent with the respective phenotypes. For example, 2 B-cell precursor ALL had rearranged TCR beta chain genes and 2 T-ALL rearrangement of Ig heavy-chain genes. All cases showed clonal rearrangement or deletions within the TCR delta gene locus. TCR delta gene rearrangements might, therefore, serve as markers of clonality but not of B- or T-lineage in immature lymphoid neoplasms. We conclude that in current diagnostic practice immunogenotyping is a supplement rather than an alternative to immunophenotyping by surface marker analysis.
