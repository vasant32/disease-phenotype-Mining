Two adult patients with acute mixed lineage leukemia (AMLL) having combined Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) positivity and monosomy 7 are presented. The phenotypes of leukemic blasts from both cases were almost same (early B-lymphoid lineage and myeloid lineage); CD10+, CD13+, CD19+. HLA-DR+, and dual-color analysis showed simultaneous expression of CD10 (CD19) and CD13 antigens in individual blasts (biphenotypic) in both cases. On molecular analysis, the leukemic blasts showed rearrangement in the first intron of the BCR gene with breakpoint just outside of 3' end of m-BCR-2 (bcr 3) in case 1, and in the M-BCR in case 2. Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) rearrangement was noted in both cases, but rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta-chain gene (TCR beta) was detected only in case 1. Clinically, both cases achieved complete remission by the combination chemotherapy consisting of L-asparaginase, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (L-AdVP). In remission, all these molecular abnormalities disappeared in both patients. These results suggest that the Ph1-positive and monosomy 7 AMLL in adults is de novo acute leukemia with both early B-lymphoid and myeloid phenotypes and may arise from malignant transformation of pluripotent stem cell, and expresses a heterogenous rearrangement pattern of the BCR gene.
