During the two last decades, the prognosis of children with Burkitt lymphoma has improved dramatically. Treating patients with Bukitt lymphoma in countries with limited resources is a challenge. We report our results in a serie of 95 children with Burkitt lymphoma treated between September 1990 and December 2000 according to SFOP LMB89 protocol. The median age was 45 months (range 8 months, 18 years). Seventy three percent of patients had abdominal tumor and 10% had maxillary tumor. According to Murphy classification, one patient had stage I, 17 patients stage II, 60 patients stage III and 17 patients stage IV. When considering the LMB prognosis groups, 1 patient was in group A, 83 were in group B and 11 were in group C. 73 patients were evaluables for treatment results. Complete remission was achieved in 50 patients, of whom 6 relapsed. 18 patients died from early treatment toxicity. The 5 years relapse free survival rate was 56%. It was at 100%, 84%, 52% and 38% for stage I, II, III and IV respectively. These results are below what is expected with this protocol. Improvement of supportive-care is the main condition to reach western results.
