Morbid anatomy, University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH) caters for over 30 million people, mainly Black Africans. Sixty oral and jaw specimens were received and analyzed. In UNTH, Nigeria record of incidence and pattern of salivary lesions is scanty and, there had been no prior published report on this subject. This is a retrospective study to establish the pattern of oral and jaw tumours seen in Eastern Nigeria and show their sex and age variations. 2. Compare with results published elsewhere. Departmental records for oral and jaw lesions from biopsies were analysed. Sixty oral and jaw tumours were received out of a total of 4500 specimens constituting 1.3% of all biopsies. Twenty-four (40%) were males, 36 (60%) were females. The categories were calcifying odontogenic cysts and fibromas 11 (18.3%). Ameloblastomas affecting the mandible eight (13.3%). Fibrous dysplasia seven (11.7%). Invasive squamous cell carcinomas seven (11.7%). Infections with cellulites and sinusitis six (10%). Post inflammatory polyps and pseudocysts four (7%). Burkitt's Lymphomas four (7%), Haemangiomas and lymphangiomas four (7%), Soft tissue swellings from osteomyelitis three (5%). Butyroid rhabdomyosarcoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma angiofibroma, fibrous histiocytoma and fibrosarcoma were each one (1.7%). Oral and jaw tumours therefore constitute a mere 1.3% of biopsies. The most common subtype seen were the dentigerous cysts/fibromas, followed by ameloblastomas.
