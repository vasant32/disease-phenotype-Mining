The Epstein-Barr virus genome contained in the Burkitt lymphoma line Namalwa was previously localized to the short arm of chromosome 1. Analysis of a different subline of the same Namalwa line by means of Southern analysis carried out on genomic DNA, as well as in situ hybridization, showed a localization on the X chromosome.
