Using repeated computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans, we examined 8 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia during remission induction therapy between 1988 and 1989. In 3 patients, leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. In 1 patient, leukoencephalopathy was progressive and irreversible brain damage and mental retardation persisted. In the other 2 patients, hyperintense lesions in the periventricular white matter were transient and no neurologic sequelae ensued. Magnetic resonance imaging was more useful than computed tomography in the early diagnosis and management of these acute lymphocytic leukemia patients with leukoencephalopathy.
