Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nonproducer Raji cells stably maintain approximately 45 copies of the EBV genome per cell, depending on the presence of the EBV-determined nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) protein. We found that transfection of the EBV BZLF1 gene causes the disappearance of EBNA proteins on Western blots (immunoblots). On the basis of these results, we attempted to eliminate EBV plasmids in Raji cells by transfecting a BZLF1 plasmid. Among 33 clones that were cotransfected with a BZLF1 plasmid and a hygromycin B resistance plasmid and selected resistant for hygromycin B, 24 clones had decreased numbers of EBV plasmids, as revealed by the decrease in the intensity of the EBV band on Southern blots compared with that of nontransfected Raji cells.
