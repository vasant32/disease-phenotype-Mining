Human-primate hybrid cell lines were established by fusion of African green monkey kidney cells (VERO) with lymphoblastoid cells from patients with infectious mononucleosis (IM)(IMK101) and from Burkitt's lymphoma culture (HR1K). Both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific antigens and EBV particle-containing cells increased in the hybrid lines (IMK1-1/VERO,HR1K/VERO). Treatment of the hybrids with 5-bromodeoxyuridine induced more antigen-positive and more virus-containing cells. EBV could be activated from IM lymphoblastoid cells by fusion of the lymphoblastoid cells with the VERO cells. The increase of viral antigens and virus particles may have been due to the cellular interaction between VERO cells and the lymphoblastoid cells or to a possible derepressor supplied by the VERO component of the hybrid. Virus derived from the HR1K cell line was replicated in the human-primate hybrid, but further investigation may be necessary to determine if it was identical to the EBV derived from the human cell line.
