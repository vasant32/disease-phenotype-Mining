The psychologic characteristics of a patient treated of acute leukemia in the ward of bone-marrow transplantation at the Haematology Clinic of CM UJ in Cracow, have been presented. During chemotherapy, proceeding the bone marrow transplant, the patient developed an acute depressive episode with psychotic symptoms. Following the transplantation and discharge from the Haematology Clinic, due to the insufficiency of out-patient treatment and a marked increase of psychotic depression symptoms, the patient was hospitalised at the Depression-Treatment Ward of the Psychiatric Clinic of CM UJ in Cracow. Changes of intensity and character of the psychiatric disorder in the following stages of haematologic and psychiatric intervention are presented. Adaptive strategies considering the important theoretical models according to the authors in connection to the general problem of depressive disorders accompanying neoplasmatic disorders have been described.
