Analysis of EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA 1) encoding transcripts by cDNA characterization revealed a potentially polycistronic message generated by long-range splicing of several exons (Speck, S., and Strominger, J., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 8305-8309, 1985). Besides the open reading frame encoding EBNA 1, two other open reading frames are found in the EBNA 1-specific cDNA. The first reading frame consists of several exons from BamHI W and Y viral genome fragments (W1, W2, Y1, and Y2). In our experiments, the W1 exon was expressed in the tryptophan-regulated expression vector pATH11. Rabbit sera, raised against the bacterial fusion protein, recognized one or two proteins of molecular weights between 30,000 and 100,000 in several EBV genome harboring Burkitt lymphoma and EBV immortalized peripheral blood cell lines. Although, in a few cell lines from both groups no specific protein could be detected. Immunofluorescence analysis and characterization of subcellular distribution demonstrated that this W/Y fragment encoded latent protein is located, in part, in the cytoskeleton fraction, and in the chromatin. In addition, 2-D immunoblot analysis revealed post-translational modifications of this latent protein, probably due to phosphorylation. In DNA-binding studies on DNA cellulose columns, this W/Y encoded latent protein exhibited specific DNA binding activities.
