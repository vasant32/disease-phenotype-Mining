Throat washings from 26 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients from Hong Kong and Tunisia were studied for the presence of transforming EBV. Only six (23%) were found positive which led to the hypothesis of a neutralizing factor in such salivas. The search for EBV-specific antibodies showed that NPC saliva contained neutralizing VCA and EA IgA (54 and 27% respectively) and VCA and EA IgG (73 AND 54% respectively). Both transforming and non-transforming throat washings contained virus particles as visualized by electron microscopy, but in non-transforming salivas (containing IgA and IgG) the particles were found to be clumped. Comparative study of throat washings from patients with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL); infectious mononucleosis (IM), immunodeficiencies, other cancers, and healthy subjects showed that IgA were restricted to NPC cases.
