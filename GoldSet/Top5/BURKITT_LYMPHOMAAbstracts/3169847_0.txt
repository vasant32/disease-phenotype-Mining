Two subpopulations were isolated on the basis of soybean agglutinin (SBA) binding, from the human Burkitt lymphoma line Daudi. The low- and high-binder sublines maintained this characteristic in continuous passages. Their surface marker profiles, antibodies, scanning electron microscope (SEM), cytochemical reactions and binding of other lectins (concanavalin A and wheatgerm agglutinin) were not different. They differed, however, in growth potential in athymic mice. The low-binder subline had lower frequency of takes, tumor weight and volume, and did not metastasize as compared to the high-binder subline. However, the reaction with F-SBA of all the tumor cells examined was strong (greater than 70%), indicating in vivo selection and tumor development of high binder cells.
