Hodgkin's disease is a common malignancy of the lymphoid system. Although the scarce Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) tumor cells in involved tissue synthesize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and costimulatory molecules such as CD40 or CD86, it is unclear whether these tumor cells are operational antigen-presenting cells (APC). We developed an immunofluorescence-based assay to determine the number of MHC class II molecules present on the surface of single living HRS cells. We found that in fresh Hodgkin's disease lymph node biopsies, a subset of HRS cells express a substantial number of surface MHC class II molecules that are occupied by MHC class II-associated invariant chain peptides (CLIP), indicating deficient loading of MHC class II molecules with antigenic peptides. Cultured Hodgkin's disease-derived (HD) cell lines, however, were found to express few MHC class II molecules carrying CLIP peptides on the cell surface and were shown to generate sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-stable MHC class II alphabeta dimers. In addition to showing deficient MHC class II antigen presentation in a subset of HRS cells, our results show that the widely used HD-cell lines are not ideal in vitro models for the disease. The disruption of MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation in HRS cells could represent a key mechanism by which these tumor cells escape immune surveillance.
