Cytogenetic analyses were carried out in a young Haitian immigrant with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and concomitant Burkitt's-like lymphoma associated with massive bone marrow infiltration. A characteristic 14q+ abnormality was found in all bone marrow cells examined. Although chromosome abnormality involving band 8q24 was not evident in all the cells examined, some karyotypes show that the typical t(8;14)(q24;q32) is most probably present. No other complex rearrangements could be identified. This is the first report of concomitant acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Burkitt's-like lymphoma in the Haitian community. Our cytogenetic findings provide further evidence for the role of specific chromosomal rearrangements in Burkitt's-like lymphoma oncogenesis in the setting of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
