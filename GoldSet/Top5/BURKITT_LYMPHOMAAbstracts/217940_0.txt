Conjugated estrogens were studied for mutagenicity (and implied carcinogenicity) in two strains of S. typhimurium, two normal and three neoplastic human lymphoid cell lines (the latter from Burkitt's lymphoma patients) in cell culture and a Chinese hamster cell line in diffusion chambers implanted into mice. No significant increase in mutation rate or chromosome aberrations were noticed after exposure to conjugated estrogens.
