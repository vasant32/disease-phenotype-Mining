We report the establishment and characterization, including HLA-typing, immunophenotypic and molecular cytogenetic analysis, of a novel EBV-negative cell line (BLUE-1) derived from adult relapsed sporadic Burkitt lymphoma. BLUE-1 carries the pathognomonic t(8;14)(q24;q32) effecting MYC/IgHJ fusion and a novel t(6;20)(q15;q11.2) originally present in the patient, analysis of which may facilitate identification of gene target(s) of recurrent 6q rearrangements in B-cell neoplasia. Our findings are discussed in light of the current understanding of endemic and sporadic Burkitt lymphoma. BLUE-1 grows well in culture and should be a useful lymphoma research tool.
