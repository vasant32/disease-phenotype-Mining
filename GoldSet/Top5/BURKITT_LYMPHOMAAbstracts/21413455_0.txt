Formation of epithelioid histiocytic cell granulomas has been described in the post in various neoplasms, hematologic malignancies included. Among lymphoproliferative disorders such changes are commonly found in Hodgkin lymphoma and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), but are rarely described in B-NHL, like Burkitt lymphoma. This report presents a case of sporadic Burkitt lymphoma accompanied by a sarcoid-like reaction without any clinical, laboratory or histological evidence of microorganisms nor sarcoidosis. Using in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction the presence of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected in the analyzed lymphoma cells. EBV demonstrated latency I phenotype as defined by the lack of immunohistochemical positivity of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). Cytogenetic investigation using fluorescence in situ hybridization uncovered c-MYC mutation and provided indirect indication for the MYC/IgL fusion gene. The lack of EBV positivity in histiocytes indicated the reactive character of the granulomatous reaction in relation to the neoplasm. The role of the granulomatous reaction in the biology and prognosis of Burkitt lymphoma and the function of EBV infection in its development remain to be established.
