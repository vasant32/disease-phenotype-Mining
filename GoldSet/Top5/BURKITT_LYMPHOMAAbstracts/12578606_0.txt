p73 has high homology with the classical tumor suppressor gene p53. When overexpressed, p73 could lead to tumor cells growth arrest and induce apoptosis. Lost of p73 gene expression due to hypermethylation was found in about one third patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Burkitt's lymphoma, but the expression level of p73 was higher in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia than that in normal white blood cells. Further research will be necessary to find out the role of p73 in leukemogensis.
