The aim of this study was to clarify whether bortezomib might induce apoptosis in Burkitt's lymphoma Raji cell line and its mechanism. Different concentrations of bortezomib were used to treat Raji cells and its effects of time and dose were observed. Cell morphology was observed under light microscope; flow cytometry was used to analyze cell apoptosis; RT-PCR was used to detect the expressions of NF-kappaB and p53 gene mRNAs. The results showed that the bortezomib could inhibit Raji cell growth within a certain range of treating time and dose. Apoptosis were induced in relation to time and dose. The expression of NF-kappaB mRNA and p53 mRNA decreased after treatment with bortezomib. It is concluded that the bortezomib can induce Raji cell apoptosis, which provides a theoretical basis for clinical treatment. NF-kappaB and p53 gene are supposed to participate in the bortezomib induced apoptosis of Raji cells.
