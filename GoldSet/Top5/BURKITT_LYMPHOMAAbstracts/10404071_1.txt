We generated a monoclonal antibody (MAb), H8.98, that recognizes an antigen shared by 50% of examined renal carcinoma cell (RCC) lines and is susceptible to lysis by a Vgamma3Vdelta1(+) T-cell clone derived from RCC tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. H8.98 inhibited Vgamma3Vdelta1(+ )T-cell clone-mediated lysis of RCC lines. It did not stain normal kidney lines, melanomas, fibroblasts, Burkitt's lymphoma or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines but it did stain 2 of 4 tested breast cancer lines. Through screening of a renal carcinoma cDNA library using H8.98, we isolated a cDNA clone which, upon sequencing, was found to be cytochrome b with 2 point mutations.
