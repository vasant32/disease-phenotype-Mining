Grey zone lymphomas are lymphatic tumors that cannot be assigned to a defined lymphoma entity due to morphological, clinical or genetic reasons. As a defining criterion they present with features of two overlapping entities or features that are intermediate. Such lymphomas may represent a grey zone in the differentiation between indolent and aggressive lymphomas. Often they may show morphological features of one entity but be more related to another entity with respect to the immunophenotype and/or genetic constitution, such as lymphomas in the grey zone between primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma and primary nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The B-cell lymphoma, unclassified, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma has recently been recognized as a provisional category in the updated WHO 2008 classification of malignant lymphomas. This corresponds to a practical lymphoma category that obviously contains several entities with a Burkitt-like appearance and aggressive clinical behavior. Genetically, tumors in this category are frequently characterized by an atypical MYC translocation and complex karyotypic alterations. As yet, no adequate therapy concept exists.
