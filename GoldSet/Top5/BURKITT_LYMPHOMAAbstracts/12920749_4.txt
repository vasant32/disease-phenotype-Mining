 OBJECTIVE: To compare the cytologic features of histologically proven lymphocytic (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroitidis) and primary thyroid lymphomas (TL). STUDY DESIGN: Clinical histories, smears (stained with Diff-Quik, Papanicolaou stain or hematoxylin and eosin [HE]) and surgical specimens (HE slides) were reviewed in 25 cases of lymphocytic thyroiditis and 12 of thyroid lymphomas. RESULTS: Surgical specimens of thyroiditis were obtained for other medical reasons: goiter and compressive symptomatology in 21 cases and neoplasms in 4 (2 papillary carcinomas, 1 follicular carcinoma and 1 oncocytic adenoma). Seven cases were primary lymphomas, and 5 were secondary. Histologically there were 6 large B-cell lymphomas, 2 mantle cell lymphomas, 1 Burkitt lymphoma, 2 mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas in blastic transformation and 1 of unknown type. Sensitivity for the diagnosis was 67.5% for HT and 92.3% for lymphoma. CONCLUSION: A heterogeneous population of small and large lymphocytes was the most frequent pattern in both diseases. The presence of a monotonous population of large lymphocytes or, more rarely, of small cells indicates a probable TL. Plasma cells favor HT. Other techniques are mandatory for the differentiation of cases with inconclusive diagnoses.
