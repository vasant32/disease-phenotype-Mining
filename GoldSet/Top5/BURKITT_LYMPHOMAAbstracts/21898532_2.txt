There have been several attempts to improve treatment and outcome of patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). In recent years, chemotherapy dose intensification and the addition of rituximab have led to a remarkable progress and have developed into integral parts of treatment for both entities of lymphoma [1â€“4]. Here, we report our monocenter results of a high-dose methotrexate based alternating regimen with rituximab (B-ALL/NHL 2002 protocol) in 15 patients with PMBL and 28 patients with sporadic BL. Since the early 1980s, protocols of GMALL have been continuously adapted and in the meantime they have become reference treatment for BL and B-ALL in Germany. The latest changes comprised the additional use of rituximab, standardized G-CSF support,implementation of high-dose cytarabine, intrathecal triple therapy,and age-adjusted stratification. Furthermore, we additionally amended supportive care with palifermin as it reduced severity and prevalence of mucositis [5].
