A primary Burkitt-type lymphoma of the CNS was reported which developed in an 11-year-old boy 6 months after extirpation of an astrocytoma. Primary Burkitt-type lymphomas have been described only twice in the literature. The morphological aspect is interesting with regard to the problem of collision tumors.
