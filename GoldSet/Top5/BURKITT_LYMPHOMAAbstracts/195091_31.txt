This paper reports a unique type of interaction of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with an EBV receptor-positive, genome-negative human lymphoid T cell line (Molt 4), which can be summarized as follows. Although Molt 4 cells express receptors for EBV, they appear to block the penetration of this virus. These observations are derived from combined studies with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. It is possible that T cell lines bearing receptors for EBV may express such a control on virus penetration.
