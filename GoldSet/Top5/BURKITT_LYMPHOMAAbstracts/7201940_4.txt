The effects of H--Y antigen, released in a soluble state by male human Burkitt lymphomas and mouse teratomas, were studied in the fetal gonads from 13 to 21-day-old rats and 98-day-old calves, using histologic techniques, radioimmunoassays for testosterone, and bioassays for MÃ¼llerian-inhibiting substance (MIS). Whereas no effect was detected in the younger gonads, some structural changes were observed in bovine and 21-day-old rat ovaries when cultured for 5 days with Daudi and male teratoma supernatants, but there was no synthesis of testosterone or MIS. These observations raise questions concerning the critical period of sensitivity to H--Y antigen of female gonads, and the dissociation between morphologic and biochemical events.
