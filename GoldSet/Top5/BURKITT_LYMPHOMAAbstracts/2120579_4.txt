The Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Ly66 produces a short mu chain which lacks 4 kDa in apparent molecular mass. Study of the corresponding messenger RNA showed it to be 0.3 kb shorter than normal mu transcripts. The cDNA sequence of the mu transcripts began by a short VH region consisting of the first one-third of a VHIV subgroup gene segment. It was followed by a normal mu constant region. This VH region coded for 38 amino acids, thus differing from two truncated VHIV regions previously reported in other Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, which were interrupted at codon +26 by an alternate splicing event. In addition, the Ly66 variable sequence bore several point mutations and contained two potential N-glycosylation sites.
