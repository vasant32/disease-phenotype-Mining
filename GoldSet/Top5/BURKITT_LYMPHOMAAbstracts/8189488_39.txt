The Epstein-Barr virus in the Burkitt lymphoma-derived cell line Raji has a deletion in the EBNA3C gene. When Raji cells are allowed to grow to high density and most of the cells become growth arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, the level of detectable latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is substantially reduced. After dilution of the cells with fresh growth medium, within 8 h, there is a large increase in LMP1 mRNA, and by 12 h, LMP1 is expressed to a high level (H. Boos, M. Stoehr, M. Sauter, and N. Mueller-Lantzch, J. Gen. Virol. 71:1811-1815, 1990). Here we show that in Raji cells which constitutively express a transfected EBNA3C gene, the down-regulation of LMP1 in growth-arrested cells does not take place. Furthermore, we show that in wild-type Raji cells, low-level LMP1 expression occurs when most of the cells are arrested at a point(s) early in G1 (or G0) when the product of the retinoblastoma gene, pRb, is hypophosphorylated. The dramatic synthesis of LMP1 coincides with the progression of these cells to late G1 when pRb becomes hyperphosphorylated. Thus, in Raji cells, the LMP1 gene is apparently regulated in a cell cycle- or proliferation-dependent manner, but when EBNA3C is present, sustained LMP1 expression occurs as it does in a lymphoblastoid cell line. EBNA3C appears to either relieve the apparent repression of LMP1 in cells progressing through early G1 or possibly alter the stage at which the cells growth arrest to one where they are permissive for LMP1 expression.
