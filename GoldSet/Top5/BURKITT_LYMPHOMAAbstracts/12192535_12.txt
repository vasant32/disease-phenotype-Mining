Tumor growth depends upon an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients achieved through angiogenesis and maintenance of an intact tumor vasculature. Therapy with individual agents that target new vessel formation or existing vessels has suppressed experimental tumor growth, but rarely resulted in the eradication of tumors. We therefore tested the combined anti-tumor activity of vasostatin and interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), agents that differently target the tumor vasculature. Vasostatin, a selective and direct inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation, significantly reduced Burkitt tumor growth and tumor vessel density. IP-10, an "angiotoxic" chemokine, caused vascular damage and focal necrosis in Burkitt tumors. When combined, vasostatin plus IP-10 reduced tumor growth more effectively than each agent alone, but complete tumor regression was not observed. Microscopically, these tumors displayed focal necrosis and reduction in vessel density. Combination therapy with the inhibitors of angiogenesis vasostatin and IP-10 is effective in reducing the rate of tumor growth but fails to induce tumor regression, suggesting that curative treatment may require supplemental drugs targeting directly the tumor cells.
