Primary pancreatic lymphoma (PPL) is a rare form of extranodal lymphoma. So far, only in adults has a coincidence with diabetes mellitus (DM) been described. We report a nearly 9-year-old German boy presenting with a Burkitt lymphoma associated with a temporary insulin-dependent DM and exocrine insufficiency of the pancreas. After the patient went into remission, a spontaneous recovery of the endocrine pancreatic function was observed. On immunophenotyping, the lymphoma cells revealed expression of FasL suggesting a potentially apoptotic effect on pancreatic tissue. Beta cell impairment may have been caused by FasL resembling autoimmune diabetes.
