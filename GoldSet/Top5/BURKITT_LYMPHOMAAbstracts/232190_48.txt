RNA was extracted from the Burkitt lymphoma-derived cell line Raji and from Burkitt lymphoma tumor biopsies, isotope labeled in vitro by iodination with 125I, and hybridized to electrophoretically separated restriction endonuclease fragments of Epstein-Barr virus DNA on nitrocellulose membranes. The results indicated that only certain parts of the Epstein-Barr virus genome are represented as polyribosomal RNA in Raji cells, with a pronounced dominance of RNA sequences complementary to a 2.0 x 10(6)-dalton segment of Epstein-Barr virus DNA located close to the left end of the viral genome. A map of virus-specific polyribosomal RNA sequences was constructed, which indicated that a minimum of three regions of the Epstein-Barr virus genome are expressed in Raji cells. Total-cell RNA preparations from five Burkitt lymphoma biopsies contained RNA sequences homologous to the same regions of Epstein-Barr virus DNA as polyribosomal RNA from Raji cells, albeit at different relative proportions.
