Burkitt-lymphoma is a rare disease, that belongs to the aggressive Non-Hodgkin-lymphomas. Next to histology, that shows a characteristic pattern, and immunophenotyping additional cytogenetic and molecular biology techniques are used to demonstrate in most cases a translocation of the oncogen c-myc on chromosome 8 to any of the immunoglobulin genes on chromosome 14, 2 or 22. With short term intensive chemotherapies a cure rate of 85-95% of patients with Burkitt-lymphoma can be obtained today.
