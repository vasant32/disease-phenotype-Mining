A 10-year-old boy was referred to our clinic for tonsillectomy and was found to have a large mass within his oropharynx. Intraoperative biopsies confirmed Burkitt lymphoma. Further imaging and biopsy revealed pancreatic involvement. He was treated with multiagent chemotherapy. He remains disease-free 6 years later. Review of the literature demonstrates other cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with pancreatic involvement with good outcomes. Pancreatic involvement is a relatively rare occurrence in childhood lymphoma.
