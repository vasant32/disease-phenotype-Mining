Four cases of lymphosarcomata are described in which the histological pattern was identical to that seen in Burkitt's lymphoma. The anatomical distribution was dissimilar in that the disease predominantly affected the reticulo-endothelial system. The arrangement of the histiocytes and lymphoid cells in these tumour groups is similar to that of macrophages and lymphocytes in rosettes seen in leucocyte cultures under certain conditions, and it is suggested that an immunological factor may be responsible for these appearances.
