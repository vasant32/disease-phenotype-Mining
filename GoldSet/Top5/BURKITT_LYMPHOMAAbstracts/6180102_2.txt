The P3 HR-1 cell line was studied with respect to sensitivity to the growth inhibitory properties of Hu IFN-alpha (leukocyte interferon). Cells growth arrested at high density and diluted into fresh medium, were growth inhibited at the same time and to the same degree as exponentially growing cells. Thus, resting cells did not seem to be more sensitive to IFN than exponentially growing cells. The cells displayed the same sensitivity to IFN during all cell cycle phases and they were found to enter the G0 stage in a dose dependent manner following first order kinetics.
