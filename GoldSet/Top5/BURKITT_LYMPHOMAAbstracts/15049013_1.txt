 BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to evaluate the significance of serum level of immunoglobulins (Igs) and particularly IgG for leukemic cell persistence in peripheral blood (PB) and prognosis for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURE: Human sera were obtained from 68 children with primary B-lineage ALL at diagnosis and 46 healthy children (control). Serum level of IgM, IgG, IgA, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, antitumor antibody, homogeneous IgG were quantified by turbidimetric or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: The mean values of serum IgM, IgG, IgA at diagnosis were not differed significantly in ALL patients and control children. The level of IgM and IgG1 inversely correlated with white blood cell (WBC) count in PB of patients. Normal range of serum IgG, separated by 25th and 75th percentiles of IgG variables, was associated in patients with decreased WBC count in PB but not in bone marrow (BM) versus patients with low concentration of IgG. Normal range of IgG also favors low frequency of homogeneous IgG and antitumor antibodies. Patients with high level of IgG, besides increased frequency of homogeneous IgG and antitumor antibodies, had worse 3-year overall survival (OS) rate as compared to patients with normal level of IgG (58.8 vs. 91.2%, P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: The normal level of serum IgG at diagnosis is a beneficial prognostic factor associated with lower rate of leukemic cell persistence in PB and better outcome of childhood B-lineage ALL.
