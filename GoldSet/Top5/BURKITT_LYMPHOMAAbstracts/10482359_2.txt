In this study we compare the binding and immune stimulatory properties of BAT and anti CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Both antibodies were previously shown to manifest effective immune responses against tumor cells. We have described that BAT antibody, produced against Daudi, a B lymphoblastoid cell line, binds and activates T cells. In this paper we demonstrate that anti CTLA-4, produced against the T-cell activation determinant CTLA-4, binds also to B lymphoblastoid cell lines like Daudi and Raji. Both antibodies do not bind resting B cells. BAT binds resting T lymphocytes as well as activated T lymphocytes, whereas anti CTLA-4 binds only activated T cells. Competitive binding experiments indicate that the binding sites of BAT and anti CTLA-4 on activated T cells are distinct. We have studied the in vitro stimulatory effect of BAT and anti CTLA-4 on lymphocytes cultured with or without tumor cells. In contrast to BAT that increased the proliferation of lymphocytes that have been cultured with tumor cells, anti CTLA-4 did not synergize with tumor cells to enhance lymphocyte proliferation.
