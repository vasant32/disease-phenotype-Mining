Three cases of malignant lymphoma of the breast are described, seen over a 14 year period in the district of Kuopio University Central Hospital. The neoplasms were either of high or intermediate grade of malignancy: one immunoblastic, one Burkitt-type, and one centroblastic-centrocytic malignant lymphoma. The patient with centroblastic-centrocytic malignant lymphoma had advanced disease with pulmonary and adenoidal involvement and died 15 months after the detection of the breast tumor. The two other neoplasms were confined to the breast with no evidence of further dissemination. The patient with immunoblastic malignant lymphoma developed intestinal lymphoma 3 years later which was treated with surgery and cytostatic therapy. The patient has since been in remission for a period of 10.5 years. The patient with Burkitt-type malignant lymphoma was subjected to surgical resection which was followed by cytostatic treatment. The patient has remained in good health during the 20-month follow-up. The correct diagnosis is especially important in breast lymphoma because without it the appropriate treatment cannot be applied.
