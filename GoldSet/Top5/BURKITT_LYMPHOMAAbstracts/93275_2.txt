Pathologic diagnosis of malignant lymphoma, Burkitt type, was made in a 12 year old child with an abdominal tumour. The association of this lymphoma with Epstein-Barr virus was done based on the detection of Epstein-Barr viral markers within the tumour cells, as well as on the patient's serology. To our knowledge, it is the first time that the association between Burkitt's lymphoma and Epstein-Barr virus, which is frequent in Africa, is reported in a Caucasian French.
