We present herein the first evidence that human C3 and, with a higher efficiency, trypsin-cleaved C3 enhanced in vitro phosphorylation of a cellular component, characterized by an apparent molecular weight of 105 kDa, pp105, present in the human B lymphoma cells, Raji. This regulatory activity was associated with C3d fragment generated in trypsin-cleaved C3. A 16 amino-acid peptide, carrying the LYNVEA sequence of C3d reacting with the C3d receptor (CR2), was synthetized. P16 enhanced, in a dose-dependent curve between 0.3 to 10 microM, in vitro phosphorylation of pp105, as well as C3d fragments present in trypsin-cleaved C3. A fibrinogen-related synthetic peptide of 15 amino acids, used as control, had no effect on pp105 phosphorylation. P16 and trypsin-cleaved C3 regulate pp105 phosphorylation through identical pathways. Thus, p16 represents the 16 amino-acid sequence of C3 which regulated in vitro phosphorylation of pp105.
