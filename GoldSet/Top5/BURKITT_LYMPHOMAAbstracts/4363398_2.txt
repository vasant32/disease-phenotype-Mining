The relative value of heterophil agglutinins (HA) and of specific EBV antibodies in the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis (IM) was assessed in 108 cases of the disease and in 280 controls. Among the 108 cases 93 were HA-positive by sheep cells in at least one of their sera, while 15 were HA-negative by the same test. Among the 280 controls false-positive HA tests were not encountered except in eight cases with the horse cell microtitre tests. With one of the two slide tests at least two false-positive tests and 12 false-negative tests were also found but these sera had low titres in microtitre tests. The HA life-span was found to be unexpectedly long in a few cases, sheep cell HA lasting up to 8 to 10 months and horse cell HA up to 21 to 23 months.Many false-positive tests may therefore not be true false-positives and may result from the persistence of HA following unrecognized mononucleosis months before. Virtually all cases of IM had (or developed) antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus, viral capsid antigen (EBV-VCA), whereas only half of the controls were EBV-VCA-positive. The comparative analysis of nonspecific and specific test results in mononucleosis allows the following conclusions: (1) horse cell microtitre tests and the monospot test are more sensitive than sheep cell microtitre tests and the monotest; (2) false-negative results are occasionally seen with the latter tests but not with the former; (3) more false-positive results, however, are probably seen with the former tests; and (4) specific EBV-IgM and EBV-EA antibody tests are useful in the diagnosis of selected borderline cases of mononucleosis.
