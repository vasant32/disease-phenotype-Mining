Burkitt's lymphoma is an uncommon form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults. The diagnostic workup for Burkitt's lymphoma includes radiological imaging and like any other form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma definitive diagnosis is by histopathology. Imaging is necessary to determine the distribution and severity in terms of extent and organs of involvement to further assist in staging and thence to implement appropriate therapy. High incidence of intraabdominal involvement is seen in American Burkitt lymphoma.
