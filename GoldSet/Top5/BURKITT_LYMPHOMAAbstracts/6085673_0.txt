The factor that determines the antigenic type of IFN produced in human lymphoblastoid cell lines was examined using live Sendai virus, ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated virus, HANA spikes exposed on L cells persistently infected with Sendai virus (L-HVJ) and poly-inosinic acid poly-cytidylic acid (poly I: C). When Sendai virus was irradiated with UV-light for 300 sec, its abilities to infect chicken eggs and induce IFN were diminished, but its HA activity was unaffected. HANA spikes exposed on L-HVJ could not induce IFN in human lymphoblastoid cell lines, although they induced IFN in mouse spleen cells. These results suggest that the induction of IFN in human lymphoblastoid cells is closely related to viral nucleic acid. Poly I: C also induced IFN in some human lymphoblastoid cell lines in which IFN production is induced by Sendai virus. The antigenic types of IFN induced by poly I: C were the same as those induced by Sendai virus. These results suggest that the antigenic type of IFN produced depends on the nature of the IFN producer cells rather than on the kind of IFN inducer.
