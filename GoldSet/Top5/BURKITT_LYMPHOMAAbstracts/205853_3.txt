The inoculation of a cotton-topped marmoset with B95-8 strain of EBV resulted in the induction of a multifocal lymphoma and lymphoblastoid cell lines were established from liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph node tumors. The cell lines were remarkably similar to each other with respect to the presence of EBV and its expression, the surface properties of the cells and their stability, and the functional products of the cells. Karyotypic examination of the cell lines revealed the common loss of a single chromosome. The slight differences noted in karyotypes suggest some divergence from a tumor stem cell and imply a clonal origin. Thus, EBV-induced lymphomas in cotton-topped marmosets resemble Burkitt's lymphoma in man.
