Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked combined immunodeficiency affecting cells of several different hemopoietic lineages. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), which has no homology with any other known protein families, is rich in proline motifs known to contribute to Src homology 3 binding sites. However, its function has not been determined. The Tec family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, which include Btk (the X-linked agammaglobulinemia gene), Itk, and Tec, is thought to be involved in lymphoid cell signaling pathways. In this work, we show binding of WASP to the Src homology 3 domains of Btk, Itk, Tec, Grb2, and phospholipase C-gamma, which suggests a function for WASP in lymphoid cell signaling.
