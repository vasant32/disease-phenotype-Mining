INTRODUCTION: Neoplasia and lymphoproliferative disorders are sometimes reported in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the pathophysiological link between lymphoma and SLE is still a matter of debate. We report a new case of Burkitt's lymphoma occurring in a patient treated with immunosuppressive drugs for SLE. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old woman with SLE treated for 10 years with immunosuppressive drugs was admitted for the rapid onset of multiple neuritis with cranial nerves palsy, without extra-neurological involvement. The cerebrospinal fluid was normal. A bone marrow biopsy revealed Burkitt's lymphoma. CONCLUSION: This is the third case reported of Burkitt's lymphoma occurring in SLE. Here we discuss the data of the literature and the possible pathophysiological links between Burkitt's lymphoma and SLE.
