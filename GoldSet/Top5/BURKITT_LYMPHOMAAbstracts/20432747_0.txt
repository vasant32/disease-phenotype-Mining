Lymphomas represent the third most common group of cancers in childhood and adolescence, mature B non Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) accounting for up to 60% of newly diagnosed patients. The diagnosis of specific entities of B-NHL is based on well-defined morphologic analysis, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics and molecular genetics, which determine the optimal treatment strategy. In adult population a major turning point in treatment of B-NHL has been achieved since rituximab, in combination with CHOP has improved the survival rate up to 19%. Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets CD20, a transmembrane calcium channel expressed on normal and malignant B-cells that mediates cytotoxic, apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects. The effect of rituximab in pediatric population is still not well enough investigated. Based on morphology and immunophenotype of malignant cells, seven children with B-NHL in our institution were eligible for treatment with modified B-NHL-Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster (BFM)-95-based protocol with rituximab administered on day -5. The complete remission was achieved in all seven patients. Six patients are still in complete remission at least 12 months after having finished chemotherapy and one patient relapsed two months after the last cycle and subsequently died. Major adverse effects observed during treatment were prolonged B-cell depletion and myelosuppression. Rituximab in combination with B-NHL-BFM-95 protocol was otherwise well tolerated and proved to be effective in children and adolescents with B-NHL. The number of our patients is too small and the follow-up of a larger group of patients will help in defining the role of rituximab in the treatment of childhood B-NHL.
