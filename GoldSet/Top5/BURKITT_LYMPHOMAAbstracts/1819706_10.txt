The role of paf-acether (paf), a phospholipid cytokine, in the modulation of human B cell function was investigated. Paf, from 1 x 10(-5) M to 10(-6) M, decreased B cell proliferation induced by both phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and anti-IgM antibodies (anti-IgM Ab). By contrast, 1 x 10(-7) M to 1 x 10(-9) M paf enhanced PMA triggered, but not anti-IgM triggered B cell proliferation. B cell proliferation was modulated between 24 and 72 hr of culture indicating that the effect of paf did not merely reflect a shift in proliferation kinetics. Interestingly, paf also enhanced the spontaneous proliferation of a Burkitt lymphoma-derived B cell line, Raji, which suggests that paf can directly act on B cells. The modulatory effect of paf on peripheral blood B cells was independent of PMA concentration, yet the effect on Raji cells was dependent upon cell density. The data suggest that paf is a potent modulator of B cell function, and may be involved in the control of humoral immune response.
