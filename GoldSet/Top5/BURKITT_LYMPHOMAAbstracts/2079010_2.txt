Patients infected with the HIV virus have been reported to develop several malignant neoplasms, the most frequent of which is Kaposi's sarcoma. Although an increasing number of lymphomas, primarily non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, have been described who are HIV seropositive, few cases of Burkitt's lymphoma have been reported in patients. We report a case of an HIV-seropositive man who had paranasal sinus Burkitt's lymphoma underlying chronic maxillary sinusitis. Successful remission was achieved with chemotherapy.
