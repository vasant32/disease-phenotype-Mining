Human gamma delta T cells of peripheral blood can be divided in two groups in terms of their TCR as well as their behavior upon in vitro stimulation. The major subset expresses the TCR V-segments V gamma 9 and V delta 2 and proliferates in response to ligands revealed by various microorganisms, and the cell line Daudi in addition. The minor group is less homogenous on the gamma-chain but is almost completely identified by mAb against the V delta 1 segment; there is no ligand known to promote growth of these cells. Here we demonstrate that gamma delta T cells out of this subgroup are strongly stimulated in vitro by cells from several Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. EBV infection of the Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines enhanced the stimulatory ability towards the T cells. Although EBV infection influenced the expression of a variety of cell surface molecules including ICAM-1 and LFA-3, no correlation to the gamma delta T cell-stimulating capacity became apparent. We conclude that Burkitt's lymphoma cells and transformed B cells express ligands of cellular origin for a hitherto poorly characterized subgroup of human gamma delta T cells.
