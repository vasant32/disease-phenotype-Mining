Antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded membrane proteins, LMP2A and LMP2B, were assayed in 540 individuals, including 154 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, 16 with African Burkitt's lymphoma, 113 with Hodgkin's disease, 14 with EBV-carrying gastric carcinoma, 14 with oral hairy leucoplakia (HIV+ patients), 37 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 49 with tumours of the head/neck, 19 with infectious mononucleosis, 62 with chronic illnesses with EBV titres consistent with re-activations, and 62 healthy controls. A novel assay, mouse monoclonal enhanced indirect immunofluorescence assay (MIFA) was designed and used to test the sera for antibodies to the LMP2A and 2B proteins, expressed in human keratinocytes. Antibody to both LMP2A and LMP2B was strikingly specific to NPC. Virtually all (99 of 101) of the LMP2 antibody positive individuals were NPC patients, 95% of whom had antibodies that reacted both with the LMP2A- and LMP2B-transfected indicator cells, while the remaining 5% reacted only with the LMP2B expressing cells.
