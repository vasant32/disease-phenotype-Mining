The original metal-salt technique of Gomori (1948a) employing p-chloranilidophosphonic acid as a substrate for the demonstration of the activity of phosphoamidase has been used with varying success by a number of investigators for light microscopy. Cyclophosphamide (endoxan) which is a cytotoxic drug known to activate phosphoamidase and other lysosomal enzymes in neoplasm (Grillo, 1971) is proposed as another substrate for the enzyme for both light and electron microscopy.
