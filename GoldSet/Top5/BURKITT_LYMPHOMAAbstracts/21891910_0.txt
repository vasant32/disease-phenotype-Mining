Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is the most common childhood cancer in Africa and is most prevalent in areas endemic for malaria. The disease, a malignant growth of lymphoid tissue, usually presents itself as a large tumor of the jaw. It is however, a rarity in the Indian subcontinent. Through an extensive literary survey, it is seen that only a few cases of BL have been reported, accounting for only 0.76% of solid malignant tumors among Indian children. Here we present a case of BL of mandible extending to maxilla in a 13-year-old boy of Indian origin.
