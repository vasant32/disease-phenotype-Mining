In this study, we showed that the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-mediated apoptosis of Burkitt's lymphoma BL41 cells is dependent on the BH3-only protein Bim. In contrast to what has been observed with other cell types, TGFbeta activation did not promote Bim upregulation in BL41 cells, but instead resulted in Bim release from the mitochondria. Indeed, Bim levels were high in healthy BL41 cells, in which they dimerized with the Bcl-2-like protein Mcl-1 at the mitochondrial surface. In healthy and TGFbeta-activated BL41 cells, unlike in epithelial cells or hepatocytes, Bim did not associate with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. TGFbeta activation of BL41 cells triggered the p38-dependent activation of caspase-8, causing the cleavage of Mcl-1 and the transfer of Bim from the mitochondria to the cytoskeleton. In addition to mitochondrial activation, this relocation of Bim may facilitate the complete demise of a cell death that is beyond the commitment point to apoptosis and may represent a hallmark of the TGFbeta-mediated apoptosis of human lymphoma B cells.
