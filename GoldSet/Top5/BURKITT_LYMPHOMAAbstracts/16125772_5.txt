ATM promoter hypermethylation has been recently reported in adult carcinomas, but no information is available concerning the methylation status of ATM gene promoter in childhood B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Furthermore, involvement of somatic ATM promoter mutations in cancer is not known. We report a complete ATM gene promoter analysis in 74 childhood lymphoid malignancies.
