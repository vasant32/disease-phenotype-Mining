Morbidity and mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies are significantly increased by development of acute renal failure. This is more likely in the developing world where facilities for renal replacement therapy are scarce. This review discusses the pathophysiology of acute renal failure due to tumor lysis syndrome in patients with Burkitt's lymphoma, the commonest hematological malignancy in the pediatric age group in sub-Saharan Africa, and evaluates the possible management options. Tumor lysis can also develop in association with other hematologic malignancies, both spontaneously and following treatment, and these principles are applicable in all such cases.
