A factor on human lymphocytes has been identified as factor B of the alternative pathway. Lymphocytes can replace factor B in the fluid phase formation of C3 convertase with cobra venom factor (CVF). This lymphocyte activity is inhibited by specific anti-human factor B, and it is shown by Burkitt lymphoma cell lines cultured in the absence of any factor B source. After the reaction with CVF all the C3-converting activity is found in the cell supernatant, and the same cells can undergo several successive cycles of 'activation' by CVF. Factor B is distinct from the C3b receptor, and its presence could not be detected antigenically on the lymphocyte membrane. It may be secreted by the cells, but the reaction was not affected by sodium azide or cytochalasin B. No detectable factor B activity was found in the culture medium of cells grown in the absence of CVF.
