A new Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) negative cell line SKW 4 has been established in vitro from a patient with diffuse histiocytic lymphoma. The SKW 4 seems to be an authentic human tumour cell line as evidenced by its EBV negativity, monoclonality and aneuploidy tested during early in vitro passage. The cell line expresses surface mu and kappa-chains, HLA-DR antigen, C3 and Fc receptors and B-cell lineage antigens. The karyotypic analyses demonstrated many numerical and structural aberrations. No Burkitt lymphoma associated translocations (t8;14, t2;8, t;22) were detected, but most of the markers found are those commonly associated with various types of human cancer. The SKW 4 thus represents the most common type of 'histiocytic lymphoma', that with a B-lymphoid cell phenotype, but is unique among HL derived lymphoma lines in its strong expression of a Helix pomatia A agglutinin binding surface glycoprotein of an apparent molecular weight of 75 000 daltons.
