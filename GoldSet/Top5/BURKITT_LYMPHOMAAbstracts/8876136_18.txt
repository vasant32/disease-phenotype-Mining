Basic research in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) molecular genetics has provided means to maintain episomes in human cells, to efficiently deliver episomes with up to 150 kbp of heterologous DNA to human B lymphocytes, and to immortalize human B lymphocytes with EBV recombinants that can maintain up to 120 kbp of heterologous DNA. Episome maintenance requires an EBV nuclear protein, EBNA1, whereas immortalization of cells with EBV recombinants requires EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3C, EBNALP, and LMP1. EBV-derived vectors are useful for experimental genetic reconstitution in B lymphocytes, a cell type frequently used in establishing repositories of human genetic deficiencies. The ability of EBV-infected cells to establish a balanced state of persistence in normal humans raises the possibility that cells infected with EBV recombinants could be useful for genetic reconstitution, in vivo.
