We reviewed the pattern of acute neurotoxicity in children with B-non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) and B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated with the UKCCSG 9002/9003 protocols. Among 175 patients, 21 (12%) developed acute neurotoxicity: 9002 protocol (n=11/112) and 9003 (n=10/63). There were 20 boys and the median age was 10 years. Patients with neurological symptoms due to other causes were excluded. Acute neurological symptoms developed following induction chemotherapy in 7 patients, or after a more intensive course of chemotherapy containing high-dose methotrexate (n=14). Nine patients required their chemotherapy to be altered because of the acute neurotoxicity. One patient died of cerebral haemorrhage but none of the remaining six deaths was attributed to acute neurotoxicity. We conclude that acute neurotoxicity is common in children treated with the 9002/9003 protocols and tends to be transient. Intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy including high-dose methotrexate is probably the most common predisposing factor. Modification of subsequent chemotherapy is not invariably necessary.
