This paper describes a doughnut-like ultrasound (US) finding in pediatric intestinal Burkitt's lymphoma. A 9-year-old boy had a fist-sized, hard, non-movable mass in the lower abdomen. US showed a thickened, layered ring like a doughnut. The outer, low-level echoes seemed to be consistent with mucosa and muscle layers and the inner, high-level echoes seemed to be intraluminal air or mucus. The serum lactic dehydrogenase level was high. At surgery, a solid, hard tumor 15 x 10 cm in size was found in the jejunum. The intestinal wall was diffusely thickened with an intact mucosa. From this experience, the US doughnut sign may be a helpful diagnostic finding in pediatric intestinal Burkitt's lymphoma.
