Previous studies have shown that Raji, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized Burkitt lymphoma B cell line, contains functional platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptors. Twelve other lymphoid cell lines, including Burkitt and non-Burkitt B cell lines, T cell lines, and a non B, non T cell line were tested for the presence of PAF receptors. Radioligand binding studies conducted at 4 degrees C revealed that six lymphoid cell lines of B cell origin (Raji, P3HR-1, BJAB, BJA/HR-1, Dakiki and PB-1) could specifically bind [3H]PAF. Treatment of four (Raji, P3HR-1, Dakiki and PB-1) of the above lymphoid cell lines with PAF resulted in an increase in free intracellular calcium, indicating that these specific PAF binding sites were functional PAF receptors. Other B cell lines (Daudi, B95-8, sfBT, CB-1), T cell lines (MOLT-4, CCRF-CEM) and a non B, non T cell line (NALM-6) had no PAF binding sites and showed no PAF-induced increase in intracellular calcium levels. These studies demonstrate evidence for the presence of PAF receptors on several B lymphocyte cell lines.
