Ommaya reservoirs are routinely placed for the administration of intrathecal chemotherapy or antibiotics. There is scant literature that addresses the functionality of an Ommaya catheter placed exclusively within a cavum septum pellucidum (CSP). In this case, the authors placed an Ommaya reservoir in a 30-year-old man with Burkitt lymphoma in the CNS for intrathecal chemotherapy. The catheter tip was placed within a large CSP. The authors demonstrated failure of the system by injecting contrast agent into the reservoir and obtaining immediate and delayed CT scans that failed to demonstrate contrast dissemination into the ventricular system. An Ommaya reservoir placed exclusively within a CSP is potentially not functional, and can be dangerous if used for intrathecal drug therapy.
