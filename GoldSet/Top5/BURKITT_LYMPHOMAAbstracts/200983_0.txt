This paper describes two different experiments of nature: 1) the persistence of unusual virus strains of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (which proved oncogenic in vitro) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in lymphoid cells following congenital or early acquired infection; 2) the occurence of multiple cases of Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma in one family. All the members of this family were EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) and nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibody positive. The two patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma had high titers of EBV-VCA, EA, and EBNA antibodies. The only member of this family having EBV early antigen (EA antibodies in addition to the patients with tumors was the mother. Borderline IgA deficiency was documented in 3 members of this family. These findings illustrate the importance of host factors (intracellular resistance to transformation and secondarily, immunological surveillance) in the outcome of the host-virus challenge whether cancer or infectious disease is the outcome. Extensive studies of these cases may provide the best insight into the mysteries of viral oncogenesis.
