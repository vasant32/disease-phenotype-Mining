We present two cases of retroperitoneal masses with different presentations and outcomes. The first case was a 22 years old primigravida lady who underwent emergency caesarean section for preterm premature rupture of membranes with breach. On the operating table, a large retroperitoneal mass was identified and the biopsy confirmed Burkitt's lymphoma. Post operative chemotherapy did not have a favourable result and the patient had a fatal outcome. The other case was a 15 years old boy who had a progressively increasing retroperitoneal mass. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a hard, fixed, unresectable tumour extending into the mesentery of the small gut, biopsies were taken which showed tuberculosis. Post operative antituberculosis treatment had a marked response and the tumour disappeared after 6 months.
