Initiation of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic cycle is controlled by two immediate-early genes, BZLF1 and BRLF1. In certain epithelial and B-cell lines, their protein products, ZEBRA and Rta, stimulate their own expression, reciprocally stimulate each other's expression, and activate downstream viral targets. It has been difficult to examine the individual roles of these two transactivators in EBV-infected lymphocytes, as they are expressed simultaneously upon induction of the lytic cycle. Here we show that the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Raji represents an experimental system that allows the study of Rta's role in the lytic cycle of EBV in the absence and presence of ZEBRA. When expressed in Raji cells, exogenous Rta does not activate endogenous BZLF1 expression, yet Rta remains competent to transactivate certain downstream viral targets. Some genes, such as BaRF1, BMLF1, and a late gene, BLRF2, are maximally activated by Rta itself in the absence of detectable ZEBRA. The use of the Z(S186A) mutant form of ZEBRA, whose transactivation function is manifest only by coexpression of Rta, allows identification of a second class of lytic cycle genes, such as BMRF1 and BHRF1, that are activated in synergy by Rta and ZEBRA. It has already been documented that of the two activators, only ZEBRA stimulates the BRLF1 gene in Raji cells. Thus, there is a third class of viral genes activated by ZEBRA but not Rta. Moreover, ZEBRA exhibits an inhibitory effect on Rta's capacity to stimulate the late gene, BLRF2. Consequently ZEBRA may function to repress Rta's potential to activate some late genes. Raji cells thus allow delineation of the combinatorial roles of Rta and ZEBRA in control of several distinct classes of lytic cycle genes.
