Breast lymphomas are rare and consensus about their treatment is lacking. A population-based study of 38 breast lymphomas, registered in the databases of two Comprehensive Dutch Cancer Centers from 1981 to 1999, was performed. The median age of all female patients was 65 years (20-92): 25 patients had localized and 13 patients had disseminated lymphoma. The most common type was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which accounted for 17 of the localized and 4 of the disseminated cases. Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), three being disseminated, was found in four patients. There were six extranodal marginal zone lymphomas (ENMZL), three being localized. Seven DLBCL and one BL showed additional histological features of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Localized aggressive lymphomas treated with surgery and/or radiation therapy had relapse rates of 100% and 67%, respectively. Cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP)-like chemotherapy with or without local irradiation led to 17% relapses in patients with localized aggressive lymphoma. Median follow-up time was 32 months (0.6-218); 37% of the patients relapsed and 24% had progressive disease. Response to salvage regimens, given to 91% of the patients with recurrent disease, was poor. The 2-year overall survival rate was 63%, 72% for patients with localized disease, and 46% for patients with disseminated lymphoma. The majority of breast lymphomas are localized aggressive lymphomas that should be treated initially with CHOP-like chemotherapy with or without irradiation. The initial choice of treatment is very important because response to salvage regimens is poor.
