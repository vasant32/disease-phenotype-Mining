Studies were made of the expression of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in somatic hybrids of Burkitt tumor cells and human or mouse cells to determine whether EBV genetic information associated with the capacity to transform leukocytes of human and non-human primates could be maintained and expressed in nonlymphoblastoid cells. Data obtained thus far suggest that at least one characteristic associated with cellular transformation (loss of contact inhibition) is expressed only in nonlymphoblastoid cells in which the EBV genome is maintained. In addition, we have demonstrated that human epithelial/Burkitt hybrid cells (D98/HR-1 and D98/Raji) are more oncogenic in nude (athymic) mice than are cells of the human epithelial parental line, D98, or one of the Burkitt lymphoblastoid parent cell lines (Raji); the HR-1 Burkitt parent cell line was as oncogenic as the hybrid cell lines but the time required to induce tumors was much longer. Thus, human epithelial cells show alteration of growth properties in vitro and in vivo after cellular hybridization with Burkitt tumor cells.
