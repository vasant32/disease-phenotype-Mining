To evaluate the role of high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) in children with poor-prognosis Burkitt's lymphoma, the European Lymphoma BMT registry was critically reviewed. Between February 1979 and July 1991, a selected group of 89 children (78 boys and 11 girls) were considered as ABMT candidates in 12 European cancer centers for the following reasons: poor initial response (PIR) to first-line chemotherapy in 28 patients, primary refractory disease (PRD) in nine patients, sensitive relapse (SR) in 38 patients, and resistant relapse (RR) in 14 patients. The median age at ABMT was 8.2 years (range, 2.8 to 16.2 years). Thus, this report reflects data for patients surviving the salvage attempt deemed appropriate for HDC/ABMT and who then actually underwent the transplant procedure. The median follow-up period after HDC/ABMT was 4.3 years (range, 2 to 12 years). The prognosis was dismal for PRD patients and those with RR, ie, all patients died within 1 year. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 56.6% (P < .0001) for patients in partial remission (PR) and 48.7% (P = .002) for patients with SR. The toxic death rate was 11.1%. Continuous complete remissions (CRs) in 39.4% of these otherwise incurable children highlight the fact that HDC/ABMT was an effective complementary procedure after conventional-dose chemotherapy protocols used during the given period. In addition, these data show that patients with PRD or RR clearly had no advantage from this aggressive and cost-intensive procedure. It has to be considered that the need for HDC/ABMT has greatly diminished in parallel with the improvement in survival using the modern intensive pulsed CCT of current protocols. To further rescue patients failing to respond to modern protocols, new approaches appear necessary, ie, combinations of HDC with antibody-targeted therapy plus allogeneic BMT for the additional benefits of the potential graft-versus-lymphoma effect.
