Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) replicates in oral epithelial cells and gains entry to B-lymphocytes. In B-lymphocytes, EBV expresses a restricted subset of genes, the Latency III program, which converts B-lymphocytes to proliferating lymphoblasts. Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1) and the other Latency III associated proteins are also expressed during virus replication. LMP1 is essential for virus replication and egress from Akata Burkitt Lymphoma cells, but a role in epithelial cell replication has not been established. Therefore, we have investigated whether LMP1 enhances EBV replication and egress from HEK293 cells, a model epithelial cell line used for EBV recombinant molecular genetics. We compared wild type (wt) and LMP1-deleted (LMP1Δ) EBV bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) based virus replication and egress from HEK293. Following EBV immediate early Zta protein induction of EBV replication in HEK293 cells, similar levels of EBV proteins were expressed in wt- and LMP1Δ-infected HEK293 cells. LMP1 deletion did not impair EBV replication associated DNA replication, DNA encapsidation, or mature virus release. Indeed, virus from LMP1Δ-infected HEK293 cells was as infectious as EBV from wt EBV infected HEK cells. Trans-complementation with LMP1 reduced Rta expression and subsequent virus production. These data indicate that LMP1 is not required for EBV replication and egress from HEK293 cells.
