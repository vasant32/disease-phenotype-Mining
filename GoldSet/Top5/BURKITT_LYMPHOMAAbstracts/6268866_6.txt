A new continuous cell line, TL-1, was established in tissue culture from Burkitt's lymphoma arising at the ileocecal region. It has been maintained for the past two years. The cells were small and round, and grew in a suspension culture. Population doubling time was approximately 36 hours, The cells revealed the chromosomal abnormality i.e. translocation between 8 and 14 chromosomes, which was reported on some Burkitt's lymphomas. This line was negative for nuclear antigen of EB virus (EBNA) and bore surface IgA and not any receptors. Inoculums of 10(7) cells produced tumors in the athymic nude mice. The histological appearance of the tumor was consistent with the Burkitt's lymphoma. Ultrastructural findings showed nuclear blebs and clefts. As far as we know, this was the first cell line of Burkitt's lymphoma with t(8q-; 14q+) in Japan and perhaps the first lymphoma cell line with surface IgA.
