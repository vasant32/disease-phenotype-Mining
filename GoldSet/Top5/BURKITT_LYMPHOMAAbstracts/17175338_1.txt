Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) remains a major medical and surgical challenge in small pediatric patients. From April 2003 through October 2005, 17 infants (each of whom weighed less than 10 kg) underwent the procedure. Four were girls and 13 were boys (mean age, 15.7 +/- 9.3 months [range, 2-36 months]; mean weight at the time of transplantation, 7.4 +/- 2.6 kg [range, 6-10 kg]). All transplants were obtained from living-related donors. Sixteen left lateral segments and 1 left lobe were transplanted. The median graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 3.5% +/- 1.2% (range, 1.5%-6.1%). During the early postoperative period, hepatic arterial thrombosis was identified in 2 infants, and a biliary leak in 1. Hepatic arterial thrombosis was treated by reanastomosis with polytetrafluoroethylene grafting in the first patient and by surgical embolectomy in the second. The biliary leak was treated with percutaneous drainage. In 1 infant, portal vein stenosis, which was identified during the late postoperative period, was treated by percutaneous balloon dilatation. At this time, 14 (82.3%) infants were alive, exhibiting good graft function at a median follow-up of 11 months (range, 2-36 months). Three infants died: 1 on postoperative day 47 from adult respiratory distress syndrome, 1 on postoperative day 12 from sepsis, and 1 on postoperative day 65 from sepsis associated with EBV infection. Episodes of acute rejection, which occurred in 5 patients, were treated with pulse steroid therapy. On follow-up, histologic examination revealed hepatocellular carcinoma in 2 infants and Burkitt's lymphoma in 1 infant. Our data confirm that extensive use of living-related donors in liver transplantation can result in an excellent outcome for small pediatric patients.
