A 21-year-old woman who presented with pelvic mass, fever and cough was admitted. Ultrasonography revealed a large solid mass and serum CA125 was increased. A bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed and pathological diagnosis showed Burkitt lymphoma of bilateral ovaries. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administrated after surgery. However, on the next day, the patient had an unexpectedly high fever, sigh-like breathing, dilated pupils, and died despite rescue. This is the first report on the post-treatment tumor lysis syndrome with ovarian Burkitt's lymphoma. Identifying patients at risk and initiating therapy early are essential to avoid serious complications associated with tumor lysis syndrome.
