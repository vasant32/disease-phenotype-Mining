Sixty-three Turkish children with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) diagnosed over a 10-year period in a single institution were retrospectively analyzed. Burkitt's lymphoma included 41.7% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and 17.2% of all childhood malignant solid tumors diagnosed in our department in this duration. The patients studied with BL were aged between 3 and 14 years (mean 5.9 years), with a male of female ratio of 2:1. While the age distribution in our patients was similar to that in African BL (endemic), the predominance of abdominal involvement and the frequency of bone marrow infiltration and pleural effusion were reminiscent of American BL (sporadic). The incidence of jaw involvement (15.9%) in our group was higher than in American BL, however, and was not a high as in African BL. Most of the patients were of a lower socioeconomic status. Significant growth retardation was found in the children with BL compared with 40 age-matched children without malignancy, nor chronic or endocrinologic disorders, who were of a similar socioeconomic status. A serological study for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was performed in 18 children, and the IgG-type antibody to the viral capsid antigen of EBV was found to be positive in all of them. As a result, BL seems to include a considerable proportion of all childhood malignant solid tumors in Turkey. The epidemiological and clinical presentation and course indicate that BL appears in Turkish children in a form that is between the African and American types of the disease. Further molecular and chromosomal studies in Turkish children with BL are needed.
