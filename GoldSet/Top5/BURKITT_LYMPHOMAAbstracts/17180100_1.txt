Apoptosis, a form of physiological cell death, is a genetically determined program essential for normal development and maintenance of tissues, which has been linked to a variety of gene products. We have examined the susceptibility to radiation-induced apoptosis of cell lines derived from the human B cell tumour, Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), displaying a variety of phenotypic characteristics and expressing genes implicated in apoptosis at different levels. The susceptibility to apoptosis following gamma radiation varied significantly amongst the lines. Cell lines with wild type p53 were susceptible to radiation-induced apoptosis but two of five BL lines with only mutant p53 allele also displayed similar susceptibility. Some BL cell lines that expressed bcl-2 at levels comparable with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed normal B cells were highly susceptible to gamma radiation-induced apoptosis, whereas others expressing low levels were resistant. When these lines were analysed for bax and bcl-X(L) expression again no correlation was observed with susceptibility or resistance to apoptosis. Two BL cell lines having deregulated expression of c-myc were resistant to the induction of apoptosis while two others which had regulated c-myc expression were susceptible. Thus the status of p53, c-myc, bcl-2, bcl-X(L) and bax is not sufficiently informative in BL lines to predict susceptibility to radiation-induced apoptosis.
