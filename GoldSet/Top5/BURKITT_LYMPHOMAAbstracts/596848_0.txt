L-Asparaginase sensitivity and asparagin-deficiency of 5 tumor cell populations, i.e. mouse lymphoma L-1210, LI0-1, LTL, Berkitt lymphoma and human ovary cancer, line CaOv were studied. Radiometric estimation of 3H-thimidine incorporation into the cells of DNA served a criterion of cytotoxicity. "Krasnitin" (FDR) was used as L-asparaginase. The cells of leukemia L-1210, lymphosarcoma LIO-1 and line CaOv were asparagine-independent and non-sensitive to L-asparaginase. The cells of mouse lympholeukemia LTL and the cultures of Berkitt human lymphoma proved to be asparagin-dependent and highly sensitive to L-asparaginase. In concentration of 50 IU/ml the drug inhibited incorporation of 3H-thimidine in the cells of LTL and Berkitt lymphoma by 97-98 and 75-80 per cent respectively. Inhibition of 3H-thimidine incorporation in the cells of LTL and Berkitt lymphoma was more pronounced after incubation with the drug for 8 and 24 hours respectively. Two out of the 5 tumor cell populations were chosen as a result of the study. One of these 2 populations, i.e. the cells of Berkitt lymphoma was asparagin-dependent and highly sensitive to L-asparaginase, the other, i.e. the cells of line CaOv was asparagin-independent and resistant to the specific antitumor effect of the enzyme. The use of a system of these two cell lines provided estimation of the ratio of the specific cytostatic (antitumor activity) and non-specific cytostatic properties in the preparations with L-asparaginase activity.
