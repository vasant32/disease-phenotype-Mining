PCR was used to screen EBV-positive lymphomas from endemic and sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma patients, including EBV-positive lymphomas derived from patients with HIV infection. Only 10% of sporadic lymphomas from either North America (1/15) or South America (2/14) were associated with the type 2 EBV strain, whereas 50% (8/16) of lymphomas from equatorial Africa and 46% (10/22) of HIV-associated lymphomas were positive for the type 2 strain. These data, in conjunction with previous reports, suggest that the proportions of strain types in Burkitt's lymphoma reflect the proportions of strain types in peripheral lymphocytes, and not simply the prevailing regional strain. The increased association of the type 2 strain in lymphocytes and lymphomas from HIV-infected individuals and from Africa may be a result of intermittent (malaria) or continuous (HIU) compromise of immune function in these populations.
