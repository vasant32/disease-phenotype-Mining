 AIM: The objectives were to determine the prevalence and outcome of hypertension, significant microerythrocyturia and proteinuria among children with acute renal failure (ARF) due to Burkitt-type non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (BNHL). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of clinical and laboratory data of children with BNHL/ARF was undertaken. RESULTS: Nine of 23 (39.13%) BHNL/ARF children aged 5-14 years were found to have significant microerythrocyturia and proteinuria as urinary markers of glomerulonephritis (GN). Eight of nine were hypertensive with hypertensive encephalopathy (HTE) in three, and congestive heart failure (CCF)/pulmonary oedema in six. Three of nine patients (33.3%) died from these complications; two from CCF and one from a combination of CCF and HTE. A fourth death was due to uraemia. Treatments with cytotoxic drugs and anti-tumour lysis syndrome therapy resulted in normotension, improved clinical outcome and normalisation of laboratory features of ARF and GN in all five (55.6%) survivors. CONCLUSION: We conclude that all the children with BNHL/ARF had enlarged kidneys and evidence of glomerular disease. The mechanism of the glomerular disease is unclear. It is associated with a high mortality rate.
