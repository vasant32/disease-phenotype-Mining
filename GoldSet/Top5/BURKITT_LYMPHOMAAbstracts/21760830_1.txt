 BACKGROUND: Research and publications are critical to advancements in the quality of healthcare delivery. This article attempts to highlight the prospects and challenges of fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology as a tool for research in Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data available in local and international bibliographic databases for the period 1986-2005 (20 years) were collated and analyzed. RESULTS: The theme of Nigerian FNA-focused studies correlated with the recognized disease patterns in the country which are tuberculous lymphadenitis, breast tumors and Burkitt's lymphoma. The accuracy of FNA in these situations was high and comparable to the experience in developed countries. It was found that the total number of articles published during two contiguous periods (1986-1995 and 1996-2005) had increased from 5 to 18. Also, in majority of cases, the articles were not published in specialized pathology journals. CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of FNA is apparently lagging in Nigeria. Given its potential in resource-constrained settings, we are of the opinion that it should be used more often in clinical and translational research.
