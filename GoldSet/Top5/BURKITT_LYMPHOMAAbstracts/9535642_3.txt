 PURPOSE: To describe an unusual case of Burkitt lymphoma manifesting as acute proptosis and simulating orbital inflammatory disease. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 24-year-old Chinese man developed painful severe nonaxial proptosis in his left eye during 1 day. Computed tomographic scan disclosed an orbital mass that was shown to be Burkitt lymphoma when biopsy was performed. The disease progressed rapidly despite chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our case supports the fact that Burkitt lymphoma can manifest as acute proptosis and expands the spectrum of clinical presentation of Burkitt lymphoma.
