Cell surface proteins and glycoproteins of several human lymphoblastoid- and neoplastic hemopoietic cell lines were radiolabeled by lactoperoxidase catalysed iodination and by sodium periodate/tritiated sodium borohydride. Electrophoretic patterns of radiolabeled proteins and glycoproteins obtained by electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) were essentially similar for all examined lymphoblastoid cell lines, with a characteristic group of major radiolabeled glycoproteins gp44 and 24,31. Characteristic, individually different and distinguishable patterns of radiolabeled proteins were observed in different neoplastic hemopoietic cell lines: T-leukemia cell line MOLT 3, erythroleukemic cell line K562, pre-B cell leukemia line NALM 6, and a promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. Cell surface proteins of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line displayed some similarities to those of another myeloid leukemia cell line ML 3. Examined Burkitt lymphoma cell lines were similar to lymphoblastoid cell lines with some minor differences. Glycoprotein gp44, markedly labeled on lymphoblastoid cell lines, was absent on Burkitt lymphoma cell line Daudi. Electrophoretic patterns of cell surface proteins of blast cells from a few patients with leukemia examined simultaneously with the cell lines are described and discussed.
