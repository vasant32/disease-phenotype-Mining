A total of 69 patients of B lineage ALL, 35 children (32 males, 3 females) and 34 young adults (27 males, 7 females) were studied by multiplex RT-PCR to determine the relative frequency of t(9;22), t(12;21), t(1;19), and t(4;11,). Translocation (9;22) was seen in 1/35 (2.8%) and t(1;19) in 2/35 (5.7%) children. None of the children showed t(12;21) and t(4;11) translocations. In young adults, t(9;22) and t(1;19) were seen in 5/34 (14.7%) and 2/34 (5.8%) patients, respectively. None of the latter showed t(12;21) or t(4;11) translocations. Thus, there appears to be a significant under representation of the fusion transcripts for TEL-AML, a good prognostic marker, in this study, unlike in the West, where it is seen in 35% of children with ALL. This, together with the generally increased leukemic burden seen in Indian patients, may explain in part, the poor treatment outcome reported.
