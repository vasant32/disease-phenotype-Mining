A histological classification of 36 cases of malignant lymphoma in slaughtered swine is reported. All the lymphomas observed were diagnosed as diffuse types and were further classified into four types by their histological characteristics based on the classification of the Japanese Lymphoma Study Group (Suchi et al., 1979). The cases consisted of 16 of the Burkitt type, 2 of the immunoblastic type, 3 of the medium-sized cell type and 15 of the mixed cell type. The histological appearances of these lymphomas were compared with those of human lymphomas. All tumours closely resembled non-Hodgkin's diffuse type of B cell lymphoma and differed from tumours in other sites such as the liver and kidneys.
