Anti-IgG treatment activated latent EBV genomes in 50 to 70% of the cells of the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Akata. The EBV-activating role of intracellular Ca2+, as potentiated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and suppressed by cAMP, was analyzed in the cells through effects of agonists and antagonists of these second messenger pathways. Early Ag (EA) was induced in 10% of cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 (A23187). EA induction with anti-IgG or A23187 was blocked by a calmodulin antagonist, trifluoperazine. The DAG pathway had a potentiating but not direct effect on EBV activation because: 1) the DAG analog, dioctanoylglycerol (diC8), an agonist for protein kinase C, alone induced only 2% EA-positive cells, 2) diC8 synergized with A23187 for EA induction, and 3) the protein kinase C antagonist, staurosporine, almost completely inhibited EA induction by anti-IgG. When cells were reincubated in medium with fresh diC8 and A23187 at 3, 6, 9, and 12 h, EA induction at 24 h reached the levels seen with anti-IgG stimulation. A cAMP-mediated pathway suppressed EBV activation because dibutyryl cAMP or 8-bromo-cAMP, plus blockage of phosphodiesterase by theophylline, or use of forskolin, inhibited EA induction with anti-IgG. Although the principal stimulatory role in EBV activation of a Ca2(+)-mediated, second messenger pathway, as synergized by DAG and inhibited by cAMP, was established, we did not explain the significant lag in EA induction by A23187 and diC8 as compared with anti-IgG induction of EA. We conclude that EBV genome activation with anti-IgG is mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin and DAG pathways in Akata cells, that the cAMP pathway suppresses EA induction by anti-IgG, and that a mechanism regulating the speed of EA induction remains unexplained.
