We have recently identified a novel CCAAT box binding protein (ICBP90) involved in the regulation of topoisomerase IIalpha gene expression. We have observed that it is expressed in non-tumoral proliferating human lung fibroblast cells whereas in HeLa cells, a tumoral cell line, ICBP90 was still present even when cells were at confluence. In the present study, we have determined the ICBP90 gene structure by screening of a human placenta genomic library and PCR analysis. We report that the ICBP90 gene spans about 35.8 kb and contains six coding exons named A to F. In the 5' upstream sequence of the region containing the coding exons, two additional exons (I and II) were found. Additionally, an internal splicing site was found in exon A. A promoter region, including three putative Sp1 binding sites between exons I and A, was identified by transient transfection. Northern blot analysis of several cancer cell lines revealed the existence of two ICBP90 mRNA species of 5.1 and 4.3 kb that are transcribed from the gene. The relative amounts of these mRNAs depended on the cell type. In MOLT-4 cells and Burkitt's lymphoma Raji cells, the 4.3 kb or the 5.1 kb transcripts were mainly observed, respectively. In other cell lines, such as HL-60 cells, chronic myelogenous leukaemia K-562, lung carcinoma A549, HeLa or colorectal SW480, both 4.3 and 5.1 kb forms of ICBP90 mRNA could be detected. Interestingly, western blot analysis showed several ICBP90 protein bands in HeLa but only a single band in MOLT-4 cell extracts. Taken together our results are consistent with the ICBP90 gene exhibiting alternative splicing and promoter usage in a cell-specific manner.
