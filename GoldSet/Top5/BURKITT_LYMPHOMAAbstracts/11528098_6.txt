The liver is an uncommon primary site for malignant lymphoma, and primary hepatic lymphoma has been found to make up 0.4% of all extranodal lymphomas. We report a rare case of a 75-year-old Japanese male with primary hepatic Burkitt's lymphoma, according to both the revised European-American Lymphoma classification and the new World Health Organization classification. As not only histological findings but also immunological features are deemed essential in the diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma, the previous 7 cases of primary hepatic Burkitt's lymphoma were not fully evaluated, using these criteria. As far as we know, this is the first case of primary hepatic Burkitt's lymphoma with typical features on histological, immunological and cytogenetical analysis. He had a history of chronic hepatitis C over several decades with subsequent liver cirrhosis. From our review of the literature and our case, the relationship between hepatitis C virus infection and the development of primary hepatic Burkitt's lymphoma remains obscure.
