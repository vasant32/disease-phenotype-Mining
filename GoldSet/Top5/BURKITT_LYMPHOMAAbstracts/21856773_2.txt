Resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene), a polyphenolic natural product, shows chemopreventive properties against several cancers, heart diseases, inflammation, and viral infections. Epstein Barr virus (EBV), a γ-herpesvirus, contributes to the development of several human cancers including Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). In this study, we asked whether treatment with resveratrol would affect the viability of EBV-positive BL cells displaying different forms of latency. We report here that resveratrol, regardless of EBV status, induces caspase-dependent apoptosis by arresting cell-cycle progression in G(1) phase. However, resveratrol strongly induced apoptosis in EBV(-) and latency I EBV(+) cells, whereas latency II and latency III EBV(+) BL cells showed a survival advantage that increased with the extent of the pattern of viral gene expression. Resveratrol-induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis occurred in association with induction of p38 MAPK phosphorylation and suppression of ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Moreover, NF-κB DNA-binding activity was inhibited in all BL lines except EBV(+) latency III cells. LMP1 oncogene, which is expressed in latency III phenotype, is involved with the higher resistance to the antiproliferative effect of resveratrol because siRNA-mediated inhibition of LMP1 greatly increased the sensitivity of latency III BL cells as well as that of lymphoblastoid cell lines to the polyphenol. We propose that a combined resveratrol/siRNA strategy may be a novel approach for the treatment of EBV-associated B-cell malignancies in which the viral pattern of gene expression has been defined.
