Nodal presentation of Burkitt-like lymphoma is common, particularly in gastrointestinal tract. However, only few cases with massive ascites and signs of subileus due to lymphoma proliferation are described. We report a 31-year-old male patient who presented with fever, night sweats, vomiting and abdominal fullness. Physical examination suggested much ascites. Abdominal X-rays showed hydroaeric levels. Diagnosis or Burkitt-like lymphoma was established on the basis of cytological and immunohistochemical examination of ascites (immune phenotype of malignant cells was EMA-, NSE-, LCA+, CD10 -/+, CD20 +, IgM +, Ki-67 + 100%). After treatment with BMF protocol complete remission was achieved and retained for 2.5 years. Authors stressed that immunohistochemical examination of ascites has been proved as simple and efficient method for establishing precise diagnosis. In this way, laparotomy was avoided, which otherwise would be necessary due to exclusive abdominal localization of the disease.
