IFNs are a family of cytokines that are involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. Clinical use of IFN-alpha/beta encompasses treatment for a variety of diseases; however, prolonged exposure to IFN-alpha/beta results in elevated levels of autoreactive Abs. In this study, we investigated the potential of IFNs to modulate apoptotic signals in B cells. We demonstrate that IFN-alpha or IFN-beta inhibit Ag receptor-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3' (PI3)-kinase did not abolish the effect of IFN, indicating that the antiapoptotic mechanism is PI3-kinase- and protein kinase B/Akt-independent. Instead, IFN-alpha and IFN-beta, but not IFN-gamma, significantly increase the levels of the survival protein Bcl-2, and to a lesser extent, Bcl-xL expression. Thus, IFN-alpha/beta-mediated inhibition of B cell Ag receptor-triggered apoptosis may offer a model for the process that leads to the escape of self-reactive B cells from negative selection and consequently results in autoantibody production.
