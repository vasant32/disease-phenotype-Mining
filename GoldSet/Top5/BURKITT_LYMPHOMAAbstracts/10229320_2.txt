To determine the incidence of haematological malignancies in French Polynesia from 1990 to 1995, we collected cases from the local cancer registry, sanitary evacuation files and all the histopathology and clinical biology laboratories. All leukaemias, non Hodgkin's lymphomas, and multiple myelomas incidence was slightly lower among French Polynesians than among Maoris from New-Zealand and Hawaiians of Hawaii. Standardised Incidence Ratio (SIR) for Hodgkin's disease among females was 0.08 when comparing to Hawaiians and 0.33 when comparing to Maoris. Other salient features were a high proportion of high grade and Burkitt's lymphoma, the absence of Hodgkin's disease after 40 years of age, a low incidence of chronic lymphoid leukaemia, and a high non lymphoblastic/lymphoblastic acute leukaemia ratio in childhood. This study stresses the peculiar incidence of some haematological malignancies in this south pacific area.
