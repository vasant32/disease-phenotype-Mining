PURPOSE: To prove the efficacy of a treatment stratified according to histology for children with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), including acute B-cell leukemia (B-ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October 1986 to March 1990, 302 assessable patients, 0.6 to 17.8 years of age, with newly diagnosed NHL were enrolled onto study ALL/NHL-BFM 86. Fifty percent of patients had Burkitt-type lymphomas, including B-ALL; 24% had lymphoblastic lymphoma; 18% had diffuse large-cell lymphoma; and 8% had an NHL not further classified. Therapy group B included Burkitt's-type lymphomas, B-ALL, and most large-cell lymphomas including Ki-1 anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Patients with stage I and II disease resected received three, while all others received six, 5-day therapy courses (dexamethasone, methotrexate [MTX] 0.5 g/m2 [5 g/m2 for stage IV and B-ALL], and intrathecal [IT] therapy in each course, plus ifosfamide, cytarabine, and etoposide alternating with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin). Therapy for group non-B patients (lymphoblastic lymphoma and pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma [PTCL]) consisted of a Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster (BFM) acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol, including cranial irradiation for advanced stage. Local therapy was restricted to patients with incomplete tumor regression. RESULTS: The probabilities of event-free survival (pEFS) at 7 years were 80% +/- 2% for the whole group, 81% +/- 3% for group B (n = 225), and 78% +/- 5% for group non-B (n = 77) with a follow-up duration of 3.6 to 7 years (median 5 years). Treatment results were comparable between NHL subtypes, except for PTCL, in which three of four patients suffered from relapse. Local disease manifestations were the most frequent site of failure. CONCLUSION: This therapy strategy provided patients of all NHL subtypes with an equally high chance to survive event-free, except patients with PTCL. With reduced systemic failure, local tumor control may become more important.
