The chromosomal translocation t(8;14) is the hallmark of Burkitt's-lymphoma (BL) and fuses the proto-oncogene c-MYC to the IGH locus. We analyzed the genomic structure of MYC/IGH fusions derived from a large series of 78 patients with t(8;14) and asked (i) whether distinct breakpoint clusters exist within the MYC gene and (ii) whether any pairwise association between particular IGH and MYC breakpoints exist. Identification of such associations will help elucidate the etiology of the breaks on the MYC locus. Scan statistic analyses revealed two distinct, but large clusters within c-MYC containing 60/78 (77%) of the breakpoints. Clusters 1 and 2 were 560 and 779 bp in length within a 4555 bp breakpoint cluster region. Breaks within IGH switch mu and joining region did not differ with respect to their corresponding MYC breakpoints. However, there was a highly significant correlation between breakpoints 5' of MYC cluster 1 and fusions to IGH switch gamma region and breakpoints downstream of MYC cluster 2 and fusions to IGH switch alpha region (chi(2)-test: P<0.005). Chromatin changes governing choice of IGH-Fc region recombination may parallel changes in the MYC gene 5' region chromatin leading to some degree of coordinated ontological specificity in breakpoint location.
