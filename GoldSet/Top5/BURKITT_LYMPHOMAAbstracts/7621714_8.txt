We reviewed 13 cases of small non-cleaved cell (Burkitt's) lymphoma diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and four cases where that diagnosis was made from touch imprints from surgical biopsy specimens. The most common site was intraabdominal. Histologic confirmation was present in 14/17 cases. General microscopic features on smears included high cellularity and an individual cell pattern. Extracellular lymphoglandular bodies were abundant and tingible body macrophages were prominent. Nuclei were intermediate in size and round with a finely dispersed chromatin pattern on May-Gr√ºnwald-Giemsa stained smears. Cytoplasm was basophilic and scant with prominent vacuoles. Extracellular vacuoles and vacuoles within lymphoglandular bodies occurred in all patients. Immunocytochemistry performed on 16/17 cases demonstrated a B cell phenotype in 15. Nine cases were kappa light chain positive and six were lambda light chain positive. Flow cytometry performed in five cases demonstrated diploid cells with a high S phase. We conclude that Burkitt's lymphoma can be diagnosed using combined FNAB and immunophenotyping.
