Induction of EBV early antigens in the non-producer lymphoid cell line RAJI by treatment with PHA in the presence of IUdR has been shown to be a convenient and efficient procedure for the preparation of cells for EBV serology. This induction procedure results in significant levels of EA-D and EA-R positive cells. The serological titres obtained on cell preparations induced with PHA and IUdR were comparable to those obtained on smears prepared by the classical procedure requiring infectious EBV. This convenient method of induction can replace more cumbersome techniques for routine EBV serology.
