Monoclonal antibody 38.13 detects an epitope presented on Burkitt's lymphoma cells that has not been detected on other lymphoid tissues or tumors. The biochemical nature of this Burkitt's lymphoma-associated antigen was investigated by staining inhibition assays. Indirect immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis show that antibody 38.13 reacts with a protease-resistant structure present among the hydrophobic components extracted with chloroform-methanol from the Ramos Burkitt's cell line. These components were further separated by ion-exchange chromatography and activity resides in the unbound (neutral) fraction. The staining antibody is specifically absorbed when preincubated with D-galactose, and to a lesser extent with N-acetyl-galactosamine. Therefore, 38.13 appears to recognize a determinant of carbohydrate nature, which is carried on a neutral glycolipid.
