Hybrids constructed with the murine fibroblasts IT22 and either human lymphoid cells or human melanoma cells retain the human chromosomes 1, 14, and 21 and lose the human chromosome 2. The human lymphocyte-mouse fibroblast hybrids preferentially retain the human chromosome 11, while the human melanoma-murine fibroblast hybrids preferentially retain the human chromosome 8 and lose the human chromosome X. These data suggest that the type of human parental cell used to construct human-rodent hybrids can influence the segregation of human chromosomes.
