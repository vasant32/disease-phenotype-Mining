 PURPOSE: To review the efficacy of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, methotrexate with leucovorin, and prednisone (ProMACE)-based combination chemotherapy programs in the treatment of patients with diffuse small noncleaved-cell non-Burkitt's lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients with diffuse small noncleaved-cell non-Burkitt's lymphoma were accrued: eight with localized disease were treated with modified ProMACE-mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) plus involved-field radiation therapy, and 25 with advanced-stage disease were treated with ProMACE/MOPP flexitherapy (n = 8), ProMACE-MOPP (n = 9), or ProMACE-cytarabine, bleomycin, vincristine, and methotrexate with leucovorin (CytaBOM) (n = 8). The median follow-up duration is 10 years. RESULTS: All eight patients with localized disease achieved a complete response, none have relapsed, and one died of intercurrent illness. Among patients with advanced-stage disease, five of eight (63%) flexitherapy-treated patients, six of nine (67%) ProMACE-MOPP-treated patients, and eight of eight (100%) ProMACE-CytaBOM-treated patients achieved a complete response. If the two ProMACE-MOPP-based groups are considered together, disease-free and overall survival rates at 15 years are projected at 61% and 35%, respectively. In contrast, only one patient has relapsed from a ProMACE-CytaBOM-induced complete remission, and overall survival of ProMACE-CytaBOM-treated patients (88%) is significantly higher than that for flexitherapy and ProMACE-MOPP (P2 = .04). CONCLUSION: Adult patients with diffuse small non-cleaved-cell non-Burkitt's lymphoma may be effectively treated with regimens that are effective in other aggressive lymphomas (eg, diffuse large-cell lymphoma).
