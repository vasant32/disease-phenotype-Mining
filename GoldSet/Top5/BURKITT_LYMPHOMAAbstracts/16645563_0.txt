Primary malignant lymphoma of the ovary is a rare tumor (1,5% of ovarian tumors). Clinically, it occurs as an abdominal mass with pain which can be confused with an epithelial ovary tumor. Most tumors are observed during the fourth decade. Burkitt lymphoma, is sporadic in western countries, usually with abdominal involvement. Diagnosis is guided by biological analysis and imaging. Prognosis depends on medullary and neuromeningeal involvement. Polychemotherapy is required. We report a case of a young woman who developed abdominal Burkitt Lymphoma mimicking advanced-stage bilateral ovarian cancer.
