OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between malignancy and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in children. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: The Paediatric Oncology Unit at Parirenyatwa Teaching Hospital. SUBJECTS: 76 consecutive newly diagnosed cases of malignancy between May 15 and November 15 1997. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HIV serostatus. RESULTS: 27 out of 64 children were HIV seropositive, giving a seroprevalance rate of 42.2% (95% CI 30.1 to 54.3%). The four commonest diagnosed malignancies were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (22.4%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (19.7%), Wilm's tumour (19.7%) and Kaposi's sarcoma (15.8%). These tumours accounted for 77.6% of all malignancies. Nine of a total of 17 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were HIV positive and all 12 patients with Kaposi's were also HIV positive. No cases of Burkitt's lymphoma were seen. Although there was increased incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) compared to previous years, there was no significant association with the HIV serostatus. A significant association between Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and HIV serostatus was observed (p < 0.001). Children with KS were more likely to be HIV seropositive. Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Wilm's tumours (WT) were 83 and 88% less likely to be HIV seropositive, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HIV has transformed the pattern of childhood malignancy in Zimbabwe. The two tumours mostly affected are NHL and KS.
