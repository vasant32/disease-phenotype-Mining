The third internal repeat (IR3) simple repeat array in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA has a high degree of homology to a reiterated component of cell DNAs. 32P-Labeled human or mouse DNAs hybridize to the IR3 sequence on Southern blots of viral DNA. EBV IR3 probe identifies many restriction enzyme fragments on Southern blots of human and mouse DNAs that have extensive homology to IR3. Cytological hybridization shows that IR3 is homologous to at least one region on each human chromosome except the Y chromosome.
