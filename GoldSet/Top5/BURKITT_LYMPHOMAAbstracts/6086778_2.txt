Sendai and Newcastle disease viruses were tested for their induction potential in the production of human lymphoblastoid interferon [HuIFN-alpha(Ly)] from Namalva cell cultures. Tests were performed at multiple induction levels, for two induction periods, and on primed and nonprimed cell cultures. Sendai virus proved statistically more effective overall; priming and induction period had no significant effect.
