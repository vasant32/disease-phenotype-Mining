Treatment of human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells with interferons inhibits cell proliferation in culture within 24 h. The failure of cell growth has been shown to be associated with impaired processing and decreased stability of newly replicated DNA. Because there is a close relationship between DNA replication and protein synthesis we have measured protein synthesis in intact Daudi cells. Protein synthesis declined steadily between 24 and 96 h after interferon treatment to a value which is only 20-30% of the rate in control cells. The enzyme 2',5'-oligo(A) synthetase is induced but our data do not support a role for the 2',5'-oligo(A)-activated ribonuclease in the control of translation in this system.
