The effects of naturally-occuring polyphenols, resveratrol and quercetin, on cell viability and apoptosis were studied in Namalwa B-cell lymphoma line. Apoptotic cells were identified using DNA flow cytometric analysis and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The effects of the agents on the cell cycle kinetics and activation of caspase-3 were examined. Both resveratrol and quercetin induced apoptosis in Namalwa cells as demonstrated by the increased number of hypodiploid cells, elevated level of mobile lipid domains and caspase-3 activation. Treatment with 40 microM of resveratrol for 48 h resulted in time-dependent cell-cycle arrest at G0/G1. In contrast, upon quercetin treatment Namalwa cells accumulated in G2/M. Obtained results suggest that resveratrol and quercetin induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in human malignant lymphoid cells in vitro. These findings provide a rationale for further studies of in vivo effects of those polyphenols.
