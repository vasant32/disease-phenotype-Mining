We examined the response in the free intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) of Daudi (human lymphoblastoid) cells to antibodies against human immunoglobulins (anti-Ig), and the relationship of [Ca2+]i to anti-Ig-induced capping. At 80 microM intracellular quin-2 (a fluorescent probe for [Ca2+]i), anti-Ig (10 micrograms/ml) caused a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i from 100 to 600 nM; the signal returned to baseline with approximately 1 min. At 450 microM intracellular quin-2, [Ca2+]i rose to only approximately 250 microM, and the signal declined gradually, returning to base line after greater than 7 min. In subsequent experiments, the lower concentrations of quin-2 were employed. Plots of the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transients and of the binding of 125I-anti-Ig to Daudi cells versus the concentrations of anti-Ig showed similar saturation kinetics, with half-saturation occurring at 2-3 micrograms/ml. Part of the calcium in the transient is derived from the extracellular medium, and part from the nonmitochondrial intracellular stores. Caffeine (4 mM) and 8-(diethylamino)octyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate HCl (0.5 mM) suppressed the release of calcium from internal stores and the entry of calcium from outside the cells, but permitted capping in more than half of the cells. Phorbol esters (1-2 nM) inhibited both capping and the anti-Ig-induced decrease in [Ca2+]i. None of these agents blocked the binding of anti-Ig to the cells. It appears that receptor capping is not dependent on the anti-Ig-induced transient increase in calcium concentration.
