We report a case of B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia which showed histological transformation from an FAB-L2 into a Burkitt's type (FAB-L3). Both leukemias had identical immunoglobulin heavy-chain joining gene and kappa light-chain joining gene rearrangements, indicating the clonal identity of the two leukemias. A chromosomal analysis of leukemia cells on the onset indicated normal karyotype, whereas that of the transformed FAB-L3 showed t(8;14)(q24;q32). Furthermore, the proto-oncogene c-myc was in the germline configuration in the initial leukemia but in the rearranged configuration after transformation. Presence of t(8;14)(q24;q32) and the c-myc gene rearrangement after transformation suggested that the chromosomal translocation followed by the activation of the c-myc proto-oncogene might be involved in the Burkitt's type transformation of the FAB-L2 leukemic clone, but not in the leukemogenesis of the initial FAB-L2 leukemia.
