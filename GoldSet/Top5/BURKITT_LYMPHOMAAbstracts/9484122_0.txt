A six-year-old girl was evaluated for an intraoral mass of 5 months duration, which had been treated with antibiotics in a district hospital. Extraoral examination showed a firm, non-tender swelling at the angular region of the left mandible with regional lymphadenopathy. Intraoral examination revealed a mass extending from the left mandibular primary first molar to the retromolar region, interfering normal occlusion. The mass was painful and firm, peduculated and reddish in appearance. The remainder of the oral examination was unremarkable. Panoramic radiograph and CT scan showed a large multilocular radiolucency beginning from the bud of second premolar, extending to the mandibular ramus that displaced the bud of second molar. Incisional biopsy of the intraoral mass was performed and the result was reported as Burkitt's lymphoma. The child was treated with chemotherapy and radiation, with recurrence.
