PATIENTS AND METHOD: We studied patients with acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) from January 1985 to October 2001. RESULTS: 44 patients (36 men, 8 women; median age 34 years) were included. Burkitt's lymphoma was diagnosed in 34%, and diffuse large cell B lymphoma in 29.5%. A history of AIDS diagnosis was detected in 20 cases (45%). International prognostic index (IPI) was 0-1 in 19 patients (43%), 2 in 12 (27%) and higher than 3 in 13 (30%). Chemotherapy was used in 64% of the patients, radiation therapy in 2% and both in 11%. Criteria for partial response were reached in 13 patients (29%), for complete remission in 2 (4%) and for stabilization in 1 (2%). Nine (20%) patients are alive (5 without disease), 22 (50%) died because of NHL, 5 (11%) died because of treatment associated toxicity and 8 died because of other causes. Median survival were 3 months, with a 1-year survival estimate of 24% and a 2-year survival estimate of 14%. In the univariate analysis of prognostic factors, IPI = 0-1 in comparison with IPI = 2-5 (p = 0.000), physical status (PS) < or = 2 (p = 0.021) and absence of B symptoms (p = 0.012) were significant. In the multivariate analysis, IPI = 0-1 was also significant (p = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HIV and NHL has multiple factors of poor prognosis. The survival is limited and chemotherapy toxicity is high. Patients with low IPI are a subgroup with better prognosis.
