Eight British adults with tumours histologically and cytochemically identical to African Burkitt's lymphoma are described. In each case there was an acute clinical onset and similar tumour distribution, with involvement of the intra-abdominal organs, bone marrow and central nervous system. Jaw tumours were only present in 3 cases, and were never gross. Four patients presented as acute leukaemia. Combination chemotherapy and cranial irradiation were used to eradicate disease, but complete remissions were obtained in only 3 patients, and survival of over 1 year in only 2. The remainder died with disease present, less than 5 months from diagnosis.
