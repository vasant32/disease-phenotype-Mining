We studied 23 Polish children with precursor-B-ALL, using PCR-heteroduplex analysis and DNA sequencing, to determine the availability of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements as patient-specific MRD-RQ-PCR targets. We found IGH, IGK-Kde, incomplete TCRD, Vdelta2-Jalpha, TCRG and TCRB rearrangements in 83%, 39%, 61%, 35%, 61% and 13% of patients, respectively. Comparison of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements pattern (frequency and characteristics of rearrangements) in Polish patients with those reported for patients of other European nationalities did not show major differences. These results are the first promising step for further development of MRD study in Polish patients according to current diagnostic standards.
