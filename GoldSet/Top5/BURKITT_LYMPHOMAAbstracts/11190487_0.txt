 UNLABELLED: Preliminary evaluations of 125I-labeled Lym-1, an anti-lymphoma mouse IgG2a monoclonal antibody, demonstrated favorable tumor uptake in mice bearing human Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji) tumors. In this study, the pharmacokinetics of 125I- and 131I-Lym-1, and the dosimetry, efficacy, and toxicity of 131I-Lym-1 in Raji-tumored mice were evaluated. METHODS: Lym-1 was radioiodinated by the chloramine-T method and analyzed for monomeric fraction and immunoreactivity (antigen cell binding, relative to unmodified Lym-1). Nude mice bearing Raji tumors (20-500 mm3) received 1.5 MBq (40 microCi) 125I-Lym-1, or 1.5, 7.4, 14.8, or 18.5 MBq (40, 200, 400, or 500 microCi) 131I-Lym-1. Pharmacokinetic data (total body and blood clearance and biodistribution) were used to estimate radiation dosimetry. Mini-thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) was also used to measure radiation dosimetry directly for 7 days after injection of 131I-Lym-1. Tumor size, survival, body weight, and blood counts were monitored for 60 days to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of 131I-Lym-1. RESULTS: At the time of injection, the mean quality assurance (QA) values for 125I-Lym-1 were 100% monomer and 100% relative immunoreactivity; the corresponding values for 131I-Lym-1 were 73% and 66%, indicating that radiolysis had occurred during the interval between radiolabeling and injection. 125I-Lym-1 exhibited high and sustained concentration in tumors relative to normal organs, whereas 131I-Lym-1 did not. Assuming identical pharmacokinetic behavior to 125I-Lym-1, 131I-Lym-1 would deliver radiation doses of 3.45, 0.83, 1.03, 0.34, and 0.56 Gy per MBq injected (12.8, 3.1, 3.8, 1.3, and 2.1 rad/microCi), to tumor, liver, lungs, total body, and marrow, respectively. When the actual pharmacokinetic data for 131I-Lym-1 (1.5 MBq) were used to estimate dosimetry, corresponding values of 0.51, 0.72, 0.49, 0.31, and 0.41 Gy/MBq (1.9, 2.7, 1.8, 1.1, and 1.5 rad/microCi) were obtained. Similar values were obtained for mice receiving 7.4 or 14.8 MBq of 131I-Lym-1. Similarly, TLD data indicated little preferential radiation dosimetry to tumor. Response rates (cure + CR + PR) for mice receiving 0, 7.4, 14.8, and 18.5 MBq of 131I-Lym-1 were 8%, 7%, 21%, and 45%, respectively. The LD50/30 dose of 131I-Lym-1 was 12.7 MBq (343 microCi). CONCLUSIONS: 125I-Lym-1 exhibited high and sustained concentration in Raji tumors in mice, indicating excellent therapeutic potential for 131I-Lym-1. However, in vitro QA results for 131I-Lym-1 indicated that radiolysis had occurred, and 131I-Lym-1 demonstrated little accumulation in tumor, or preferential radiation dosimetry to tumor in the same model.
