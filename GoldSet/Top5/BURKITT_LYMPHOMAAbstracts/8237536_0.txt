Review of one case of Burkitt's lymphoma in a 60 year-old male diagnosed with a renal tumour based on the symptomatology, intravenous urography (IVU), ultrasound and CT. In spite of the chemotherapy applied, the patient died 31 days after hospitalization. Burkitt's lymphoma is an infrequent tumour in our setting and renal invasion is rarely observed. The tumour's nature is neither revealed by IVU or ultrasound, CT being the most appropriate imaging technique showing a mass of decreased density that surrounds and infiltrates the tumour. The therapeutical approach for renal tumours is the same as for Burkitt's lymphoma. Besides the rarity of Burkitt's lymphoma, our patient was an atypical case for the age of presentation, early stage of renal invasion and fulminant evolution.
