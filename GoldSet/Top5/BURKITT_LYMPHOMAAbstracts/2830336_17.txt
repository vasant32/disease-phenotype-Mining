Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) is a 22-kDa exotoxin produced by most Staphylococcus aureus strains responsible for toxic shock syndrome. TSST-1 is a mitogen for human T cells. The mechanism of T cell activation by TSST-1 was investigated. TSST-1 induced IL-2R expression, IL-2 synthesis, and proliferation in T cells in a monocyte-dependent fashion. Neither IL-1 nor IL-2, alone or in combination, substituted for monocytes in supporting TSST-1-induced mitogenesis. We investigated the mechanism by which TSST-1 induces initogenesis. TSST-1 failed to induce ADP-ribosylation of T cell membrane proteins. However, the toxin induced transient translocation of protein kinase C from cytosol to plasma membranes and also induced the mobilization of cellular Ca2+ stores in both PBMC and the Jurkat human tumor T cell line, suggesting that TSST-1 triggered inositol phospholipid turnover. This was directly demonstrated to be the case in both cellular preparations studied. TSST-1 induced the increased synthesis of the inositol phospholipid phosphatidyl inositol, phosphatidyl inositol-4 phosphate, and phosphoinositol inositol-4,5-bisphosphate, and induced the breakdown of inositol phospholipid as evidence by the accumulation of phosphatidic acid and inositol phosphates. We conclude that the action of TSST-1 involves the induction of inositol phospholipid turnover, protein kinase C activation, and mobilization of cellular Ca2+ stores. This effect is similar to that of mitogenic lectins and of anti-CD3 antibodies.
