Many tumors are characterized by recurrent translocations between a tissue-specific gene and a proto-oncogene. The juxtaposition of the Ig heavy chain gene and Myc in Burkitt's lymphoma and in murine plasmacytoma is a classic example. Regulatory elements within the heavy chain constant region locus are required for Myc translocation and/or deregulation. However, many genes are regulated by cis-acting elements at distances up to 1,000 kb outside the locus. Such putative distal elements have not been examined for the heavy chain locus, particularly in the context of Myc translocations. We demonstrate that a transgene containing the Ig heavy chain constant region locus, inserted into five different chromosomal locations, can undergo translocations involving Myc. Furthermore, these translocations are able to generate plasmacytomas in each transgenic line. We conclude that the heavy chain constant region locus itself includes all of the elements necessary for both the translocation and the deregulation of the proto-oncogene.
