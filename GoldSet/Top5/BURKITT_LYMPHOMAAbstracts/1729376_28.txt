Using a subtractive cDNA approach, we have identified a number of genes expressed in murine plasmacytomas, but not B or pre-B lymphomas. One of these genes, 289A, expresses a 1.8-kb microsomally localized mRNA that encodes a 314-amino-acid protein containing a signal sequence and a hydrophobic transmembrane domain. Sequence comparison suggests that the predicted protein is the murine homologue of a human cell surface pan-epithelial glycoprotein known variously as EGP, GA733-2, KSA, and KS1/4, recognized by mAb HEA125, GA733, KS1/4, CO17-1A, M74, and 323/A3. The 289A mRNA is highly expressed in normal murine tissues containing epithelial cells, and at a low level in plasma cells induced by LPS stimulation of spleen B lymphocytes. It is expressed in 15 of 16 plasmacytomas, but at a much lower level, if at all, in pre-B or B lymphomas. In human B cell lines, 289A detects a 1.5-kb mRNA in the myeloma cell line 8226, but not in Burkitt's lymphoma or lymphoblastoid cell lines. Subsequent FACS analysis of human cell lines with the mAb GA733 and KS1/4 demonstrated concordant expression of the mRNA and the protein. We conclude that 289A is the murine homologue of EGP, GA733-2, KSA, and KS1/4 Ag. Although its expression was previously thought to be restricted to epithelial cells, it is also expressed in plasma cells and is a B lymphocyte differentiation Ag. Because of the multiplicity of names, we propose calling the human gene hEGP314, and the murine gene mEGP314.
