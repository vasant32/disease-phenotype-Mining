The cytotoxic effect of the new potential intercalating anticancer drug oracin was studied on Burkitt's lymphoma cell line that overexpressed bcl-2 (BL bcl-2) and a control transfectant without the bcl-2 gene (BL SV2). Oracin showed a marked cytostatic effect on both BL SV2 and BL bcl-2 cells. IC50, as measured by the MTT assay, was approx. 5-times greater for BL bcl-2 cells (5.0 micromol/l) than for BL SV2 cells (1.0 micromol/l). There was no significant increase in apoptosis after 24 h of treatment with oracin (1.0 micromol/l) in both cell lines. However, after 48 h from the removal of oracin in BL SV2 culture the levels of apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells increased to 20 and 37%, respectively. In contrast, BL bcl-2 cells treated in a similar manner showed only basal levels of apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells. Analysis of the cell cycle profiles showed a significant increase of S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle in both cell lines after 6 h of drug treatment (1.0 micromol/l). The cells were arrested in G2/M phase of the cell cycle after 24 h, with no significant changes in cell viability. After 72 h, the viable BL SV2 cells were still in G2/M, however, the viability of this culture had fallen to approx. 5%. Flow cytometry analysis of the DNA content revealed the presence of a 'sub-G2' region, which represented the apoptotic cells. The BL SV2 cells died after 72 h while they were in the G2/M phase. Although the treated BL bcl-2 cells were similarly arrested in the G2/M phase, they nevertheless remained with a relatively high viability (68%).
