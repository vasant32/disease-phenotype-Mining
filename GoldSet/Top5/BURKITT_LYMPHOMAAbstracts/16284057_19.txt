 BACKGROUND: We conducted a phase II study to evaluate in 72 adult patients the efficacy of the intensive LMB chemotherapy regimen, previously reported by the Société Française d'Oncologie Pédiatrique for children with Burkitt lymphoma and L3 acute lymphoblastic leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment began with a prephase (low-dose steroids, vincristine and cyclophosphamide), except in patients with low tumor burden. Group A (resected stage I and abdominal stage II disease) received three courses of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone. Group B (not eligible for groups A or C) received five courses of chemotherapy comprising high-dose methotrexate, infusional cytarabine and intrathecal (IT) methotrexate. Group C (patients with central nervous system and/or bone marrow involvement with < 30% of blast cells) received eight courses containing intensified high-dose methotrexate, high-dose cytarabine, etoposide and triple IT injections. RESULTS: The 2 year event-free survival and overall survival rates for the 72 patients were 65% and 70%, respectively. Age > or = 33 years and high lactate dehydrogenase value were associated with a shorter survival. No response to COP was also associated with a poor outcome in group B. CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced-stage Burkitt lymphoma, including those with bone marrow and/or central nervous system involvement, can be cured with a short-term intensive chemotherapy regime tailored to the tumor burden.
