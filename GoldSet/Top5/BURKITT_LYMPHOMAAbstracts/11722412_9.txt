Two elderly men with stage IV mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) rapidly developed a leukaemic phase with unusually high blast counts that proved fatal. One lymph node biopsy showed diffuse MCL, the other blastic morphology. In addition to t(11;14), there were t(8;14) and t(1;19) in case 1 and dup(8)(q24q13) in case 2. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed genomic fusion of IgH/MYC genes in case 1 and an extra copy of C-MYC gene in case 2. The genomic alteration of C-MYC oncogene is probably implicated in the blastic transformation and aggressive behaviour of the disease.
