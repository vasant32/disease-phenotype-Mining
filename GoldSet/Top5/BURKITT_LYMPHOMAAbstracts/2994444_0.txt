This report is a retrospective review of early studies (1965-70) on the cytology and short-term tissue culture of fresh specimens from 1643 patients under investigation for cancer at the University College Hospital, Ibadan. A total of 580 specimens were positive for malignant cells. The technical procedures are described in some detail and were found to be particularly useful as aid to laboratory diagnosis of 310 childhood tumours. The relative frequency of Burkitt's lymphoma, retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma and Wilm's tumour in the series was 20:1:1:0.5 respectively. Adoption of the technique as part of routine diagnostic service of teaching hospitals of developing countries is recommended.
