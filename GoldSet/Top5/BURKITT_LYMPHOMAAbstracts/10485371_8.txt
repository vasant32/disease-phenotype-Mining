We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to investigate the presence of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the serum of patients developing post-transplant lymphomas. Serum IL-10 was detected in 14 out of 19 cases with a lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease, with higher values being observed in patients who had developed a lymphoma within the first few months post-transplantation, and who had an aggressive form of the disease. Eleven out of the 14 patients in whom IL-10 was detected had Epstein Barr virus-positive tumors. And 11 out of 14 patients died of lymphomas. In most of the patients who had detectable IL-10 at the time of diagnosis of the lymphoma, the IL-10 had not been present previously, but it was found in the serum of 7 out of 9 dialysis patients, and in 8 out of 17 stable transplant patients. We conclude that IL-10 plays a role in the development of the more severe forms of post-transplant lymphomas, and may be secreted by tumor cells. However. data from patients with chronic renal failure or patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy must be treated with caution.
