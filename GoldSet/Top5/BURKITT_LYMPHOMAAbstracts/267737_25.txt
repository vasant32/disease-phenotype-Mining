The growth inhibitory effect of human leukocyte and fibroblast interferons was tested in vitro. The effect of fibroblast interferon was more pronounced on osteosarcoma cells and the effect of leukocyte interferon was more pronounced on lymphoid cells. This suggests that the capacity of interferon to inhibit cell growth is, in some measure, tissue specific.
