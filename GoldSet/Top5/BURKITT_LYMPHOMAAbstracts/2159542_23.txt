The terminal proteins TP1 and TP2 are putative products of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genes expressed during the latent cycle of the virus. They are predicted to code for 53- and 40-kilodalton integral membrane proteins. We used the baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus as an expression vector to produce TP1 in large amounts in insect cells. The DNA sequences used to express TP1 originated from a TP1 cDNA derived from an M-ABA/CBL1 cDNA library. Rabbit antisera raised against procaryotic TP1 fusion proteins recognized a monomer and a dimer of the recombinant TP1 protein in the infected insect cells. Immunofluorescence studies of living insect cells showed that the recombinant protein is located in the plasma membrane. The insect cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus producing TP1 provided a test system to screen human antisera for TP1 antibodies. A total of 168 human EBV-positive and EBV-negative antisera were studied. TP1 antibodies were detected only in sera from nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients (16 out of 42). Rabbit antiserum raised against the recombinant TP1 protein expressed in the baculovirus system specifically recognized a protein of about 54 kilodaltons in the lymphoblastoid cell lines M-ABA and M-ABA/CBL1 and in the Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines BL18 and BL72. This protein could be located in the total membrane fraction of M-ABA cells and is upregulated by treating the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate.
