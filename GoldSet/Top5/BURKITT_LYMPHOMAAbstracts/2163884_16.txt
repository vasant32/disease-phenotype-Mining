We have isolated and sequenced 3 human DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) partial cDNA clones from a HeLa carcinoma cell cDNA library. Two clones were identical to an internal fragment of HeLa topo II cDNA. The third clone, CAA5, had a different and novel sequence which shared significant nucleotide (62%) and predicted peptide (70%) homologies with a region of the HeLa topo II cDNA. Our results suggest that HeLa cells express at least two homologous forms of DNA topoisomerase II. The new HeLa topo II homologue is discussed in relation to topo II isoenzymes recently described in a Burkitt lymphoma and other cell lines.
