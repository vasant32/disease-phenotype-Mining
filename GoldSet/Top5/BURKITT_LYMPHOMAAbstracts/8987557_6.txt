New water-soluble fullerene carboxylic acids (1 and 2) derived from C60 and C70 fullerenes, respectively, were examined for photocytotoxicity toward Raji cells (B lymphocyte). These compounds did not show any photocytotoxic effect even at 50 microM, while pheophorbide a showed significant photocytotoxicity at 0.5 microM. Therefore, fullerene derivatives derived from C60 and C70 would not be practical agents for photodynamic therapy.
