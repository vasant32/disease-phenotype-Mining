The control of immune responses by sex hormones is well documented but the effect of sex hormones on lymphoid cell subsets is poorly understood. We have investigated the expression of receptors for androgens (AR), estradiol (ER) and progesterone (PR) by human cell lines of the B lymphocyte lineage and by murine myeloma or hybridomas. AR, ER and PR were determined by cytosol and nuclear binding assays. Eleven human lymphoblastoid cell lines obtained by in vitro infection of blood or tonsil B cells with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) B95, did not express AR or ER. Similarly, 10 Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines were AR, ER and PR negative with the exception of the pre-B RAJI cells which bear AR. Among 13 cell lines derived from patients with multiple myeloma none expressed AR but five were found to bear ER (20-164 fmol/mg DNA or 5-10 fmol/mg protein). Four of the latter group also bear PR (86-450 fmol/mg DNA). Two mouse hybridomas out of seven tested were ER and PR positive. The MOPC 315 myeloma expressed ER but not PR. The possible functional role of these sex hormone binding sites in cell proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion deserves further investigation.
