Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine which is necessary for the differentiation of activated B cells and growth of early haemopoietic progenitors. It is used for ex-vivo expansion of myeloid progenitors in the setting of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Expression of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) was examined in six fresh Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell preparations and 12 BL cell lines by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry (FCM). Inducibility of IL-6R mRNA expression by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was studied by comparing two uninfected cell lines with the same cell lines infected by EBV The phenotype of the BL cells lines was analysed by FCM and by proliferation assays in the presence of anti-IgM antibodies. None of the fresh BL cells expressed the IL-6 receptor. The BL cell lines expressed varying degrees of IL-6R mRNA and protein. In vitro infection of EBV-negative BL cell lines resulted in up-regulation of IL-6R mRNA. There was no proliferative response of the BL cell lines to IL-6, including the cells that expressed the receptor. Compared to uninfected BL cell lines, EBV-infected cell lines and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) showed a weaker or no response to anti-IgM antibodies, indicating a more mature phenotype of these cells. We conclude that the IL-6 receptor is not expressed in fresh childhood BLs, but only in BL cell lines. EBV infection in vitro leads to an up-regulation of IL-6R mRNA but not to increased proliferation. This makes growth stimulation of contaminating BL cells in the setting of autologous BMT unlikely.
