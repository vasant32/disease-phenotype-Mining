A series of tubercidin (7-deazaadenosine) analogues of 2-5A of the general formula p5'(c7A)2'p[5'(c7A)-2'p]n5'(c7A) (n = 0-5) were prepared by lead ion catalyzed polymerization of the 5'-phosphoroimidazolidate of tubercidin. Through the corresponding imidazolidates, these oligonucleotide 5'-monophosphates were converted to the 5'-triphosphates. All reported structures were corroborated by enzyme digestion and 1H or 31P nuclear magnetic resonance. When evaluated for its ability to bind to the 2-5 A-dependent endonuclease of mouse L cells, the tubercidin analogue of trimeric 2-5A, namely, ppp5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A), and the corresponding tetramer were bound as effectively as 2-5A itself; nonetheless, it and the corresponding tetramer, ppp5'-(c7A)2'p5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A), failed to stimulate the 2-5A-dependent endonuclease as judged by its inability to inhibit translation in extracts of mouse L cells programmed with encephalomyocarditis virus RNA and to give rise to ribosomal RNA cleavage in the same cell system under conditions where 2-5A showed activity at 10(-9) M. The trimer, ppp5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A), was an antagonist of 2-5A action in the L cell extract. In the lysed rabbit reticulocyte system, both the trimeric and tetrameric tubercidin 2-5A analogues were bound to the 2-5A-dependent endonuclease as well as 2-5A, but in this case, the tetramer triphosphate, ppp5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A), was just as potent an inhibitor of translation as 2-5A tetramer triphosphate. Moreover, this inhibition was prevented by the established 2-5A antagonist p5'A2'p5'A2'p5'A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
