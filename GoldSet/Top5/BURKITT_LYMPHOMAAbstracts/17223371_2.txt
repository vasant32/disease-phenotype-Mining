As a new model to elucidate molecular mechanisms in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) activation, we tested the tetracycline-inducible (Tet-On)/BZLF1-oriP plasmid system in Raji cells. Cells transfected with this Tet-On plasmid did not activate EBV by doxycycline and surprisingly EBV latency was disrupted with large amounts of BMRF1 protein (EA-D) being accumulated in the cells. Brilliant EA-D fluorescence was markedly condensed in small sized cells, intra-cellular vesicles, and extra-cellular particles. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the extra-cellular particles to be covered with a membrane. EA-D molecules of 58, 50, 48, and 44kDa were expressed in the cells. The high (58 and 50kDa) and low (48 and 44kDa) EA-D molecules appeared in the early and late stages, respectively. Low EA-D molecules were detected mostly in EA-D positive cells separated into the heaviest density layer of a discontinuous Percoll gradient. Such molecules could be created from high EA-D molecules by protein phosphatase treatment. The EA-D molecules that appeared similar were detected in EBV-activated P3HR-1 and Akata cells. Several hypotheses concerning the accumulation of EA-D molecules of various polymorphic forms and their phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in this model system are presented, with possible biological and clinical relevance.
