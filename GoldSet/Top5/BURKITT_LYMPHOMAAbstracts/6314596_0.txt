An Epstein-Barr virus-negative lymphoma cell line, THP-2, was established from a Burkitt's lymphoma taken from a Japanese patient. THP-2 cells grew in single cell suspension with a doubling time of 24 hr; the cells carried surface-bound mu-lambda immunoglobulins and formed rosettes with IgG antibody-coated ox erythrocytes. THP-2 cells expressed B1, common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (J5) and Ia-like antigens of their surface as defined by monoclonal antibodies. Epstein-Barr virus-associated nuclear antigen (EBNA) was not detected. The cell line THP-2 has been maintained for over 5 years. Among the markers examined, only common ALL antigen has been present on the cell surface of THP-2 for these 5 years.
