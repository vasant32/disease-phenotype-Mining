Six cases of jaw lymphoma occurring in Middle East children between 1971-1976 are reported. While the histological and radiological appearances of the tumours were suggestive of a diagnosis of Burkitt's tumour, the Middle East tumour failed to respond clinically to treatment which is effective against Burkitt's lymphoma. It is believed that these tumours may constitute a separate clinical entity. The identification of the initiating agent should be a matter of urgency, for treatment at present is invariably unsuccessful.
