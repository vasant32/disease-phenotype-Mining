Primary cardiac lymphoma is a rare clinical entity with poor prognosis and delayed diagnosis is often due to variable and non-specific clinical presentation. The case of an elderly male is reported with multiple co-morbidities, who had undergone a spinal laminectomy two weeks prior to presentation, later presented to the emergency room (E.R.) with acute chest pain, dyspnea and hypoxemia. A diagnosis of intracardiac thrombus was made, based on the clinical picture and echocardiography findings but per-operatively, he was found to have an extensive, non-resectable cardiac tumor.
