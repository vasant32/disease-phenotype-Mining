We report the case of a 12-year-old European boy presenting with an appendicular Burkitt's lymphoma. He complained of right lower abdominal pain mimicking acute appendicitis. Ultrasonography and abdominal CT showed an appendicular mass which features were strongly suspicious for malignancy. This case emphasizes the importance of medical imaging to characterize appendicular lesions and to select the surgical technique. Accurate diagnosis was obtained histologically on resected specimen.
