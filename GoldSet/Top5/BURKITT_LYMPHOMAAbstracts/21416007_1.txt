Burkitt's lymphoma is a highly aggressive mature B-cell neoplasm consisting of endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency-associated variants, sharing many morphologic and immunophenotypic features. It is characterized by a high proliferation rate and propensity for extranodal sites such as gastrointestinal tract and reproductive organs. Brief-duration, high-intensity chemotherapy regimens including aggressive central nervous system prophylaxis have had remarkable success in the treatment of this disease in the sporadic form, with very high complete remission rate and overall survival in adults. Although Burkitt's lymphoma is extremely chemosensitive, biologically targeted therapies should be developed, because current treatment options are suboptimal for patients with poor prognostic features or with relapsed disease.
