Experiments have been carried out to establish the relative position of the mouse Ig heavy chain locus and the c-myc oncogene. In mouse plasmacytoma with the typical rcpt(12;15) chromosome translocation the c-myc oncogene is juxtaposed to one of the heavy chain genes in a head-to-head orientation. Since the relative orientations of the c-myc locus and the Ig heavy chain gene cluster on the corresponding mouse chromosomes had not been settled, it was not known whether the rearranged c-myc gene is transposed to chromosome 12 or remains on chromosome 15. To decide which of the two alternatives is correct, we separated the translocation chromosomes by fluorescence-activated chromosome sorting. The separated chromosomal fractions were hybridized with myc-specific DNA probes corresponding to the first or second/third exons in a chromosome spot assay. The results presented here indicate that the c-myc gene in mouse plasmacytoma carrying the typical translocation, as in the human Burkitt lymphoma analogous translocation, transposes to the chromosome carrying the Ig heavy chain locus. These results also establish the orientations of the Ig heavy chain locus and the c-myc locus on their normal chromosomes.
