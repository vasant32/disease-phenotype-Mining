In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), early response to treatment is an important prognostic factor and drug resistance is a major cause of poor outcome. One of the most investigated resistance mechanisms is P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated multiple drug resistance (MDR). We analyzed P-gp using flow cytometry with monoclonal antibody JSB1 in a series of 118 children with ALL, 103 at diagnosis and 15 at relapse. Increased P-gp expression was found in 55 (53%) patients at diagnosis and in 11 (73%) at relapse. We also analyzed the bone marrow aspirate slides for early response to treatment in a central review. No correlation was found between P-gp and early response. Patients with T-ALL had higher P-gp levels than the others, 5.3% versus 1.0% (P = .002). We conclude that P-gp-mediated multiple drug resistance is not a factor in a slow response to ALL induction therapy.
