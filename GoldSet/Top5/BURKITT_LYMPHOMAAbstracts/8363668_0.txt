The authors report their experience on diagnosis of maxillo-facial Burkitt's lymphoma using needle aspiration and cytology. In all the 21 patients presenting a histological proved Burkitt's lymphoma, the diagnosis was done before with cytology. This method has a 100% sensibility. Thus, cytologic diagnosis of maxillo-facial Burkitt's lymphoma is very reliable. In tropical areas with little revenues and where Burkitt's lymphoma is frequent, needle aspiration and cytology need to be well known and used.
