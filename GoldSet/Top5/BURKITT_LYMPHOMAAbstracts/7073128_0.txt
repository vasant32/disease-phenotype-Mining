A teenage white male was recently evaluated for a rapidly enlarging mass in the right groin. Biopsy of the mass disclosed Burkitt's lymphoma. Aggressive therapy was instituted, including extirpative surgery, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Using these combined modalities, it was possible to eliminate the lymphoma. Unfortunately, severe pancytopenia and immunosuppression developed and the patient died of gram-negative sepsis. This disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any rapidly enlarging solid tumor in a young patient.
