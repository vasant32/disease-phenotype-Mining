In Burkitt's lymphoma, dental structures may provide the route for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in saliva to penetrate the jaws, thereby promoting tumor formation. In children, EBV could enter tooth sockets exposed following deciduous tooth loss and thereby contact jaw marrow lymphocytes stimulating neoplastic transformation. Marrow contact by EBV probably also occurs through carious teeth. Jaw tumors are rare in adults because their jaw marrow is no longer hematopoietic and so lacks the lymphoid substrate for the virus. In adults, jaw marrow lymphocytosis, as accompanies infectious mononucleosis and perhaps malaria, or which could develop around the roots of carious teeth having chronic periapical infection, could provide the substrate for EBV. EBV could then contact the jaw marrow lymphocytes when teeth are extracted and so favor jaw tumor development. Therefore, prevention of dental caries might reduce jaw tumor prevalence in Burkitt's lymphoma except among children ages 6-13 whose jaw marrow would unavoidably become infected by salivary EBV when the latter is present at the time of deciduous tooth loss.
