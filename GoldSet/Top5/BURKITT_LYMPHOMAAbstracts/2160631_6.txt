Rearrangements of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor (TCR) genes have been demonstrated in malignant lymphoid tumors of B and T cell origin. In Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia cells the bcr and c-abl genes are reorganized and transcripts composed of both genes are expressed. We analyzed the organization of bcr, immunoglobulin and TCR genes in malignant lymphomas. Our data show that in all B cell lymphomas analyzed the JH genes and in some cases also the J kappa genes were rearranged. In a Burkitt lymphoma and in a Kil lymphoma distinct rearranged TCR gamma fragments were detected, in a second Burkitt lymphoma two rearranged TCR beta gene fragments occurred together with a rearranged JH gene fragment. In two T cell lymphomas rearranged TCR beta genes were observed; one of these lymphomas also carried rearranged TCR gamma and JH genes. In Hodgkin's disease in 3 out of 7 cases rearranged immunoglobulin genes were detected. In 1 case, which was diagnosed as a follicular hyperplasia, rearranged JH and TCR gamma fragments appeared. In none of the analyzed lymphomas could bcr rearrangements be observed.
