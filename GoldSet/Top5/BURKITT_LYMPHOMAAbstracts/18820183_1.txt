There is paucity of information on childhood cancer from Sudan with the last studies published more than 20 years ago. This study aims to provide a current picture of childhood cancer in Sudan. Data was obtained from the hospital registry for the period May 1999 to June 2007 on all paediatric patients presenting to the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Oncology, University of Gezira, Wad Madani, Sudan. There were 322 children with cancer during this time period with a male:female ratio of 1.6:1. Lymphomas (111, 35%), leukaemia (83, 26%) and Wilms' tumour (43, 13%) were the three most common groups of tumours. Thirty percent of all lymphomas were Burkitt's lymphoma; 3.4% of all childhood cancer cases were nasopharyngeal carcinomas.
