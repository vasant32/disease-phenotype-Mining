Examination of P3HR-I cells (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] producer) persistently infected with the MAL strain of herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-I) suggested that only a few cells were actively producing a virus indistinguishable from HSV-I (MAL) despite the presence of immunofluorescent HSV-I antigens associated with the majority of cells. EBV-specific immunofluorescence was not altered in HSV-I persistently infected P3HR-I cells. HSV-I persistently infected cells, labelled for 72 h with 14C-thymidine, incorporated approx. 8% of the label into cell associated HSV-I DNA as resolved by caesium chloride gradients. Values greater than 8% of the total were suggested by hybridization of gradient fractions with 3H-HSV-I DNA. To determine whether the establishment of HSV persistent infections in Burkitt lymphoma derived cells was a general phenomenon, six strains of HSV-I (MAL, KOS, Patton, Syn R, BF and SYN V) and two strains of type 2 (333 and MS) were used to infect the P3HR-I and Raji (EBV non-producer) cell lines derived from Burkitt lymphomas. In P3HR-I cells, persistent infections were established with all strains of HSV-I but not with HSV-2. In Raji cells, persistent infections were established with all strains of HSV-I, except Syn V, and with both strains of HSV-2. No external support was required to maintain these infections.
