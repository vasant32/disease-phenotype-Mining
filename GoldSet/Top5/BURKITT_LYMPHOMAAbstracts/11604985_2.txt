BAT is a monoclonal antibody produced against membranes of Daudi cells that induces anti-tumor activity in mice against a variety of solid murine and human tumors, mediated by its immune stimulatory properties on murine and human lymphocytes. The present study analyzes the effect of BAT on leukemia/lymphoma using the BCL1 model of leukemia/lymphoma in BALB/C mice. BAT antibody binds to BCL1 leukemia cells and recognizes a 48 kDa protein similar to the antigen on Daudi cells. Mice inoculated with leukemia cells were treated either by direct BAT injections or by adoptive transfer of lymphocytes from BAT-injected mice. Administration of BAT monoclonal antibody was either once, on day 14, or daily on days 10-13 post tumor inoculation. A single injection of BAT resulted in reduction of peripheral blood tumor cells, however additional injections further decreased the tumor cell number reaching a 95-fold reduction on day 20 post tumor inoculation. Anti-tumor effect was also obtained when animals were injected with splenocytes from BAT-treated donor mice. A significant prolongation of survival of BAT-treated mice was observed although with no cure. The results of this study indicate that BAT might be used for reducing the tumor burden in leukemia for immunotherapy and in combination with other treatment modalities.
