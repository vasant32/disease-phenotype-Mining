Spin-trapping and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy were used to detect free radicals generated during light exposure of lymphoma cells sensitized in vitro by metallotetrasulfophthalocyanines (Al-PcS4 and Zn-PcS4). 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide (DMPO) and alpha-phenyl-beta-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) were used as spin-trapping agents. Hydroxyl radical spin-adducts were detected under conditions of both extracellular and intracellular photosensitization. In addition, organic radicals of different origin and/or variable yields were trapped, depending on the photosensitization conditions and the spin-trap used. For comparison, analogous experiments were carried out with another tumor-localizing photosensitizer, Photofrin II.
