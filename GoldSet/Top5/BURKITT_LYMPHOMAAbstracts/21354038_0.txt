 OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study were to recruit and present epidemiological, clinical, histological and therapeutic aspects of primary lymphomas of the urogenital tract in Cameroon. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This was a retrospective study over a 10-year period (1999-2008) done on clinical records of the Urological Unit of the Yaounde Central Hospital. From these records, we noted the age and the sex of the patients, their clinical presentation and histological aspect. The patients were treated by surgical resection and chemotherapy. RESULTS: Twenty cases were recruited between this period of the study. The age of the patients varied from 6 to 60 years with a mean age of 35 years. There were 19 men and one woman. Eighteen cases involved the testis, one case the kidney and one penile involvement. On histology, there were 19 cases of Burkitt's lymphoma and one case of large B cell lymphoma involving the penis. Three patients had positive syphilis serology and two other were HIV positive. All the patients in this series had a complete remission after treatment but the tumour recurs after 6 to 9 months. CONCLUSION: Burkitt's lymphoma is the first malignant tumour of the testis in Cameroonian. Unfortunately, patients consult late, there are no supports for the treatment and this will lead to a poor prognosis.
