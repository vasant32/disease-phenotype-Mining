The xenogeneic mixed lymphocyte culture between murine splenocytes and mitomycin-treated human lymphoblastoid Daudi cells has been shown to result in a ten-fold increase of the autologous rosette forming cells (AFRC). The supernatant from Daudi cultures enhances the ARFC population to a similar extent, in addition it induces a mitogenesis comparable to that of Con A or LPS. However these two lectins do not modify the ARFC number. Thus Daudi supernatant acts specifically on a particular subset of lymphocytes. The mechanism of induction of the ARFC is discussed.
