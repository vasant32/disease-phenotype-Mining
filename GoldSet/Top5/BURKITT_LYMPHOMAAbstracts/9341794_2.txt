Major regulators of programmed cell death, or apoptosis, are the members of the bcl-2 gene family. Recently, we reported that surface(s) IgM triggering of the human B lymphoma cell line BL-41 led to strong induction of bax-alpha, a death-promoting member of the bcl-2 family, and subsequently to induction of apoptosis, suggesting a potential regulatory role of bax-alpha in sIgM-mediated cell death. In contrast, apoptosis-resistant subclones of this cell line showed only weak bax-alpha expression, which was not inducible by sIgM cross-linking. In this study, we were able to demonstrate the functional significance of this observation. We stably transfected bax-alpha into a BL-41 subline resistant against sIgM-mediated apoptosis. Several bax-alpha overexpressing clones could be selected, which all showed enhanced sensitivity for sIgM-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, no sensitive clone could be identified in a large number of mock controls. This clearly indicates that induction of bax-alpha is a critical regulatory step, which sensitizes B cells for sIgM-mediated apoptosis.
