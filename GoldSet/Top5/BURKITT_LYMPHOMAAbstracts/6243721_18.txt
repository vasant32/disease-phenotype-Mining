Sixteen lymphoid cell lines were derived from patients with undifferentiated lymphoma of Burkitt's or non-Burkitt's type. They were obtained directly from tumor biopsies, from serous effusions, or from bone marrow. In 10 of the cell lines, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen (EBNA) was undetectable; the remaining 6 lines were EBNA-positive (EB-pos). Of the 16 lines, 15 were aneuploid, with detectable chromosome "14q+ markers (11 had +8;14 translocations). These 15 lines, which included the EBNA-negative (EB-neg) lines, were believed to be of tumor cell origin. The remaining line consisted predominantly of diploid cells derived from normal lymphocytes, but some cells of tumor origin were present. Four EB-pos cell lines derived from EB-neg tumors had an aneuploid karyotype consistent with an origin from tumor cells (including no.8;14 translocation in two), which suggested that either tumor cells were infected with EBV in vitro or a tiny fraction of EB-pos tumor cells (or potential tumor cells) present in vivo gave rise to the predominant cell of the line. EB-neg B-cell lines and EB-pos cell lines established from undifferentiated lymphomas differed greatly. EB-neg lines had consistently smaller electronic mean cell volumes and narrow-angle light scatter than did EB-pos lines. This finding correlated with a lower nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio in EB-pos lines. EB-neg lines also had higher saturation cell densities than did EB-pos lines under standard culture conditions. The data indicate either that EBV influences the morphologic and physiologic characteristics of lymphoid cell lines or that EB-neg B-cell lines and EB-pos cell lines are derived ultimately from different lymphocyte subpopulations or that both may apply.
