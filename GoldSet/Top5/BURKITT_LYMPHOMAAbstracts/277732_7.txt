Fifteen spontaneous immunocytomas originating in the ileocecal lymph nodes of Lou/C/Wsl rats were studied by means of electron microscopy. The histology was characteristic, the tumor being formed by an accumulation of large, rounded cells with slightly eccentric ovoid nuclei, large nucleoli, and finely condensed chromatin along the nuclear walls; the cytoplasma was rich in polyribosomes. The appearance of the rough endoplasmic reticulum was apparently the same whether or not the tumor was secretory. Its development varied from one cell to another, and in only a small proportion of cells did it attain any considerable volume. In all the tumors examined, we noted the presence of intracisternal A-particles. In its morphology, the rat immunocytoma resembled the plasmacytomas induced in mice, and it also resembled certain human tumors such as Burkitt's lymphoma.
