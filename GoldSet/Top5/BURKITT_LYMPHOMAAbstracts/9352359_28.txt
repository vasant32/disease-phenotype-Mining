Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is the only viral protein consistently expressed in all malignancies associated with EBV and there is now convincing evidence to suggest that EBNA1 is not recognized by MHC class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). The lack of recognition of EBNA1 has been attributed to a cis-acting inhibitory effect of glycine-alanine repetitive (G-Ar) sequences on the endogenous processing of this antigen through the class I pathway. In the present study we have explored the possibility of targeting EBNA1 through an alternative mechanism using the MHC class II pathway. Using purified EBNA1 protein, we demonstrate here that CD4+ CTL can efficiently recognize EBV-transformed B cells and Burkitt's lymphoma cells following exogenous sensitization with this antigen, and this immune recognition is not affected by the G-Ar domain within EBNA1. Analysis of the processing mechanism revealed that intracellular loading of class II molecules with an EBNA1 epitope occurs through an HLA-DM-independent pathway. These results highlight a novel mechanism for immune recognition of EBNA1 and also demonstrate that the G-Ar-mediated protection from processing can be overridden if this antigen is presented through the class II pathway.
