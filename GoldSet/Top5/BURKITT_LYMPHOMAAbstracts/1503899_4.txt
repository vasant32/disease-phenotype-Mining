We studied the effects of ICRF-154 in combination with 11 anticancer agents on four human leukaemia cell lines. Cells were incubated for 3 days in the presence of two drugs (ICRF-154 and one other), and cell growth inhibition was determined by MTT assay. Effects of drug combinations at the ID50 level were analysed using the isobologram method (Steel). In the lymphoblastic leukaemia cell lines, MOLT-3, HSB, and B-ALL, supra-additive effects were observed for ICRF-154 in combination with amsacrine, bleomycin, doxorubicin, and etoposide. Additive effects were observed for its combinations with cisplatin, CPT-11, cytosine arabinoside, 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C, and vincristine. Sub-additive to protective effects were observed in combination with methotrexate. In an erythroleukaemia cell line, K-562, no drug showed supra-additive effects with ICRF-154, while sub-additive to protective effects were observed for ICRF-154 in combination with cisplatin and methotrexate. The other drugs showed additive effects with ICRF-154. These results indicate that the combined effects of ICRF-154 with other agents vary, depending on the cell line. Against lymphoid malignancies, ICRF-154 would be advantageous when administered simultaneously with many anticancer agents. Of such agents, amsacrine, bleomycin, doxorubicin, and etoposide are the most suitable, while methotrexate is least suitable for such combined treatment.
