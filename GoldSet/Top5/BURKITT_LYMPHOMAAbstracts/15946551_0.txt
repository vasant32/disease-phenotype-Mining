 OBJECTIVE: To clone IgHV genes from childhood B-ALL cells and identify CTL epitopes deduced from IgHV gene. METHODS: Seven IgHV gene families were respectively amplified by PCR and directly sequenced for 37 childhood B-ALL cases. Bioinformatics were applied for analyzing characteristics of sequences available and predicting HLA-A*0201 molecule-binding nonapeptides derived from IgHV. The predicted nonapeptide QLVQSGAEV was synthesized and its binding affinity to T2 cells determined. CD8+ T cells from a healthy HLA-A*0201+ donor peripheral blood were stimulated repeatedly with QLVQSGAEV-loaded antigen presenting cells. RESULTS: IgHV gene rearrangements were identified in 37 B-ALL. Forty IgHV gene sequences available preferentially utilized V(H)4-59 and V(H)4-34 gene segments. Increased frequency (15.4%) of D7-27 in B-ALL IgHV was found compared to that reported for adult PBLs (P = 0.02); 20.0% DJ(H) junctions in B-ALL lacked non-encoding nucleotides, a frequency higher than that reported for adult PBLs (P = 0.02). 17.5% B-ALL IgHV contained < 2% replacement mutations. Forty B-ALL IgHV sequences acquired 12 high HLA-A*0201-binding nonapeptides, 10 (83.0%) peptides were located in frame region (FR)1 and 3. The synthesized peptide QLVQSGAEV up-regulated HLA-A*0201 expression 1.63 fold on the surface of T2 cells. The frequency of QLVQSGAEV-specific CD8+ T cells in a healthy HLA-A*0201+ donor peripheral blood increased from 1.6% and 82.6% after two-round and 3-round stimulations, respectively. CONCLUSION: IgHV genes in childhood B-ALL are of germline characteristics. Their heavy chain framework regions contain HLA-A*0201-binding nonapeptides. These peptides are capable of inducing specific CD8+ T cells to activate and proliferate.
