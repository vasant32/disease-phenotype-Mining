A novel aptamer biosensor for cancer cell assay has been reported on the basis of ultrasensitive electrochemical detection. Cancer cell capturing is first accomplished via aptamer-aided recognition, and the cell-aptamer binding events then mediate an alkaline phosphatase-catalyzed silver deposition reaction which can be probed by electrochemical detection. Following biocatalytic silver deposition, an efficient amplification approach for sensitive electrochemical measurements is demonstrated, for cell detection with high sensitivity. Ramos cell are used as a model case, a typical biomarker of the acute blood cell cancer, Burkitt's lymphoma. The results reveal that the developed technique displays desirable selectivity in Ramos cell discrimination, and linear response range from 10 to 10 cells with a detection limit as low as 10 cells. Due to the simple procedures, label-free and electrochemistry based detection format, this technique is simple and cost-effective, and exhibits excellent compatibility with miniaturization technologies. The electrochemical cell detection strategy may create an intrinsically specific and sensitive platform for cancer cell assay and associated studies.
