Two patients with Burkitt's lymphoma presented with severe hypercalcemia, a previously unreported complication of this tumor. Roentgenograms and radionuclide scans showed multiple osteolytic lesions in both patients. Plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) was undetectable during the hypercalcemia phase. Chemotherapy was followed by rapid tumor lysis, hyperphosphatemia, phosphaturia and hypocalcemia. The hypocalcemic phase persisted for two weeks despite rapid normalization of serum phosphorus and renal function. Measurement of urinary cyclic AMP, an index of PTH action, indicated that parathyroid function had been suppressed by the hypercalcemia and remained suppressed for almost one week despite marked hypocalcemia.
