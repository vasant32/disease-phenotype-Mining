Primary CNS lymphomas are detected with increasing frequency in immunocompetent and immunodeficient persons. Primary involvement of the spinal roots has only rarely been reported. The unusual history is described of a patient with a primary spinal Burkitt's lymphoma initially presenting as an S1 syndrome showing lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF, leading to the misdiagnosis of meningoradiculitis. Repeated spinal MRI disclosed a spinal mass lesion and histological and immunohistological examination of the tumour confirmed the diagnosis of spinal Burkitt's lymphoma.
