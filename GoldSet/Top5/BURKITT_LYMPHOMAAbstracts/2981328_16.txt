A monoclonal antibody designated V3 was produced against a late protein associated with the Epstein-Barr virus-induced viral capsid antigen complex. The antibody reacted with discrete patches in the nuclei of infected cells as well as with virus particles, as shown by immunofluorescence and ultrastructural immunoperoxidase staining. The molecular weight of the protein precipitated by this monoclonal antibody was ca. 160,000. All anti-viral capsid antigen antibody-positive sera tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reacted with this purified protein. The synthesis of the antigen was inhibited by phosphonoacetic acid but was not affected by tunicamycin, indicating that this was a late nonglycosylated viral protein. No differences were noted between the protein isolated from the P3HR-1 and B-95-8 cell lines as determined by immunoprecipitation and peptide mapping. By isoelectric focusing, this protein had a pI on the basic side ranging from 7.5 to 9.0.
