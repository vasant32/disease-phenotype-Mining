The objective of this report is to present the results of the BFM group in the treatment of 41 children with non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma and acute B cell lymphoblastic leukemia according to the BFM 86 and 90 protocols. Forty-one children, between 2 and 16 years of age, were treated from November 1987 to October 1993. Of these, 25 were treated with the BFM 86 protocol (18 non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphomas and 7 acute B cell lymphoblastic leukemias) and the rest with the BFM 90 protocol (15 non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphomas and 1 acute B cell lymphoblastic leukemia). Complete remission was achieved in 97.5% of the patients. A relapse occurred in 12.5% of the cases. Currently, 80.4% remain in continuous complete remission and 17% have died. The 5 year actuarial survival rate of those treated with the BFM 86 and 90 protocols was 79% and 87%, respectively, and event free survival in the same period was 76% and 87%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the results obtained with the two treatment protocols.
