A monoclonal immunoglobulin, IgM-kappa, was detected in the serum of a patient with Burkitt's lymphoma. This rarely reported finding raises the possibility that undifferentiated neoplastic lymphoreticular cells in this disorder have the capacity to synthesize immunoglobulins. Gel-exclusion and ion-exchange column chromatography, as well as immunofixation, allowed for heavy- and light-chain characterization of the subtle monoclonal component.
