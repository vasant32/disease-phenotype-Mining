BACKGROUND: Rectal tumors are rare in childhood and among them malignant tumors are even less common. Only eight cases of primary rectal lymphomas were reported in children, with various presenting signs and histology. Burkitt's lymphomas are among these cases. CASE REPORT: A five-year-old child presented with hematochezia and unusual constipation. The rectal examination showed a voluminous intra rectal mass. Radiographic and pathologic examinations led to the diagnostic of Burkitt's lymphoma with medullary involvement. Complete remission was obtained after initial chemotherapy but a local relapse occurred and the child died eight months later. CONCLUSION: Hematochezia associated with unusual constipation impose a rectal examination. Early diagnosis of a rectal tumor may allow patients survival.
