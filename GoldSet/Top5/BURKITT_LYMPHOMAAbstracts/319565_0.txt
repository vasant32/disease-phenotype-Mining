A highly specific anti-human T lymphocyte serum (AHTS) was obtained by sequentially absorbing rabbit anti-human thymocyte serum (ATS) with human red cells, neutrophils, Burkitt's lymphoma cells (Daudi cells), liver, kidney and glutaraldehyde insolubilized human serum. The immunofluorescent staining revealed that the basement membrane of human renal glomeruli reacts with AHTS before being absorbed with kidney. Specificities of AHTS were studied by the cytotoxicity test, inhibition of PHA responses, inhibition of E-resulting and immunofluorescent staining.
