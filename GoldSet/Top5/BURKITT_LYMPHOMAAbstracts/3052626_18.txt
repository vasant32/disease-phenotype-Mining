Thirty-eight patients (median age, 21 years) with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) (17 patients), acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL) (18 patients), chronic myelogenous leukemia (two patients), and refractory anemia received allogeneic bone marrow transplants from HLA-identical sibling donors or a one-antigen-mismatched brother (one patient) after a preparatory regimen consisting of fractionated total body irradiation and high-dose VP 16-213 (60 to 70 mg/kg body weight). Of the 33 patients with acute leukemia who received grafts from HLA-identical donors, three patients with ANLL received transplants in first remission and one patient with standard-risk ALL received a graft while in second remission. All other patients were in more advanced stages of their disease or exhibited other high-risk features. At the time of analysis, 20 of the 33 patients were alive, with 19 of them remaining in continued complete remission for 6 to 35 months (median, 18 months). The 3-year actuarial disease-free survival rate of 56.6% +/- 9.7% (SE) and the actuarial relapse rate of 11.9% +/- 6.8% (SE) demonstrate that the combination of fractionated total body irradiation and high-dose VP 16 is an effective mode of therapy in patients with advanced leukemias. Preliminary experience cautions against the use of VP 16 instead of cyclophosphamide in any clinical situation carrying an increased risk of graft rejection because the immunosuppressive potency of VP 16 is largely untested but may be inferior to that of cyclophosphamide.
