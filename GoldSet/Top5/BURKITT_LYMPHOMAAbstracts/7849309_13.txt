Mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) provide a model system to examine the in vivo homing, engraftment, and growth patterns of normal and malignant human hematopoietic cells. The relation between leukemic cell growth in this model and the treatment outcome in patients from whom cells were derived has not been established. Leukemic cells from 42 children with newly diagnosed high-risk B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia were inoculated intravenously into CB.17 SCID mice. Mice were killed at 12 weeks or when they became moribund as a result of disseminated leukemia. All mice were necropsied and subjected to a series of laboratory studies to assess their burden of human leukemic cells. Twenty-three patients whose leukemic cells caused histopathologically detectable leukemia in SCID mice had a significantly higher relapse rate than the 19 patients whose leukemic cells did not (estimated 5-year event-free survival: 29.5% v 94.7%; 95% confidence intervals, 11.2% to 50.7% v 68.1% to 99.2%; P < .0001 by log-rank test). The occurrence of overt leukemia in SCID mice was was a highly significant predictor of patient relapse. The estimated instantaneous risk of relapse for patients whose leukemic cells caused overt leukemia in SCID mice was 21.5-fold greater than that for the remaining patients. Thus, growth of human leukemic cells in SCID mice is a strong and independent predictor of relapse in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
