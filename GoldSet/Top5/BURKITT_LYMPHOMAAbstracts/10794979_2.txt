PURPOSE: To determine the frequency and to study anatomic and clinical features of malignant tumors of the eye and adnexa. METHODS: A retrospective (1962-1990) and prospective (1990-1992) study of 164 medical records of patients with histopathologic confirmation of malignant tumors of the eye and adnexa. All the patients received a conventional ophthalmological examination and underwent surgical biopsy. Histopathologic examinations were performed for a large part at the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Iowa and for a small part at the Department of Histopathology, University Hospital of Kinshasa. RESULTS: There were 99 (60%) male and 65 (40%) female for a sex ratio of 1.5: 1. The mean age of patients was 24.6 +/- 21.4 years. Epibulbar (35%) and intraocular (33%) tumors were the most frequent, followed by orbital tumors (20%). Epidermoid carcinoma and retinoblastoma were the most common histologic forms, representing respectively 33.5% and 31.7% of all malignant tumors of the eye and adnexa. They occurred especially in adults between 20 and 60 years for the first and in children below 5 years for the second. Metastatic tumors accounted for 9.7% of all cancers of the eye and adnexa. Kaposi's angiosarcoma was encountered in 3.6% of cases and in 3% it was associated with AIDS. Burkitt's lymphoma was seen in 3% of cases, basal cell carcinoma as well as in situ carcinoma in 2.4% of cases. Malignant lymphoma and adenocarcinoma both accounted for 1.8% of all cases of cancers of the eye and adnexa while adenoid cystic carcinoma, liposarcoma as well as rhabdomyosarcoma accounted for 1.2% of all cases. Other types of tumors were seen in very small proportion. CONCLUSION: Our results were similar to those of other studies in Africa and were different from those of European and American studies.
