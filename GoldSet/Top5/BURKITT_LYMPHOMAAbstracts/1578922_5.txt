From February 1986 to January 1991 the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) treated 2404 children or adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on immunophenotype (T-, B-, Pre-B, or Early pre-B-cell), age, and leukocyte count based treatment protocols (ALinC 14, T-cell 3, B-cell and infant leukemia studies). The immunophenotypic subgroups comprised 78.9% B-precursor cell, 15.1% T-cell, 2.0% B-cell, and 4% infant ALL. Patients with B-progenitor cell ALL were stratified by age and leukocyte count and randomized to receive induction therapy comprised of vincristine, prednisone, and asparaginase with triple intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate, hydrocortisone, cytarabine), followed by intensification with moderate-dose MTX (Regimen A), moderate-dose MTX plus asparaginase (Regimen B), moderate-dose MTX plus cytarabine given early (Regimen C), or moderate-dose MTX plus cytarabine given over the first 16 months of therapy (Regimen D). Continuation therapy comprised mercaptopurine and methotrexate with vincristine plus prednisone pulses. Central nervous system preventive treatment was continued for two years. Patients with T-cell or B-cell ALL or infants less than 1 yr old were treated on individual very intensive multiagent therapy protocols. The 4-year event-free survival for all patients was 66.4% +/- 2.4%; B-precursor ALL approximately 72%, T-ALL approximately 50%, B-ALL approximately 60%, and infants less than 1 yr old approximately 16.5%. We conclude that about two-thirds of newly diagnosed children with ALL can be cured with this approach which spares the majority of children exposure to alkylating agents, anthracyclines, epipodophylotoxins, and irradiation, diminishing the risks of serious acute and late effects.
