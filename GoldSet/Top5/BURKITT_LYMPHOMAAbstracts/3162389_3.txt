Complete or partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome #1 was observed in six patients with malignant disorders. Four patients suffered from hematologic diseases (two cases of refractory anemia with excess of blasts and one case each of acute myeloblastic leukemia and Burkitt lymphoma), and two had solid tumors (retinoblastoma and Ewing's sarcoma). In all cases the excess material included the distal part of chromosome #1. Such material was translocated to chromosomes #16 (three patients), #3, #9, and Y (one patient each), and this was accompanied by additional cytogenetic changes in five of the six patients. The present and other previously published observations support the hypothesis of the localization of genes responsible for malignant growth in the distal segments of chromosome #1.
