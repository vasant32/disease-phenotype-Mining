We have extended the use the aptamer-conjugated nanoparticles for the collection and detection of multiple cancer cells. The aptamers were selected using a cell-based SELEX strategy in our laboratory for cancer cells that, when utilized in this method, allow for the selective recognition of the cells from complex mixtures including fetal bovine serum samples. Aptamer-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles were used for the selective targeting cell extraction, and aptamer-conjugated fluorescent nanoparticles were employed for sensitive cellular detection. Employing both types of nanoparticles allows for selective and sensitive detection not possible by using the particles separately. Fluorescent nanoparticles amplify the signal intensity versus a single fluorophore label resulting in improved sensitivity. In addition, aptamer-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles allow for extraction and enrichment of target cells not possible with other separation methods. Fluorescent imaging and a microplate reader were used for cellular detection to demonstrate the wide applicability of this methodology for medical diagnostics and cell enrichment and separation.
