The tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in negative growth control, including growth arrest and apoptosis. Interferons (IFNs) are capable of modulating a variety of cellular responses, including apoptosis. In this study, we have evaluated the influence of gamma- and alpha-interferon (IFN) on wild-type (wt) p53-induced apoptosis using a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BL41, transfected with a temperature-sensitive p53 construct, gamma-IFN, but not alpha-IFN, was found to protect cells from wt p53-induced apoptosis. The gamma-IFN-dependent protection was due neither to down-regulation of p53, nor to the p53-induced genes, p21 (WAF-1) and bax, nor to up-regulation of bcl-2 or bcl-xL. Expression of the proto-oncogene c-myc, implicated in the control of both proliferation and apoptosis, was not affected by gamma-IFN. We conclude that gamma-IFN can suppress p53-induced apoptosis, and that the cytokine microenvironment may be decisive in the cellular response to wt p53 expression.
