Burkitt's lymphoma is the commonest of the jaw tumours affecting children in some parts of the tropical Africa. In the Sudan, the tumour appears to be relatively uncommon and our study showed only 7 cases during a 5-year period from December 1975 through to December 1980. The clinical features, aetiology, histopathology and the treatment of the tumour are discussed and the literature briefly reviewed.
