The digestive tract is the principal site of the extranodal non Hodgkin lymphomas. The purpose of our work was to describe the epidemiology and the prognosis of gastro-intestinal lymphomas in Togo. It was about a retrospective study relating to 32 cases diagnosed in Togo during 20 years. The gastro-intestinal lymphomas are not very frequent affection in Togo accounting for 5.6% of cancers of the digestive tract and occurring at 37 years an average age with a sex-ratio H/F to 1.5. Histologically, the lymphomas of intermediate rank were most observed according to the classification of Working Formulation (62.6%), where in fact the MALT lymphomas of high rank of malignity prevailed according to the classification of Isaacson. Their preferential topography was the stomach (59%). The narrowness of our technical plate poses enormous diagnostic problems of these lymphomas.
