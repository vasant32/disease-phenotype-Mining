A procedure for cellular fractionation and preparation of plasma membrane from a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line is described. This procedure involves homogenization with a Polytron in buffered isotonic sucrose, and separation of cellular fractions by differential and isopycnic centrifugation in sucrose. The isolated plasma membrane fraction contains 44% of the cellular cholesterol, 50% of the ouabain-sensitive (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity, 43% of the gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activities and 16% of the phospholipid. This fraction contains only 3% of cellular protein and is contaminated with less than 4% of the total cellular activities of microsomal, lysosomal, mitochondrial, Golgi and soluble marker enzymes. The cholesterol : phospholipid molar ratio of the crude plasma membrane is 0.56. The membranes in this fraction are in the form of vesicles. Further purification of plasma membrane is achieved by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and results in a 25- to 30-fold enrichment of plasma membrane markers. Plasma membrane markers band in these gradients between 1.10 and 1.15 g/cm3. The distribution patterns in the cell fractions of 18 cellular constituents are quantitatively determined. Most constituents are found to distribute in a fashion consistent with the results obtained in other systems. Thymidine-5'-phosphodiesterase (phosphodiesterase I), esterase, nucleoside diphophatase and glucose-6-phosphatase, however, are shown to be poor markers of membrane fractions in this system. Lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination was used to identify several plasma membrane proteins which are exposed at the surface. After separation of labeled polypeptides by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, the predominant labeled protein was identified as the heavy chain of IgM. Several lesser labeled proteins were observed.
