Cytogenetic analysis of 26 non-Burkitt lymphomas having abnormal clones, revealed non-random involvement of certain chromosomes in numerical and structural changes. In some cases, chromosome structural abnormalities could be correlated with histopathology of the tumours. A combined analysis of cases in the present series, and from the literature, indicates that the most common aberrations in the lymphoproliferative disorders involve structural changes of chromosome 14.
