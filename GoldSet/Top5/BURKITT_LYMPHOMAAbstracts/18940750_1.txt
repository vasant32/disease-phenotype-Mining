Primary ovarian Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a rare neoplasm in adults. We report a 30-year-old woman diagnosed with primary bilateral ovarian BL. She presented features of a twisted ovarian cyst and underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The histopathologic evaluation yielded the diagnosis of BL and subsequently she received chemoimmunotherapy with CODOX-M-IVAC plus rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody).
