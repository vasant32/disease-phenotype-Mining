Plasmablastic lymphoma shares many morphologic features with plasmablastic plasma cell myeloma. The activation of MYC oncogene in these lymphomas may be an important pathogenetic element associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. We describe herein an elderly man with a plasmablastic lymphoid neoplasm displaying unique morphologic, cytogenetic and clinical features. This case might offer additional insights to the complex but fascinating topic of hybrid haemato-lymphoid neoplasms such as plasmablastic lymphoma-myeloma. In addition, the patient responded to the treatment with bortezomib. Newer antimyeloma agents such as bortezomib have shown promise in the treatment of these neoplasms and should further be explored for their therapy. Copyright Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
