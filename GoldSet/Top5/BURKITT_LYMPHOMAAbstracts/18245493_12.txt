EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) has oncogenic potential and is expressed in many EBV-associated malignancies. Although LMP1 is regarded as a potential tumor-associated antigen for immunotherapy and several LMP1-specific MHC class I-restricted CTL epitopes have been reported, little is known regarding MHC class II-restricted CD4 helper T-lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes for LMP1. The goal of the present studies was to determine whether MHC class II-restricted CD4 T-cell responses could be induced against the LMP1 antigen and to evaluate the antitumor effect of these responses. We have combined the use of a predictive MHC class II binding peptide algorithm with in vitro vaccination of CD4 T cells using candidate peptides to identify naturally processed epitopes derived from LMP1 that elicit immune responses against EBV-expressing tumor cells. Peptide LMP1(159-175) was effective in inducing HTL responses that were restricted by HLA-DR9, HLA-DR53, or HLA-DR15, indicating that this peptide behaves as a promiscuous T-cell epitope. Moreover, LMP1(159-175)-reactive HTL clones directly recognized EBV lymphoblastoid B cells, EBV-infected natural killer (NK)/T-lymphoma cells and naturally processed antigen in the form of LMP1+ tumor cell lysates presented by autologous dendritic cells. Because the newly identified epitope LMP1(159-175) overlaps with an HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitope (LMP1(159-167)), this peptide might have the ability to induce simultaneous CTL and HTL responses against LMP1. Overall, our data should be relevant for the design and optimization of T-cell epitope-based immunotherapy against various EBV-associated malignancies, including NK/T cell lymphomas.
