Resting Burkitt's lymphoma cells (Daudi) in culture are more sensitive targets for the antiproliferative activity of purified human fibroblast interferon than cells that are rapidly multiplying. Thus, interferon may be of significant clinical value in neoplasms involving stem cells and, after chemotherapy, in suppressing the reemergence of tumors.
