Unilateral ptosis is seen in a limited number of conditions such as Horner syndrome, cluster headache, trauma, tumor, stroke, old age, nerve injury, lacrimal gland tumor, temporal arteritis or disorders of the upper eyelid. The authors present a case of unilateral ptosis secondary to Burkitt lymphoma metastasis to brain with excellent response to chemotherapy and complete resolution of ptosis in a man with human immunodeficiency virus. This vignette emphasizes the importance of recognizing ptosis as an initial presentation of Burkitt lymphoma in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus under appropriate clinical settings.
