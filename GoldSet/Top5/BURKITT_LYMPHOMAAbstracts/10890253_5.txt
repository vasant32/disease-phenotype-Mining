Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) in children and adolescents represent about 10% of childhood cancers. Although the types of NHL commonly seen in this population are relatively limited to lymphoblastic lymphomas, Burkitt's and Burkitt-like lymphomas, and large cell lymphomas, correct diagnosis and classification are essential for optimal therapy. Careful handling of pathologic specimens, along with collection of proper materials for ancillary studies such as immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, or molecular studies, will aid the pathologist in reaching a correct diagnosis. Specific morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features of the commonly seen types of pediatric NHL are described.
