We have cloned and sequenced the translocated c-myc gene from the Burkitt's lymphoma CA46 cell line that carries a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 8 and 14. The breakpoint lies within the first intron of c-myc, so that the first noncoding exon of the gene remains on the 8q- chromosome. The second and third coding exons are translocated to the 14q+ chromosome into the switch region of C-alpha 1. The orientation of the c-myc gene with relationship to alpha 1 is 5' to 5', with directions of transcription in opposite orientation. DNA sequencing studies predict five changes in the amino acid sequence of the myc protein, two of which occur in a region within the second exon which is highly conserved in evolution. Southern blotting data indicate that the first exon of c-myc is rearranged 3' to 3' with the pseudo-epsilon gene. Because CA46 cells contain two rearranged mu genes, the translocation must have occurred after immunoglobulin rearrangement. The position of the breakpoint in CA46 occurs within a 20-base-pair region of the first intron of c-myc to which breakpoints have been mapped for two additional B-cell lymphomas with the t(8;14) translocation, ST486 and the Manca cell line. The region of the heavy chain locus to which c-myc has translocated is different in each case. Comparisons have been made of the levels of transcripts of the translocated c-myc gene in ST486 and CA46, where the gene is not associated with the heavy chain enhancer, with its expression in the Manca cell, in which it is. The c-myc gene is transcribed at similar levels in all three cases.
