AIMS: Because of the observation of an abundance of leukaemia/lymphoma cell microparticles in the bone marrow aspiration sample of a patient with Burkitt's leukaemia at diagnosis, the occurrence of this phenomenon in leukaemia/lymphoma samples with available immune phenotyping data was investigated retrospectively. METHODS: Flow cytometric immune phenotyping and spontaneous apoptosis analysis of the bone marrow mononuclear cell preparation of the index case were performed. Microparticles isolated form the bone marrow sample were also studied for the presence of leukaemia/lymphoma cell microparticles. List mode analysis of 225 cases of acute leukaemia or lymphoma with previously performed immune phenotyping was also carried out. RESULTS: The presence of leukaemia/lymphoma cell microparticles could be detected by flow cytometry and they were found to be different from apoptotic bodies. Leukaemia/lymphoma cell microparticles were released in all cases of mature B cell neoplasms studied, although this phenomenon was rare in precursor B cell disorders and acute myeloid leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: The generation of leukaemia/lymphoma cell microparticles in mature B cell neoplasms appears to be a common phenomenon. The pathogenesis and clinical implications must be investigated.
