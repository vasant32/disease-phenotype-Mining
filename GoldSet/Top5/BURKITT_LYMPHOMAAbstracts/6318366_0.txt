Twenty five cases of Burkitt's lymphoma in Thai children were diagnosed at the Department of Pediatrics, Siriraj Hospital during the period of 13 years (January 1969 to April 1982). Males were more affected than females with the ratio of 1.7:1. The age ranged from 2 to 11 years with the median age of 4-5 years. The most common clinical manifestations were abdominal mass associated with nausea vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, weight loss and generalized lymphadenopathy which occurred in 50-60% of cases. Additional symptoms and signs included anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, edema and pleural effusion. Jaw tumor was found in only 37.5% of the patients. Definite diagnosis depended on the characteristic starry sky appearance of the lymph node biopsy or section of abdominal mass. In advance cases, the tumor cells could be discovered in bone marrow aspiration, ascitic fluid pleural fluid and cerebrospinal fluid. The typical blast cells were detected in the peripheral blood in 4 cases. Antibody to Epstein-Barr virus could be detected in almost all cases with high titers in some cases. Most patients responded very well to local irradiation and chemotherapy with prednisolone plus cyclophosphamide and vincristine or methotrexate. However, relapse occurred rapidly and 80% of the patients died within 3 months after diagnosis with the median survival of only 1 month. Five cases expired early before any specific treatment. The main causes of death were disease, sepsis, excessive bleeding and hyperkalemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
