Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is a rare monoclonal proliferation of Blymphocytes and is classified as a poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma. Typically, Burkitt's lymphoma involves the jaw bones, but the orbit can also be involved. Burkitt"s lymphoma is seen, sporadically in India, and 3 cases of orbital Burkitt's lymphoma were diagnosed during the past 4 years. Three cases of acute proptosis in children are presented to us. The provisional clinical diagnosis was rhabdomyosarcoma and the histopathology revealed Burkitt's lymphoma. The fast growth rate, hematologic manifestations and the urgency of diagnosis are emphasized. We present 3 cases here and review prevailing concepts about Burkitt's lymphoma.
