A somatic cell hybrid line and its subclones obtained by fusing two Burkitt lymphoma lines (Raji and Namalwa) were examined for the expression of EBV-specific antigens both spontaneously and after induction. The hybrids retained spontaneous early antigen (EA) production at the level characteristic of Raji. Similarly the more permissive Raji pattern dominated the induction of EA by IUDR treatment or P3HR-1 virus superinfection. These findings accord with our previous results on independently derived Raji/Namalwa hybrids. Virus capsid antigen was induced in the hybrids by P3HR-1 virus superinfection though at a lower level than in the Raji parental cell.
