CD30 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. CD30 was originally described as a cell surface antigen on primary and cultured Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg cells. In this study, recombinant human CD30 ligand was expressed on the surface of CV-1/EBNA cells and tested for biologic activities on a variety of different CD30+ human lymphoma cell lines. CD30 ligand enhanced Ig secretion of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized, CD30+ lymphoblastoid B-cell lines, but not Burkitt lymphoma lines. Recombinant CD30 ligand enhanced proliferation of "T-cell-like" Hodgkin's disease-derived cell lines and an adult T-cell leukemia cell line, but not "B-cell-like" Hodgkin's disease-derived cell lines, CD30+, EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid B-cell lines, or CD30+ and EBV+ tumor B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines. In addition, CD30 ligand mediated reduction of proliferation and viability, by induction of cytolytic cell death, of CD30+, large-cell anaplastic lymphoma cell lines. Two new antibodies, M44 and M67, against the CD30 antigen demonstrated similar biologic activities to the CD30 ligand. Taken together, these data demonstrate pleiotropic biologic activities of the CD30 ligand on different CD30+ lymphoma cell lines and indicate that the CD30-CD30 ligand interaction might have a pathophysiologic role in Hodgkin's and some non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
