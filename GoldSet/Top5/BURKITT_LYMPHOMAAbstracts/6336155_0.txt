The xanthine derivative, Trental (pentoxifylline) was found to inhibit several human leukemic and lymphoma cell lines in tissue cultures. Optimal concentrations were less inhibitory for a normal B-lymphocyte cell line then for the neoplastic cell lines. In fact, small concentrations stimulated DNA synthesis in the normal cell line. Trental and beta-interferon appeared to be additive synergists at certain dosages. Possible mechanisms are discussed.
