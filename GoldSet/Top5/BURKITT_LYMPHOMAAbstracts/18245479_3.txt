Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) controls a wide spectrum of cellular processes. Deregulation of TGF-beta signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of many diseases including cancer and autoimmune diseases. TGF-beta signaling is generally mediated through intracellular signal transducers and transcription factors called Smads. Herein, we have identified the oncoprotein BCL6 as a transcriptional corepressor of tumor suppressor Smad4. BCL6 physically interacts with Smad3 and Smad4, disrupts the Smad-p300 interaction, and represses the transcriptional activity of Smad4. In accordance, B-cell lymphoma cells with a high expression level of BCL6 were found to be refractory to TGF-beta antiproliferative response, whereas knockdown of BCL6 expression in B-cell lymphoma cells partially restores the TGF-beta responses. This study provides strong evidence that overexpression of BCL6 contributes to TGF-beta resistance in B-cell lymphoma.
