Two new strategies for increasing tumor uptake have been investigated. First the effect of interleukin-2 (IL-2) on tumor uptake of 125I-Lym-1 antibody in nude mice was investigated. Secondly, the use of 67Cu-labeled Lym-1 was evaluated in patients. In nude mice implanted with Raji human lymphoma, a greater than 2-fold enhancement of tumor uptake of 125I-Lym-1 was observed after administration of PEG-interleukin-2 (PEG-IL-2). The macrocycle 1,4,8,11-tetraazacylcotetradecane-N,N',N",N"'-tetraacetic acid (TETA), synthesized specifically for copper chelation, has been conjugated to Lym-1 for 67Cu labeling of the monoclonal antibody (MoAb). There was no evidence for bone or normal marrow uptake and the residence time in the tumor was prolonged. Surprisingly, a dose of 4.4 mCi that was intended for imaging induced substantial tumor regression in a patient.
