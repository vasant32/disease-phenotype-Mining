The aim of the study was to analyse retrospectively the patient survival and mortality risk factors in renal transplant children at Edouard-Herriot hospital, Lyon. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and ninety four patients 0 to less than 18 years of age received a renal transplant between April 1987 and January 2002. We collected data concerning the age at transplantation, the mean duration of dialysis prior to transplantation, the type of donor (living related: LRD, or cadaver: CAD) as well as long term follow-up of all the patients. Eleven patients died during the study period and we collected mortality and morbidity factors. RESULTS: Mean age at transplantation was 9.5 years (range: 0.6-17.9 years); 16 children were transplanted before 2 years of age. Eighty six percent received a first graft, 10% a second graft, and 3% a third graft. One third of the patients had preemptive transplantation. The graft was carried out respectively from a LRD in 18% and from CAD in 82% of the cases. Eleven patients (5.7%) died during this period; four of them were transplanted twice. Death occurred within 2.4 years after transplantation (range: 2 days-6.3 years). Five of these deceased children developed an acute rejection episode treated with methylprednisolone pulses and OKT3 monoclonal antibodies. Four had a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and three required repeated surgery. The causes of death were bacterial infections (4/11), CMV infection (2/11), neurological involvement (2/11), Burkitt lymphoma (1/11) and unexplained sudden death (2/11). CONCLUSION: The main causes of deaths in renal transplant children are bacterial infections. The improvement in patient survival probably will come from both better preventive approach to nosocomial infections and a less aggressive immunosuppression.
