Daudi Burkitt's lymphoma cells, unlike other tumor cell lines, stimulate human T cells coexpressing the variable (V) region genes TCRG-V9 and V TCRD-V2 to proliferate and secrete lymphokines. Hybrids, derived by the fusion of Daudi cells with the human melanoma cell line MZ2-MEL 2.2, retain the morphology of melanoma cells. Unlike the parental melanoma cell line, these Daudi x MZ2-MEL 2.2 hybrids stimulate secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by CD4-positive Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T-cell clones. Whereas the stimulator phenotype of Daudi cells behaves as a dominant trait in Daudi x melanoma hybrids, the expression of B-cell differentiation markers is suppressed. Thus, the gamma/delta T-cell ligand expressed by Daudi cells behaves as a dominant tumor antigen in Daudi x melanoma hybrids and is unrelated to the differentiated B-cell phenotype. Dominant expression of the Daudi ligand for human Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells in these hybrids may provide a basis for defining the stimulatory principle at the molecular level.
