The effect of HFDI (human fibroblast derived inhibitor) on cell growth inhibition and differentiation of J6-1 (leukemia cell line). Namalva (Burkitt's lymphoma cell line), and fresh leukemic bone marrow cell cultures was studied. HFDI was found to inhibit tumor and leukemic cell growth as assayed by 3H-TdR incorporation, cell degeneration and necrosis, and to induce differentiation. We demonstrated that the characteristics of PHA-inhibited lymphocyte transformation were, in fact, identical to those of HFDI-inhibited degeneration and necrosis and HFDI-induced differentiation. It seems that necrosis was related to target cell sensitivity to HFDI.
