A series of human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines, BALM-19, -20, -21, -22, -23 (BALM 19-23) and BALM-26 were established from a patient with B-cell characteristics of ALL L2 type. All cell lines were derived from bone marrow specimens, BALM 19-23 from a sample taken at diagnosisand BALM-26 from one at relapse. Like the original leukemia cells, the established lines present various B-cell characteristics, being positive for cell surface immunoglobulin (Ig) chains but also for nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase; hence the cell lines should be assigned to B-cell category B-IV. As a unique feature, the cell lines expressed the CD33 myeloid antigen in addition to the common B-cell markers. Heterogeneous antigen expression among the different cell lines was found regarding CD35, CD39, CD45RA, CD78 and CD95. The malignant nature of the cell lines was documented by negativity for the Epstein-Barr virus and by the occurrence of clonal non-random structural chromosome abnormalities. The patient's serum showed hypercalcemia, prompting further investigation of the established cell lines which expressed parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP) mRNA as examined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The established B-cell ALL sister cell lines, BALM 19-23 and BALM-26, could provide useful material for clarifying the pathogenesis of this type of B-cell malignancy. The scientific significance of this panel of cell lines lies in the availability of a series of clonally derived but phenotypically different sister cell lines established at different phases of the disease.
