While still a trainee in oncology, John Ziegler had the unexpected opportunity to direct a Burkitt's tumor research project in Africa. He was given a leading role in conducting early studies on the treatment of this tumor. Dr. Ziegler's youthful zeal, administrative talent, and scientific ingenuity enabled him, in a relatively short time, to carry out fundamental studies on treatment of Burkitt's tumor as well to establish an outstanding center for cancer research in tropical Africa. The lessons learned from these studies have become principles for treatment of many other human cancers.
