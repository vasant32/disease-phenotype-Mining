Using PCR with degenerate primers and screening of a human B-cell lymphoblast cDNA library, a full-length cDNA encoding a 375-amino-acid protein was isolated. It contains seven regions of hydrophobic amino acids probably representing membrane-spanning domains of a novel heptahelix receptor, tentatively named CMKRL2. It shows nearly 30% overall identity with the high-affinity IL8 receptor and similar degree of homology with other chemoattractant receptors, including the "fusin" coreceptors for HIV1. Measurements of various transduction pathways following application of a panel of chemokines to transfected cells failed to evoke any reproducible response. Although the natural ligand for CMKRL2 could, thus, not be identified, receptor expression in spleen and lymph nodes as well as in Burkitt's lymphoma (irrespective of EBV status) supports a functional role in activated B-cells. Receptor message was ubiquitously distributed in normal peripheral tissues and CNS, suggesting that CMKRL2 is expressed in widespread cell populations, such as macrophages and neuroglia.
