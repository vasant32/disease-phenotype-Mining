 OBJECTIVE: To identify the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) chromosomal integration sites in Raji cells. METHODS: EBV DNA was detected by Southern hybridization, and the viral chromosomal integration sites were identified using G banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS: BamHI-digested genomic DNA from Raji cells was hybridized with (32)P-labeled probe-1 (EBV genome 13,232 approximately 16,189) and Probe-2 (EBV genome 5 approximately 3,271), which generated 4 and 10, 23 kb positive bands respectively. The viral integration sites included 1p, 1q, 2q, 3p, 3q, 4 q, 5q, 6q, 7p, 7q, 9q,11p, 14 q, and 15q,and chromosomal bands 4 q, 2q, 1q and 7q were viral integration sites with high frequencies. Among the 33 signals counted, 7, 4, 4,and 4 signals were at the site 4 q, 2q, 1q, and 7q respectively, and 64% of the total signals were found in these 4 chromosomal bands. No viral integration occurred in chromosomes 16 approximately 22 or the sex chromosomes (X, Y). CONCLUSION: This study firstly identifies the EBV integration sites in Raji cells using G banding and FISH. There are some viral integration sites with high frequencies in Raji cells, and EBV integrates into Raji cell genomes non-randomly.
