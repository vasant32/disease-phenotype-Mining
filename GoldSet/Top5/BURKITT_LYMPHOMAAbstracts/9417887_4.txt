Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a key enzyme involved in polyamine production and is thought to regulate growth and apoptosis in multiple cell systems. A potential link between ODC and growth may involve the action of an oncogene c-myc which is thought to transcriptionally regulate ODC. We have examined the involvement of ODC in anti-IgM-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in Burkitt's lymphoma cells. Inhibitors of ODC such as difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) completely blocked ODC activity, resulting in growth inhibition but not apoptosis. Addition of putrescine, the product of ODC enzymatic action, to Ramos cells had only a minor effect on growth, did not cause apoptosis, did not augment or block anti-IgM-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis, but did reverse DFMO-mediated growth inhibition. Anti-IgM treatment of Ramos cells, which markedly decreased c-myc mRNA and protein, caused a paradoxical increase in ODC mRNA level as well as ODC enzymatic activity and increased cellular levels of putrescine. DFMO and putrescine did not alter c-myc mRNA levels directly, nor did they have any affects on anti-IgM-mediated down-regulation of c-myc mRNA. TNF-alpha, which inhibited anti-IgM-mediated apoptosis, did not inhibit either anti-IgM or DFMO-mediated inhibition of growth. These agents were without effect on ODC activity itself or on the anti-IgM-mediated increase in ODC activity. From these studies we conclude that ODC inhibition affects growth but is unrelated to the induction of apoptosis. Both anti-IgM-mediated inhibition of growth and induction of apoptosis are independent of ODC. Thus two distinct pathways for growth regulation are present: one in which ODC and polyamines are important and the other cell surface receptor-mediated (sIg) which is independent of ODC and polyamines.
