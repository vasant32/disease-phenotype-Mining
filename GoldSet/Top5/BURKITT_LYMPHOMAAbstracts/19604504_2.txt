The participation of Abl-Related Gene (ARG) is demonstrated in pathogenesis of different human malignancies. However there is no conclusive evidence on ARG expression level in mature B cell lymphomas. In this study we evaluated ARG protein expression in Follicular Lymphoma (FL), Burkitt's Lymphoma (BL) and Diffused Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) in comparison with non-neoplastic lymph nodes. Semi-quantitative fluorescent ImmunoHistoChemistry was applied on 14, 7 and 4 patients with DLBCL, FL and BL respectively, adding to 4 normal and 4 reactive lymph nodes. The mean ratio of ARG/GAPDH expression was significantly different (p<0.00) between lymphomas and control samples, with DLBCL having the highest ARG expression amongst all. Over expression of ARG was seen in FL and BL, with FL expressing statistically more ARG than BL. Moreover, the ARG/GAPDH expression ratio increased from DLBCL stage I towards stage VI, all showing significantly more ARG expression than FL and BL (in all cases p<0.00).
