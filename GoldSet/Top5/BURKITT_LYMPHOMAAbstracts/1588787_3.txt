Immunogenotypic changes in 32 patients with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), including three patients with t(4;11) and 13 with t(9;22), were determined using immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) chain gene probe and T-cell receptor beta, gamma and delta chain gene probes. Clonogenic assay was performed in 12 of the 32 patients. In this study, four patients had a germline configuration of the IgH chain gene, showing a dissociation between phenotypic and genotypic expression; three patients had Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) ALL. The immunogenotypic manifestation in Ph+ ALL does not depend on whether the leukemia cells had rearrangement within the major breakpoint cluster region (major-BCR) DNA sequence or the leukemia cells had myeloid-associated antigens. Colony assay using various recombinant cytokines demonstrated that the leukemia cells from four of 12 patients formed colonies in response to myelopoietic stimulants; three of the four patients were major-BCR-rearranged Ph+ ALL. Notably, cells from one patient with Ph+ ALL formed colonies on the addition of granulocytic colony-stimulating factor. This indicates not only the biological heterogeneity of ALL cells but also that some of the characteristics of the cells are related to specific chromosome changes.
