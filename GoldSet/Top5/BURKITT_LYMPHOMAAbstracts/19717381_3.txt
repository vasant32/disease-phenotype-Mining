Burkitt lymphoma is a highly curable disorder when treated with modern intensive chemotherapy regimens. The majority of adult patients with Burkitt lymphoma in the United States are over age 40 years. Older patients have historically been underrepresented in published clinical trials of modern intensive therapy, and the outcome of these patients has not been systematically reported. We therefore obtained and analyzed primary data from 14 Burkitt lymphoma treatment series and confirmed that older patients (age > 40 years) are underrepresented in the literature. Historically inferior outcomes of this age subgroup have improved substantially over time. We conclude that (1) modern intensive chemotherapy regimens should remain the standard of care for patients > age 40 with Burkitt lymphoma; (2) selected patients > age 40 now have highly favorable outcomes; and (3) future studies should include formal analysis of this subgroup of patients.
