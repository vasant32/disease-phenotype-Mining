A 2.0-kb thyroid peroxidase cDNA of human origin was used as probe for Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA from human somatic cells and human-rodent somatic cell hybrids. The results showed that the gene coding for human thyroid peroxidase is located on chromosome. 2. Further analysis of hybrids derived from Burkitt lymphoma cells carrying a (2;8)(p12;q24) translocation revealed that the gene maps to the region 2pter----p12.
