During latency, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) genome, as an episome, is attached to the nuclear matrix (NM) via the latent origin of replication ori P. Within this element, we have found that a region, 580 bp long, encompassing the replicator DS element, shows the strongest affinity for the NM. In addition, by cross-linking with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, we have identified two NM proteins with an apparent molecular weight of 85 and 60 kDa that, with high affinity and specificity, bind ori P. These proteins are not induced by EBV infection, but their interaction with ori P is lost upon induction of EBV lytic cycle. These data strongly suggest that the binding of ori P to specific components of the NM is required for EBV latent replication.
