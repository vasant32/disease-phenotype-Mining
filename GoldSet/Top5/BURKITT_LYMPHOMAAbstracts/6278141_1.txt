Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) receptor positive cells absorbed FITC-conjugated virions and were subsequently stained for DNA content with propidium iodide. These cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the relationship between cell cycle and EBV receptor (EBVR) expression on single cells. EBVR was present throughout the entire cell cycle. The level of expression, however, varied; increasing in G1 and G2/M while remaining approximately constant in S phase. Analysis of receptor density in terms of cell size demonstrated that smaller cells, in early G1, have a greater density of receptors per unit membrane than larger G2/M and S phase cells.
