To clarify the clinical and genetic features of Burkitt lymphoma with or without leukemic presentation, we have conducted clinical, cytogenetic, and genetic studies. Of 40 Japanese patients with Burkitt lymphoma examined by cytogenetic and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis or Southern blot analysis using MYC probes, 35 patients had t(8;14) translocations, and 5 had t(8;22). Breakpoints were located far upstream of MYC in 4 (12%) of 33 tumors with t(8;14), and Epstein-Barr virus infection was found in 3 (8%) of 40 tumors. These findings are similar to those reported for non-Japanese patients with the sporadic form of Burkitt lymphoma. Clinical and genetic characteristic were compared for 30 patients presenting with lymphoma and 10 presenting with leukemia. The overall survival was shorter in aggressively treated leukemia patients than in aggressively treated lymphoma patients (P = .003); however, the incidence rates of TP53 mutation, p16INK4a deletion, and p15INK4b deletion that were found in 6 (15%) of 40,3 (9%) of 35, and 2 (6%) of 35 tumors, respectively, were similar between the 2 subtypes. Thus, the present study has shown the different prognoses for the 2 subtypes of Burkitt lymphoma but has failed to clarify the genetic backgrounds that may explain the different outcomes.
