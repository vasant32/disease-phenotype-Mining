Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a rapidly dividing tumor that commonly presents itself in the jaw in its endemic form and the abdomen in the sporadic type. Central nervous system involvement at diagnosis is not uncommon, but there have been no previously published reports of BL involving the clivus. Increased tumor burden is associated with complications such as tumor lysis syndrome, and recognition of unusual presentations is important for timely management. We report 3 patients with BL involving the clivus at diagnosis.
