Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) carrying lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells were compared for their expression of class I antigens of the major histocompatibility complex. Five common BL lines, LCLs, pokeweed mitogen-stimulated blasts and resting B-cells from healthy donors, and eight pairs of BL cells and LCLs, each pair originating from one patient, were tested. Quantitative analysis was performed using a radioimmunoassay; qualitative aspects were studied by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In general, LCLs expressed significantly higher amounts of class I antigens than BL cells, the latter showing class I densities similar to or lower than peripheral resting B-cells. From analysis of the expression of class I-specific RNA, there is some evidence that class I antigen expression is regulated on the transcriptional level. In two BL cells studied, class I expression could be enhanced by gamma-interferon, whereas the corresponding LCLs seemed to be refractory to this treatment. One- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that in some BL lines, in addition to the generally lower class I expression, distinct class I specificities were down-regulated. None of these alterations in class I expression was EBV specific; however, they may well play a role in the recognition of BL cells and LCLs by cellular immune mechanisms. Thus, down-regulation of class I antigens may contribute to the resistance of BL cells to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, whereas their enhanced expression may improve the recognition of EBV-infected LCLs.
