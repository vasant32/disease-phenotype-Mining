 AIMS: The UbcH10 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme plays a key role in regulating mitosis completion. We have previously reported that UbcH10 overexpression is associated with aggressive thyroid, ovarian and breast carcinomas. The aim of this study was to investigate UbcH10 expression in human lymphomas. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cell lines and tissue samples of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were screened for UbcH10 expression at transcriptional and translational levels. UbcH10 expression was related to the grade of malignancy. In fact, it was low in indolent tumours and high in a variety of HL and NHL cell lines and in aggressive lymphomas. It was highest in Burkitt's lymphoma, as shown by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and by tissue microarray immunohistochemistry. Flow cytometry of cell lines confirmed that UbcH10 expression is cell-cycle dependent, steadily increasing in S phase, peaking in G(2)/M phase and dramatically decreasing in G(0)/G(1) phases. We also showed that UbcH10 plays a relevant role in lymphoid cell proliferation, since blocking of its synthesis by RNA interference inhibited cell growth. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results indicate that UbcH10 is a novel lymphoid proliferation marker encompassing the cell cycle window associated with exit from mitosis. Its overexpression in aggressive lymphomas suggests that UbcH10 could be a therapeutic target in this setting.
