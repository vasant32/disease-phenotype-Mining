 PURPOSE: To describe diplopia as the initial manifestation of the Burkitt lymphoma. DESIGN: Observational case report. METHODS: Retrospective chart review. RESULTS: A 53-year-old human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive man presented with a severe headache associated with binocular diplopia. Flow cytometric analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated a monoclonal B-lymphoid cell population consistent with the Burkitt lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmologists should be aware that diplopia may be the presenting manifestation of Burkitt lymphoma in an immunocompromised patient.
