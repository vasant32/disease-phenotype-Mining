The anti-cancer effects of bryostatin-1, a potent diacylglycerol analogue, have traditionally been attributed to its action on protein kinase C. However, we previously documented apoptosis in a B non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell line involving diacylglycerol analogue stimulation of Ras guanyl-releasing protein, a Ras activator, and Bim, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein. To further explore the role of Bim, we examined several Bim-deficient B non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells for their responses to pico, a synthetic bryostatin-1-like compound. The Bim(-) mantle cell lymphoma cell lines Jeko-1, Mino, Sp53, UPN1, and Z138 and the Bim(+) cell line Rec-1, as well as the Burkitt lymphoma cells lines BL2 (Bim(-)) and Daudi (Bim(+)), were examined for their response to pico using assays for proliferation and apoptosis as well as biochemical methods for Ras guanyl-releasing proteins and Bcl-2 family members. With the exception of UPN1, mantle cell lymphoma cell lines underwent pico-induced apoptosis, as did BL2. In some cases, hallmarks of apoptosis were substantially diminished in the presence of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors. Pico treatment generally led to increased expression of proapoptotic Bik, although the absolute levels of Bik varied considerably between cell lines. A pico-resistant variant of Z138 exhibited decreased Bik induction compared to parental Z138 cells. Pico also generally decreased expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL and Mcl1. Although, these changes in Bcl-2 family members seem unlikely to fully account for the differential behavior of the cell lines, our demonstration of a potent apoptotic process in most cell lines derived from mantle cell lymphoma encourages a re-examination of diacylglycerol analogues in the treatment of this subset of B non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases.
