 BACKGROUND: Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) that may be cured with intensive chemotherapy. The addition of the CD20-directed monoclonal antibody rituximab to CODOX-M/IVAC (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate, alternating with ifosfamide, etoposide, and cytarabine) has not been studied despite efficacy in other aggressive CD20-positive NHLs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty adult BL patients treated with or without rituximab were identified at our institutions. Response rate, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) are calculated. RESULTS: There were fewer relapses in rituximab-treated patients (3 of 40 versus 13 of 40, P = 0.01). There was a trend for improvement in outcome favoring rituximab-containing therapy, with 3-year PFS (74% versus 61%) and 3-year OS (77% versus 66%), although these did not reach statistical significance. Advanced age and central nervous system involvement were associated with poorer OS on multivariable Cox regression analysis, adjusting for treatment, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) involvement, and risk group. CONCLUSIONS: CODOX-M/IVAC, with or without rituximab, is a highly effective regimen for the treatment of adult BL. Rituximab decreased the recurrence rate and showed a trend in favor of improvement in PFS and OS. HIV-infected patients achieved outcomes comparable with those of their non-HIV-infected counterparts.
