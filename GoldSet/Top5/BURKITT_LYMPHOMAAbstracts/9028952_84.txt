The recent finding of somatically mutated mu heavy chain transcripts in human peripheral blood (PB) B lymphocytes suggests that T-dependent B-cell memory might not be restricted to class-switched cells. We provide here evidence that IgM-only PB B cells are likely to be the IgM-expressing counterpart of classical (IgM- IgD-) memory B cells in humans. As shown by molecular single cell analysis, most IgM-only cells carry mutated V region genes, like class-switched cells. Although both subsets represent populations of nonactivated, resting cells, they express higher levels of Ig mRNA than naive (IgM+ IgD+) B cells. IgM-only and class-switched cells are CD38- CD77-, and mostly CD23-, thus neither resembling germinal center nor naive B cells. Because many IgM-expressing B cells located in secondary lymphoid tissues resemble IgM-only PB B cells in terms of cell phenotype, we propose that the human lymphoid system contains a large compartment of IgM-expressing memory cells. Moreover, these cells seem to represent the nonmalignant counterparts of IgM-expressing tumor cells in sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma, MALT lymphoma, monocytoid B-cell lymphoma, and diffuse large-cell lymphoma that were found to harbor somatically mutated V genes.
