Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) plays a key role in the induction of somatic hypermutation and class switching at the immunoglobulin loci of B lymphocytes. AID overexpression can induce a mutator phenotype in lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell lines, suggesting that AID by itself is sufficient to trigger hypermutation and class switching. AID expression in vivo is considered to be restricted to germinal center B lymphocytes, yet AID expression is also seen in many B cell lymphomas, hinting at a potential role for the development of these malignancies. We used a GFP-based reversion assay to efficiently evaluate the activation of mutator phenotypes. As expected, AID overexpression in the human Burkitt lymphoma cell line BL70 caused hypermutation. Surprisingly, AID overexpression in the human pre-B cell line Nalm-6 failed to induce a detectable mutator phenotype, indicating that Nalm-6 cells are probably lacking an essential factor(s) to confer AID-induced mutagenesis. This finding supports the concept that AID overexpression by itself must not automatically lead to the onset of a mutator phenotype. In addition, treating Nalm-6 transfectants with thymidine, a potential mutagenic drug, caused profound mutation rates on the GFP transgene. Thus, the GFP-based mutation assay might prove a powerful tool to study protein- and chemical-induced mutator phenotypes in cell lines.
