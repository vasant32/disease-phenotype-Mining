Imaging findings of secondary hepatic lymphoma have been reported as variable, ranging from single or multiple small nodules to diffuse infiltrative tumor patterns. We hear present a rare case report concerning aggressive B cells, secondary Burkitt's lymphoma in non-AIDS demonstrating a surprising periportal lymphoma infiltration, without upper abdominal lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly on the sonography and CT scans. Clinically, the case was characterized by atypical and highly aggressive course, with the patient presenting an abruptly developed obstructive jaundice with rapidly deteriorating hepatic function that could be indicative of cholestatic hepatitis, which differs in its clinical manifestations from hepatic lymphoma without functional deterioration in respect of its non-tissue destructive growth pattern. We suggest that hepatic lymphoma can sometimes be consistent with periportal infiltrating homogeneous mass, with no lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly on the imaging examination, with a predictable aggressive clinical course of the disease and poor prognosis.
