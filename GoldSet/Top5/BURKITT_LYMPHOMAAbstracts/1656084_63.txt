The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BHRF1 open reading frame is abundantly expressed early in the lytic replication cycle. BHRF1 is also transiently expressed in some latently infected cell lines in the absence of expression of other lytic cycle proteins. BHRF1 shares distant, but significant, colinear primary amino acid sequence homology to Bc12, a cellular gene strongly implicated in the evolution of follicular lymphoma. The experiments reported here used a molecular genetic approach to examine the role of BHRF1 in EBV infection. Isogenic EBV recombinants having either wild-type BHRF1 or a null mutation due to a translational stop signal in place of the 24th BHRF1 codon were used to infect primary B lymphocytes. The BHRF1 mutant recombinants did not differ from the wild type in their ability to infect and transform the growth of primary B lymphocytes, to replicate in the resultant lymphoblastoid cell lines, or to initiate a second round of primary cell transformation. Deletion of the entire BHRF1 open reading frame did not destroy the ability of the mutant virus to maintain cell growth transformation. The significance of these findings with regard to the role of BHRF1 in EBV infection is discussed.
