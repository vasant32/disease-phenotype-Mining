Activity of 8 glycosidases (6 acid lysosomal and 2 neutral cytosolic enzymes) was estimated in lymphoid cells of 28 patients with different forms of lymphoproliferative disorders: B- and T-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), Sezary syndrome, hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and B- and T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Activity of these glycosidases was also studied in mononuclear cells and granulocytes of healthy volunteers and in immature myeloid cells of 16 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In lymphoid cells of all the patients studied (except of ALL) the glycosidases activity was decreased as compared with that of normal mononuclear cells and immature myeloid cells. Activity of the majority enzymes studied was higher in T-lymphoid cells of patients with lymphoproliferative disorders as compared with B-cells. The highest glycosidases activity was found in ALL cells and the lowest--in CLL cells of the patients with B-lymphoid cells forms of the disease. Activities of N-acetyl-beta-D-hexosaminidase, alpha-D-mannosidase and beta-D-glucuronidase were distinctly dissimilar in cells of the patients with B-CLL, B-NHL and HCL. Estimation of these glycosidases activity in lymphoid cells may be of importance in differential diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders.
