Sera from a small sample of adult blood donors, healthy school children and patients with lymphoma, leukaemia, non-haematologic cancer, congenital and inflammatory disorders from Ibadan, Nigeria were screened for HTLV-I antibody by an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay and confirmed by investigational Western blot. Seventy-nine of 236 positively screened samples could not be tested for confirmation. Seropositive reactivity was observed in nine of 123 blood donors, and 3 of 46 healthy school children but banding patterns on Western blot were often sparse. Among non-Burkitt's non Hodgkin's lymphoma patients six of 30 were HTLV-I positive including four of four with clinical features of adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL). Other clinical conditions had a frequency of positivity indistinguishable from healthy donors. Western blot patterns ranged from strong with multiple bands, which were uncommon, to those with only p24 and p21 envelope positive which were frequent. Given the relative paucity of clinical ATL and the unusual Western blot patterns the true rate of HTLV-I infection may be lower than estimated. It is possible that a cross-reactive HTLV-I-like virus accounts for this pattern.
