 PURPOSE: Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma occurs frequently in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). We determined the association between the clinical and histologic features of HIV-related lymphoma. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 291 patients with noncerebral HIV-related lymphoma who had been treated in multicenter trials coordinated by the Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte between 1988 and 1997. This study was performed mainly before the availability of combination antiretroviral therapy. RESULTS: The main histologic subtypes were centroblastic lymphoma in 131 patients (45%), immunoblastic lymphoma in 39 patients (13%), and Burkitt's lymphoma (including the classical form and the variant with plasmacytic differentiation) in 115 patients (40%). Burkitt's lymphoma was the most aggressive form, whereas immunoblastic lymphoma occurred in severely immunodeficient patients. Two-year survival after enrollment was 15% in immunoblastic lymphoma, 32% in Burkitt's lymphoma, and 31% in centroblastic lymphoma (P = 0.006), but multivariate analysis did not confirm the independent prognostic value of histologic subtype. Instead, five independent pretreatment factors increased the risk of mortality: age 40 years or older [relative risk (RR) = 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1 to 2.1; P = 0.005], elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level (RR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.1; P = 0.02), having a diagnosis of AIDS before lymphoma (RR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.6; P = 0.006), CD4(+) cell count less than 100 x 10(6)/L (RR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.6; P = 0.0004), and impaired performance status (RR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7 to 3.4; P <0.0001). CONCLUSION: Several pretreatment characteristics of HIV-related lymphoma were linked to the histologic form, but HIV disease parameters other than those of lymphoma were the main determinants of outcome, so the histologic features of the lymphoma were not associated with prognosis.
