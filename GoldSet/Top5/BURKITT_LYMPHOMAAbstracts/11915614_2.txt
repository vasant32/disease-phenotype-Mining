OBJECTIVES: Burkitt's lymphoma is one of the possible cause of spinal cord compression. We defined the surgical approach in this rare localization of Burkitt's lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report 7 cases of spinal cord compression secondary to Burkitt's lymphoma treated at the Yopougon University Hospital from October 1990 to October 1994. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 15.4 years, range 8 to 28 years. Five of the 7 patients were children. Surgery was both a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency in this rare but serious localization of Burkitt's disease, which remains highly chemosensitive. CONCLUSION: Surgical management is warranted if Burkitt's lymphoma is revealed by spinal cord compression or if there is a primary spinal epidural localization.
