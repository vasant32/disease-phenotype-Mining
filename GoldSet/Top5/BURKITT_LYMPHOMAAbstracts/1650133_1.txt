A new Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA)-positive B-cell line, designated BALL-2, was spontaneously established from the peripheral blood of a 14-year-old boy with an EBNA-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), L2 in the French-American-British classification. The BALL-2 cell line grew in suspension with or without forming clumps of cells. The cultured cells exhibited lymphoid morphology with indented or lobulated nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and relatively abundant cytoplasm. Immunologic and cytogenetic studies showed that the BALL-2 cell line expressed the B-cell phenotype, CpIg+, SmIg+, CD19+, CD20+, CD38-, Ia+, and had chromosome translocation, t(8;14) (q24;q32). The same phenotypic and chromosome markers were present in original leukemia cells. These results indicated that the cell line was derived from the patient's leukemia cells. Unexpectedly, however, BALL-2 cells were positive for EBNA and EB virus DNA. Gene analysis of the BALL-2 cell line showed biallelic rearrangements in the JH locus. One of the JH rearrangement comigrated with a rearranged c-myc gene, indicating the translocation had occurred between JH and c-myc loci. The t(8;14) abnormality is a known chromosome marker of Burkitt lymphoma and L3 type ALL. Our studies revealed that this translocation and myc gene rearrangement can also be found in L2 type B-ALL.
