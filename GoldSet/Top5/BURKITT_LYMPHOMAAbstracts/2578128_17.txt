Radioiodinated recombinant human beta-interferon (rHuIFN beta Ser), with almost full (greater than 90%) biological activity, was used to study the binding of human beta-interferon to Daudi cells. Specific binding was not observed with less biologically active (less than or equal to 10%) radioiodinated interferon. The bound radioiodinated interferon was shown to compete with human beta-interferon (HuIFN beta), rHuIFN beta Ser, human alpha-interferon (HuIFN alpha) and with human gamma-interferon (HuIFN gamma). Scatchard plot analyses suggest the presence of about 10,000 binding sites for HuIFN beta/Daudi cell. About 6,600 of these sites can be blocked by HuIFN alpha and 3,700 sites can be blocked by HuIFN gamma. The apparent Kd for HuIFN beta is 2.7 nM. The apparent Kd values for HuIFN alpha and HuIFN gamma are 3.7 and 1.1 nM, respectively. It was possible to demonstrate the cross-linking of HuIFN beta to two macromolecular components of Mr = 128,000 and 103,000. We propose the existence of at least two binding sites for HuIFN beta in Daudi cells, one site recognizing both HuIFN beta and HuIFN gamma, the other site recognizing both HuIFN beta and HuIFN alpha. Each site is capable of recognizing only HuIFN gamma or HuIFN alpha.
