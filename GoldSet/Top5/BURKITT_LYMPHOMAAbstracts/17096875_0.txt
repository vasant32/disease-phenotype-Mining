To evaluate the significance of FCM in minimal residual disease (MRD) detection, the immunophenotyping and leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIP) of leukemia cells from 273 adult and 142 childhood patients with B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) were detected by four to six antibody combinations of 4-color CD45/SSC gating multiparametric flow cytometry (FCM). The results showed that the B-ALL patients could be classified into 4 subtypes based on different expression CD34 and CD10: subtype I (CD34(+)/CD10(-)), subtype II (CD34(+)/CD10(+)), subtype III (CD34(-)/CD10(+)), subtype IV (CD34(-)/CD10(-)). The LAIP was observed in 100% and 92% patients of subtype I and subtype II, respectively, whereas only 79.2% in subtype III. The incidence of LAIP in total B-ALL cases was 90% by using the antibodies detected in this investigation. There was no significantce different for incidence of LAIP between adult and pediatric patients. LAIP was observed in 77.6% of patients by labeling only CD34/CD10/CD19/CD45 4-color antibody combination. It is concluded that in 90% of childhood and adult B-ALL patients LAIP can be found, which suits MRD detection by multiparameter flow cytometry.
