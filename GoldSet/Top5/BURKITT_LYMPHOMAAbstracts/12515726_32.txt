Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the treatment of choice for clinical depression and a range of anxiety-related disorders. They are well tolerated over extended periods with more than 50 million people worldwide benefiting from their use. Here we show that 3 structurally distinct SSRIs--fluoxetine, paroxetine, and citalopram--act directly on Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells to trigger rapid and extensive programmed cell death. SSRIs unexpectedly stimulated calcium flux, tyrosine phosphorylation, and down-regulation of the c-myc and nm23 genes in Burkitt lymphoma cells remaining faithful to the biopsy phenotype. Resultant SSRI-induced apoptosis was preceded by caspase activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) cleavage, DNA fragmentation, a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and the externalization of phosphatidylserine, and reversed by the overexpression of bcl-2. Normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tonsil B cells, whether resting or stimulated into cycle, were largely resistant to SSRI-induced death as were 5 non-BL lymphoid cell lines tested. We discuss these findings within the context of whether the SSRI class of antidepressants could find future application as potential therapeutics for the highly aggressive and-because of its association with AIDS-increasingly more common Burkitt lymphoma.
