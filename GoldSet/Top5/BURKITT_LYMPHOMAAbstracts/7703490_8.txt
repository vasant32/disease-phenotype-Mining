Recently G alpha 16, a new guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding protein alpha subunit has been described to be specifically expressed in human hematopoietic cells. Expression of G alpha 16 was observed in human cell lines of myelomonocytic and T-lymphocytic origin, but not in human B-cell lines Raji and IM9. We studied the expression of G alpha 16 in human B cells corresponding to different stages of B-cell differentiation by means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. The human Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines Raji, Ramos, BJAB, the lymphoblastoid cell line SKW6.4, and the plasmocytoma cell line U266 were devoid of G alpha 16. In contrast, G alpha 16 was detected in the human progenitor B cell lines Reh and Nalm-6. Using the mu+, k- cell line BLIN-1 (pre-B cell phenotype) and its derived subclone 1E8 (surface mu+, k+; B-cell phenotype) G alpha 16 expression was found to disappear on transition from pre-B to B-cell differentiation stage. The analysis of a broad panel of human neoplastic B lymphocytes ranging from progenitor B-acute lymphatic leukemia (pre-pre-B-ALL), common acute leukemias (cALL), pre-B-ALL, mature B-ALL to low grade B-cell lymphoma (chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell type, leukemic centrocytic non-Hodgkins lymphoma [NHL], hairy cell leukemia) showed that G alpha 16 expression is limited to progenitor and pre-B-ALL cells. Therefore, we conclude that within B-cell differentiation, G alpha 16 is expressed solely during early B cell ontogeny and downregulated during differentiation. Thus, G alpha 16 might be an important regulator involved in signaling processes in progenitor B cells.
