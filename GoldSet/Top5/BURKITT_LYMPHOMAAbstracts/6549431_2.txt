One third of all extranodal sites of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are localized to the digestive tract. Forty-six cases with digestive tract localization were studied, of which 15 were localized forms. Histologically, 70 p. cent were diffuse lymphomas with poor prognosis. The present survival rate for localized forms following chemotherapy is 77 p. cent, which plateaux at two years, as compared to 34 p. cent for disseminated forms. Treatment of digestive tract localizations should be similar to that of nodal forms with the same histology. With the development of intensive chemotherapeutic regimens over the last few years, the cure rate is hoped to attain 65 p. cent in disseminated forms, and 87 p. cent in localized forms.
