An uncommon primary site for an American Burkitt's lymphoma in the nasopharyngeal region was demonstrated by radiogallium imaging in a 14-year-old white boy. Fifth cranial nerve involvement and cerebrospinal fluid cytology for Burkitt's responded initially to four drug chemotherapy with objective reduction in the tumor radiogallium uptake. Clinical relapse and recurrence of the tumor radiogallium uptake in less than three weeks following the completion of therapy was observed. Local irradiation and chemotherapy successfully reduced the symptoms and eliminated the radiogallium tumor uptake. Radiogallium imaging is advocated as a principal method for staging and monitoring the course of Burkitt's lymphoma.
