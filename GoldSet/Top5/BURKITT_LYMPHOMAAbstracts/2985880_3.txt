Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can induce a broad spectrum of hematological diseases, especially in immune deficient patients. We assayed for receptor for EBV (EBVR) using fluoresceinated viral particles on 44 human hematopoietic cell lines derived from patients with T, B, and non-T, non-B acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), non-lymphoid leukemia, Burkitt lymphoma, myeloma and several unique lines we and others have recently developed. All 31 EBV nuclear-associated antigen (EBNA) negative cell lines were of neoplastic origin. Seven of 13 EBNA-positive cell lines were of normal cell origin. Four of 25 non-B (surface immunoglobulin negative) EBNA-negative neoplastic cell lines were EBVR-positive. Three of six EBNA-negative B-cell (surface immunoglobulin positive) lines were EBVR-positive. Nine of 13 EBNA-positive Burkitt and non-Burkitt cell lines strongly expressed EBVR. Four EBNA-positive Burkitt lymphoma cell lines exhibited EBVR only to a limited degree. Studies of the cell lines for EBVR, complement receptors (CR) and surface immunoglobulin (SIg) revealed that presence of SIg does not obligate the presence of EBVR. Functional EBVR accompanied SIg among EBNA-negative cell lines. SIg-negative cell lines can possess EBVR. Fourteen of 16 EBVR-positive lines were also positive for CR. The EBVR assay is a useful tool for assessing the potential role of EBV in the induction of hematopoietic disorders.
