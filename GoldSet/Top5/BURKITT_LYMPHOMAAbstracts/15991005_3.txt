To analyze the clinicopathologic characteristics of childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), EBER in situ hybridization was performed in 80 cases of NHLs. EBER-positive lymphomas account for 25% (20/80) and include NK/T-cell lymphoma (6/6), aggressive NK-cell leukemia (1/1), peripheral T cell lymphoma (5/11), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (5/14), hydroa-like T-cell lymphoma (1/1), marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (1/2), and post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (1/1). Other types including 19 cases of Burkitt's lymphoma were negative. For 9 EBER-positive cases, immunohistochemical staining for LMP-1, and EBNA-2 was performed to determine the EBV latency pattern. Two of nine EBER-positive cases expressed both LMP-1 and EBNA-2. Clinically, patients with EBV-positive B-cell lymphomas were cured with chemotherapy, whereas EBV-associated NK- and T cell lymphomas pursued fatal clinical course. In conclusion, EBVs infected in childhood NHLs are frequently associated not only with NK- and T- cell lymphomas but also large B-cell lymphomas.
