Sixty-three cases of jaw tumours in Nigerian Igbos are reviewed. Burkitt's tumour, fibro-osseous lesions, ameloblastoma and carcinoma were seen in progressively older patients. The Igbos, like fellow Nigerians, suffer from ameloblastoma at relatively earlier ages than other Africans. Although the Igbos are as prone to keloid formation as other Negro peoples, it is noteworthy that this fibrous tendency was not evident in their jaw tumours. None of the tumours exhibited melanin pigment. The incidence of Burkitt's tumour appears to be lower in the easterly Igbos than in the ethnic groups living in the westerly part of Nigeria.
