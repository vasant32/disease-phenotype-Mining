A 22-year-old white native Californian acquired multiple cranial nerve palsies. He was found to have a Burkitt's-type lymphoma involving the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, with orbital invasion. Bone marrow involvement developed. Despite aggressive therapy, he died 18 weeks after the onset of his illness. Poor prognostic indicators included CNS symptoms at the time of initial onset, bone marrow involvement, and postadolescent occurrence. The absence of viable tumor at autopsy indicates sensitivity of Burkitt's lymphoma cells to combination chemotherapy and irradiation treatment.
