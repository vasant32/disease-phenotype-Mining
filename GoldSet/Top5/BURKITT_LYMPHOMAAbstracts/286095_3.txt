The chromosomes of an Epstein-Barr virus-negative European Burkitt's lymphoma cell line were studied. All the cells carried the t(8;14) translocation. One clone had 51 chromosomes and was (+1,+7,+16,+15,+21), whereas another clone also had 51 chromosomes but was (+1q+,+7,+16,+15,+21). A third clone had 46 chromosomes (4q+/-).
