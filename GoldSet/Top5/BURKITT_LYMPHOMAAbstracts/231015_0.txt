Serial samples of sera from patients with African Burkitt's lymphoma were tested for antibody against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific membrane antigen (MA) by the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay (ADCC). Titers of patients in the long-term survivor group were generally higher than those found in the sera of patients in the short-term survivor group. Although ADCC titers to EBV-MA were not useful in predicting which patients would relapse there was a definite relationship between ADCC titer and prognosis. The individual differences in ADCC titers in patients in remission may explain the variability of responses that have been reported in studies on serotherapy with remission plasma.
