The report concerns the results of autoradiographic studies of cerebrospinal fluid cells. We investigated pleocytosis in cases of inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, hemorrhage in the cerebrospinal fluid space, brain tumor and hemoblastosis, as well as in cases of undefined neurologic disease. Cerebrospinal fluid was incubated with tritiated thymidine. The results show that tumor cells have the highest labeling index and monocytes the lowest. Cells from primary brain tumors incorporate tritiated thymidine more rarely and less intensely than cells from cerebral metastases. Lymphocytes from inflammatory disease in infants may demonstrate a high labeling index.
