The case describes a seven year-old Danish boy who was referred with a short history of nasal obstruction and enlargement of the lymph nodes on the left side of the neck. The ENT examination demonstrated a large parapharyngeal tumour, which was shown by CT-scanning to extend from the level of the zygomatic arch to the superior thoracic aperture. The histological diagnosis was a Burkitt's lymphoma.
