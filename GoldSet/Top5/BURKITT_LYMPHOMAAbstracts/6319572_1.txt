The selective and potent anti-herpesvirus drug, (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVdU), has been examined for its inhibitory effects on several parameters of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in the lymphoblastoid cell lines Raji, P3HR-1, B-95-8 and P3 hybrid cells (a human embryo oropharyngeal cell line fused with a nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line). At a dosage of 0.03 to 0.1 mM, BVdU caused a marked inhibition of (i) spontaneous viral capsid antigen (VCA) expression in B-95-8 and P3 hybrid cells, (ii) VCA expression and DNA synthesis in B-95-8 cells induced with croton oil and n-butyrate, (iii) early antigen (EA) expression and DNA synthesis in Raji cells superinfected with EBV, and (iv) VCA expression and DNA synthesis in B-95-8 cells superinfected with EBV. In its inhibitory effects on these various parameters of EBV infection, BVdU appears to be comparable to acyclovir [9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine], another selective anti-herpesvirus drug which has been previously recognized as an effective inhibitor of EBV replication.
