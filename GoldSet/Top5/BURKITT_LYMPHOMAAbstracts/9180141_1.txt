The human herpes virus Epstein-Barr (EBV) is clearly associated with African Burkitt's lymphoma and the undifferentiated form of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). EBV has been implicated in other types of lymphoma, as well as in some human breast cancers. However, its route of entry into epithelial cells is incompletely understood. We report here evidence that there is no gene alteration in the SCR 1 and 2 exons of EBVR/CR2 in human embryonic nasopharyngeal epithelial (HENE) cells and NPC cells and that SCR 1 and 2 mRNA could be detected in HENE cells, different differentiated NPC cell lines and well-differentiated NPC biopsies. None of 15 cases of poorly differentiated NPC cryosections has SCR 1 and 2 mRNA. We also provide evidence that transformation of HENE cells results from exposure to infectious EBV and that transformation is dependent on the presence of phorbol ester. These data suggest that expression of SCR 1 and 2 of EBVR/CR2 may be associated with replication of EBV and support the notion of direct infection and transformation of human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells destined to evolve into the carcinoma by EBV through EBVR/CR2.
