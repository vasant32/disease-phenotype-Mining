We have performed immunophenotyping studies on 186 untreated cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in an Egyptian population, using panels of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and an avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase detection system. Sixty-two of these cases were tested with a panel of mAb directed against the T-cell markers CD2, CD4, CD8, B-cell markers CD20, kappa and lambda, the common ALL antigen (common ALLa) and class II HLA antigens. The remaining 124 cases were also tested with additional markers of T- and B-cell precursors, namely CD7 and CD19. The common leukocyte antigen, T200, was used to exclude nonhemopoietic neoplasms. Cases that remained unclassifiable were further tested with a wider panel of T-cell markers, including CD1, CD2, CD3 and CD5. In some cases multiple mAb directed against the same antigens were used. The relative frequencies of common ALL and B ALL were calculated from the total number of cases and were found to be 39.2% and 3.2%, respectively. The proportions of T-cell and null leukemias were calculated from the better characterized subgroup of 124 cases, and were found to be 50% and 4.8%, respectively. In our series, the age distribution of common ALL revealed a peak at 2-5 yr, but this was partially obscured in the entire series by the high proportion of T-cell cases, which had an age peak between 4 and 12 yr of age. Our results demonstrate marked differences in the phenotypic pattern of ALL in Egypt compared to Western Countries, the predominant finding being a relative excess of T-cell ALL and a paucity of common ALL cases. At present it is not clear whether this results from an increased incidence of T-cell ALL or a decreased incidence of common ALL.
