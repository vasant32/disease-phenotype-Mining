The effect of rIL-4 on the expression of low affinity receptor for the Fc part of IgE (Fc epsilon R2/CD23) and class II MHC antigens on Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines was investigated. Some of the BL lines contained low percentages of CD23 and HLA-DQ-positive cells, but virtually all cells expressed HLA-DR. IL-4 induced CD23 and class II MHC Ag expression on 7 of 9 BL. Optimal CD23 and class II MHC expression was observed after 48-72 h of incubation. Induction of CD23 and class II MHC Ag in the BL cell line BL2 by IL-4 was confirmed at the specific mRNA level. Significant activation of HLA-DQ mRNA was obtained after 6 h of incubation with IL-4 and gradually increased during prolonged incubation. Maximal induction of mRNA transcription occurred after 48 to 72 h. Optimal induction of HLA-DR and CD23 transcription in BL2 was also observed after 48 to 72 h. The induction of CD23 and class II MHC Ag seems to be specific for IL-4, because rIL-1, rIL-2, rIFN-gamma, recombinant granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, and a commercial source of low m.w. B cell growth factor were ineffective. In addition, the expression of class I MHC Ag, the transferrin receptor, CD38, CD25, CD10, CD20, and CD21 were not affected by IL-4. Interestingly, IFN-gamma and PGE2 suppressed the IL-4-induced membrane expression of CD23 and class II MHC Ag in a dose-dependent way. IFN-gamma also blocked IL-4-induced CD23 mRNA transcription in BL2 completely, whereas PGE2 (10(-7) M) was partially inhibitory. The induction of CD23 and class II MHC Ag by IL-4 required intact protein synthesis as shown by its inhibition by cycloheximide. These results indicate that the induction of CD23 and class II MHC Ag by IL-4 is regulated in a coordinated way.
