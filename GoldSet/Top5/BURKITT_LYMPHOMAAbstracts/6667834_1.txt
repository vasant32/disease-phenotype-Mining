A novel cultured cell line, P32/Ishida, was established from a Japanese 8-year-old boy with abdominal Burkitt's lymphoma. The P32/Ishida cells were proved to have immature B-cell phenotypes on the basis of immunological surface marker analysis: surface immunoglobulins (gamma, mu, kappa), Ia-like antigen, B1 antigen, and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen were positive. A small amount of IgM, but no IgG, could be detected in both cell extract and culture supernate of P32/Ishida cells. Cytogenetic studies revealed that the P32/Ishida cells consisted of cells having three derivative karyotypes characterized by common marker chromosomes, dup(1), and 14q + due to a new variant chromosomal translocation (2;14), which has not been identified in usual Burkitt's cell lines. Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity were confirmed to be negative.
