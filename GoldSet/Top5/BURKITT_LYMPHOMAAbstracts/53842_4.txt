Type-C RNA tumor virus particles were released from three different human lymphoblastoid cell lines after incubation in arginine-deficient medium. The released virus-like particles were characterized by (a) their ability to band in sucrose gradients at a density of 1.16-1.18 g/ml; (b) the presence of an RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity resembling that of the oncornaviruses; and (c) isolation of cores that band at a density of 1.26-1.27 g/ml in sucrose gradients. Examination of the arginine-deprived human lymphoblastoid cell line strain P3HR-1 by electron microscopy revealed the presence of C-type particles in the intracellular spaces.
