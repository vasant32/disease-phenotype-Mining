A case of Burkitt's type ALL with numb chin syndrome as the initial manifestation is described. A 57-year-old Japanese male was admitted to our hospital in November 14, 1989 because of paresthesia at the chin and lower lip with diplopia and ptosis. Neurological examination revealed oculomotor paralysis of the right side and hypesthesia on the chin, lower lip and buccal mucous membrane. Laboratory findings showed increased leukocyte count. Bone marrow aspirate revealed hypercellular marrow with 92.3% leukemic cells which had vacuoles in the cytoplasm and surface marker of IgM, kappa type. The abnormalities of karyotype included t(8;14). He was treated with chemotherapy and radiation. His conditions were temporarily improved, but relapsed later and died in March 6, 1990. Leukemic infiltrations to the trigeminal nerve were found in autopsy. The relationship between lymphoid malignancies and numb chin syndrome was discussed.
