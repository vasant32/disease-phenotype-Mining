Ninety-six untreated patients with malignant lymphoma (ML), 81 Hodgkin's disease, and 15 Burkitt's lymphoma were studied for zinc (Zn) status, and 21 patients also had selenium (Se) status analysis. Plasma and hair Zn and Se levels were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Chronic Zn and Se deficiencies (low plasma and low hair Zn and Se levels together) were found to be associated with ML in Turkish children. This was most likely due to the poor "nutritional environment" of the patients because majority of the ML patients were from families of low socioeconomic status. Supplementation of pediatric ML patients with Zn and Se, in addition to standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimen, is recommended.
