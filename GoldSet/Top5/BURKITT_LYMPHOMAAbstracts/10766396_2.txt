In the present study, mutations or protein expression of p53, bcl-2 and bax are reported in 13 non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphomas of the head and neck. Nine of 13 cases (69.2%) expressed p53 protein and 7 (53.8%) showed gene mutations. On comparing the results of immunostaining and SSCP analysis, there were two cases showing discrepancies between the p53 protein expression and gene mutations. Bcl-2 protein expression was observed in only two cases of follicular lymphoma. On the other hand, bax protein was detected in all 13 cases. One case with mutated bax gene showed a lower expression with a reduced frequency of bax-positive cells than the other 12. These results suggest that inactivation of p53 may be closely related to development and/or progression of these NHLs, and that bcl-2 and bax protein may not have a role.
