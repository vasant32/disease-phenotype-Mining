A 35-year old woman developed Burkitt's lymphoma and was treated with rituximab and CHOP therapy early during pregnancy. Monitoring of rituximab concentrations and B-cell counts in the child revealed a transient complete B-cell depletion associated with high rituximab cord blood concentrations. B-cell recovery was fast, showing a regular immunophenotype without loss of CD20 antigen, no functional deficits and adequate vaccination IgG titers.
