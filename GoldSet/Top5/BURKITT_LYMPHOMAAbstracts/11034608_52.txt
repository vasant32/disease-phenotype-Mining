Chromosomal translocations juxtaposing the MYC protooncogene with regulatory sequences of immunoglobulin (Ig) H chain or kappa (Ig kappa) or lambda (Ig lambda) L chain genes and effecting deregulated expression of MYC are the hallmarks of human Burkitt lymphoma (BL). Here we report that lymphomas with striking similarities to BL develop in mice bearing a mutated human MYC gene controlled by a reconstructed Ig lambda locus encompassing all the elements required for establishment of locus control in vitro. Diffusely infiltrating lymphomas with a typical starry sky appearance occurred in multiple founders and an established line, indicating independence from positional effects. Monoclonal IgM(+)CD5(-)CD23(-) tumors developed from an initially polyclonal population of B cells. These results demonstrate that the phenotype of B lineage lymphomas induced by MYC dysregulation is highly dependent on cooperativity among the regulatory elements that govern expression of the protooncogene and provide a new system for studying the pathogenesis of BL.
