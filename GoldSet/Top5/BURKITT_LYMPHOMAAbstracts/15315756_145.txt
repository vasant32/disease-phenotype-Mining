Chromosome translocations between c-myc and immunoglobulin (Ig) are associated with Burkitt's lymphoma in humans and with pristane- and IL6-induced plasmacytomas in mice. These translocations frequently involve Ig switch regions, suggesting that they might be the result of aberrant Ig class switch recombination (CSR). However, a direct link between CSR and chromosome translocations has not been established. We have examined c-myc/IgH translocations in IL6 transgenic mice that are mutant for activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID), the enzyme that initiates CSR. Here we report that AID is essential for the c-myc/IgH chromosome translocations induced by IL6.
