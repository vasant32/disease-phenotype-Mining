The PI3K/AKT signaling is activated in various hematologic malignancies. We evaluated the effect of a novel, pan-AKT kinase inhibitor, GSK690693, on the proliferation of 112 cell lines representing different hematologic neoplasia. Fifty-five percent of all cell lines tested were sensitive to AKT inhibitor (EC(50)<1 microM), with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma showing 89%, 73%, and 67% sensitivity to GSK690693, respectively. The antiproliferative effect was selective for the malignant cells, as GSK690693 did not inhibit the proliferation of normal human CD4(+) peripheral T lymphocytes as well as mouse thymocytes. Phosphorylation of downstream substrates of AKT was reduced in both sensitive and insensitive cell lines on treatment with GSK690693, suggesting that the cause of resistance was not related to the lack of AKT kinase inhibition. Consistent with the role of AKT in cell survival, GSK690693 also induced apoptosis in sensitive ALL cell lines. Overall, our data provide direct evidence for the role of AKT signaling in various hematologic malignancies, especially ALL and some lymphomas.
