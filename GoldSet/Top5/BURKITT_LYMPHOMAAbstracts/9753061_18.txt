Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) genome has been found in several human lymphoid malignancies, but configuration of the HHV-6 genome has not been well delineated. We established the HHV-6-positive, Epstein-Barr virus-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Katata. In this study we investigated the status of the HHV-6 genome in Katata cells. Neither linear nor circular HHV-6 DNA was detected by Gardella gel analysis. The fluorescence in situ hybridization technique enabled us to directly visualize the integrated HHV-6 DNA at the single-cell level. Only one integrated site of viral DNA was detected in metaphase chromosomes and it was preferentially located at the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q13). Treatment of the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or with calcium ionophore A23187 led to induction of the HHV-6 immediate-early gene as well as the late gene. Sodium n-butyrate also gave rise to expression of the HHV-6 genes. The TPA inducibility was synergistically enhanced when combined with A23187 or n-butyrate. Our study provides, for the first time, an in vitro model system of latent HHV-6 infection whose genome is integrated into host DNA of lymphoma cells.
