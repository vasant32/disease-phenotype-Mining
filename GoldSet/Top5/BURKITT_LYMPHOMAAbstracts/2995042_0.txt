Two established cell lines of human B-cell lymphomas derived from Burkitt lymphomas and their Epstein-Barr virus-transformed counterparts were analyzed with respect to their ability to bind the beta-galactoside-specific lectin Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA). Native and sialidase- as well as sialidase-beta-galactosidase-treated cells were compared. The method for the quantitative determination of average numbers of binding sites and of apparent affinity constants was flow cytometry with fluorescence-labeled lectin. Although with native cells there was no significant deviation of the values for virus-transformed cells from those for the parent cells, some differences could be detected after glycosidase treatment. The general procedure of the combined application of specific glycosidases and the quantitation of sugar-specific lectin binding is recommended as a general strategy for the differentiation of cells with known or putative differences in biological functions.
