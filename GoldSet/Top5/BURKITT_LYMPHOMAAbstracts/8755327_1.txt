We present a case of Burkitt's lymphoma, American type, with massive abdominal involvement, in a 11 years old boy, who presented with mucous-cutaneous paleness, cephalalgia and melaena. The localization of the lesion in the gallbladder and the rectum is stressed as being exceptional. We emphasize the importance of a rapid diagnosis to start early chemotherapy because this lesion grows rapidly. In our case after eight days of chemotherapy treatment there was a 75% reduction of the tumor mass.
