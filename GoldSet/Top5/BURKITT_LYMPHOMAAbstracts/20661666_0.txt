Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by specific morphological and immunophenotypic features. The basic genetic feature of BL is the rearrangement of MYC gene, visible as t(8;14)(q24;q32) translocation or its variant. However, some lymphomas with characteristic BL morphology are nowadays diagnosed as B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable with features intermediate between DLBCL and BL (Inter-DLBCL/BL) for biological or clinical reasons. We present four lymphomas without the MYC rearrangement presented typical Burkitt morphology, FCM immunophenotype with some deviations when compared to a typical BL. The cases were finally diagnosed as Inter-DLBCL/BL. All of them presented a recurrent abnormality within the chromosome 11: dup(11)(q23q13). We suppose that the dup(11)(q23q13), in absence of the MYC gene rearrangement, is connected with borderline lymphomas with a morphology similar or identical to that of the Burkitt lymphoma. Identifying such an aberration may be helpful in the diagnostics of Inter-DLBCL/BL eventually forming a distinct subgroup of lymphomas.
