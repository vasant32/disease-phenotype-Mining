An immunotoxin was synthesized with pokeweed antiviral protein and an IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against human B and pre-B cells. The B43 murine monoclonal antibody does not react with normal human bone marrow precursor cells. The immunotoxin bound to all Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines that were tested but not to human peripheral blood T cells. The ability of antibody-toxin conjugate to inhibit human lymphoblast cell lines was checked in a clonogenic assay system. The immunotoxin in the presence of chloroquine elicited 5.8 logs of killing of Burkitt's lymphoma cells (B-ALL). The efficient inhibition of clonogenic growth of B-ALL cells was not affected by the presence of normal bone marrow cells. The immunotoxin was not very toxic to pluripotent stem cells; less than 50% of the stem cells were lost under conditions where 5.6 logs of clonogenic lymphoma cells were eliminated from a 100-fold excess of normal marrow cells. Further, when assayed by long-term human bone marrow cultures, immunotoxin treatment did not result in a significant loss of pluripotent precursor cells.
