In an attempt to detect and characterize congenital, neonatal and early childhood EBV infections, a prospective sero-epidemiological study was undertaken in 112 newborn infants and their mothers, 25 additional newborns undergoing exchange transfusion, 114 randomly selected hospitalized infants aged 0 to 3 years, and 109 siblings and parents of these infants. Leukocyte culture was attempted in all the newborns and in 25 pre- and post-transfusion.The findings of EBV seroconversion in six patients without clearly apparent illness, infectious mononucleosis in only one case with significant EBV antibody rise, seroreversion in three cases in early childhood, higher newborn than maternal EBV antibody titres in three cases and the establishment of two permanent lymphoblastoid cell lines from newborns following exchange transfusion raise the possibility of abortive primary EBV infection in early life. Congenital or neonatal infections following exchange transfusions, however, could not be substantiated with certainty since the EBV antibodies did not persist at follow-up except possibly in two cases. Parenteral transmission of the EB virus by exchange transfusion at birth is probably prevented by the presence of EBV antibodies in either donor or recipient.
