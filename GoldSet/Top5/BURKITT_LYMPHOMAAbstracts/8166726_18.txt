The state of phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (RB) protein is regulated by CDK2 and CDC2 kinases. In the studies presented here, we have investigated the effect of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) on cyclin-dependent kinases in Daudi cells which were synchronized at different points of the cell cycle progression. We observed that the IFN-alpha enhances the expression of underphosphorylated RB protein in Daudi cells released from the G1/S, and this was closely associated with the inhibition of CDK2 kinase and not CDC2 kinase activity. The observed IFN-alpha-sensitive CDK2 kinase activity was dependent on Cyclin E and cyclin D1 but not on cyclin A and was physically associated with transcriptional factors: RB and E2F. In addition, treatment of G1/S Daudi cells with IFN-alpha also inhibited the ability of CDK2 enzyme to phosphorylate the RB protein in vitro. These results suggest possible involvement of cell cycle kinases in IFN-alpha action.
