Transcription of the terminal protein (TP) gene of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in Burkitt's lymphoma cells, in EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cells converted with transformation-defective (P3HR1) and transformation-competent (B95-8, AG876) EBV strains, and in EBV-immortalized cell lines was studied. A TP1 cDNA probe spanning the boundary between exons 1 and 2 and discriminating between TP1 and TP2 transcripts was used for S1 analysis. TP RNA expression varied widely in Burkitt's lymphoma cells. TP-specific transcripts were not detectable or only hardly detectable in Burkitt's lymphoma cells with the group I phenotype (CD10+ CD77+ CD21- CD23- CD30- CDw70-) as well as in P3HR1 virus-converted Burkitt's lymphoma lines. TP expression was high in Burkitt's lymphoma lines with the group II and group III phenotypes (CD21+ CD23+ CD30+ CDw70+), in B95-8 and AG876 virus-converted lines, and in EBV-immortalized cells. Detection of TP1 RNA correlated with EBNA2 expression. TP1 transcription was shown to be dependent on EBNA2 expression by stable transfection of an EBNA2 expression vector into P3HR1 virus-converted BL41 cells. EBNA2 is activating the TP1 as well as the TP2 promoter, as shown by the analysis of TP promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs transiently transfected into EBNA2-positive and EBNA2-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cells.
