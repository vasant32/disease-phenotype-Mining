The records of 465 patients admitted, or having biopsy, for malignant disease in one hospital over the 14 year period 1954-67, have been reviewed. Relative frequencies for different sites have been calculated and details recorded. The records of patients from Ilesha township, with a known population, were used to calculate incidence figures for the commonest tumours. Comparisons have been made with figures published from other West African hospitals. Carcinoma of stomach was the commonest form of cancer. A plea is made for more such surveys in West African district hospitals.
