We studied two cases of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) recently seen at out institution for association with the Epstein-Barr (EB) virus. Biopsies from both patients fulfilled the established criteria for the diagnosis of BL. One case had clinical features resembling those of EB virus-associated BL, and showed a pattern of elevated titres of antibodies to EB viral antigens indicative of virus association. The second case had several clinical features resembling those of non-virus-associated BL, and did not show the diagnostic serologic pattern. This report documents for the first time the association of EB virus with BL in India, and indicates that the virus-associated and non-virus-associated forms of BL may coexist in this country.
