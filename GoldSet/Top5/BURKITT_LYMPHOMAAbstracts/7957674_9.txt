Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that exert an antiviral effect on target cells and possess immunomodulatory and antitumor properties. In this study we have investigated the effects of human recombinant IFN-gamma on human leukemic B cell lines at different stages of maturation. Our data show that in Burkitt's lymphoma RAMOS-1 B cells IFN-gamma induces a reduction of cell growth and a clonal selection via programmed cell death; in contrast, IFN-gamma treatment of KM-3 pre-B cells does not induce biochemical and morphological changes as shown by electron microscope analysis and DNA gel electrophoresis.
