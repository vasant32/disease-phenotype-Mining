The expression of phosphoinositidase C (PIC) at nuclear and cytoplasmic level has been revealed in control and interferon treated Burkitt lymphoma cells by means of western blotting and immunocytochemical analysis employing specific monoclonal antibodies against beta 1, gamma 1 and delta 1 isozymes. Results have indicated that PIC isoform beta 1, mainly detectable in the nucleus, undergoes transient modifications early after interferon treatment. PIC delta 1 has been found only at cytoplasmic level, apparently insensitive to interferon treatment, while PIC gamma 1 was scarcely or not detected either in the cytoplasmic or in the nuclear compartment. These results suggest that interferon may exert its antiproliferative effect activating at least two distinct pathways of signal transduction, at cytoplasmic and nuclear level, involving inositol lipid cycle mainly in the nucleus by modulation of PIC beta 1 expression.
