We present the case of an 18-year-old female with Burkitt lymphoma involving the intra-abdominal and inguinal lymph nodes. The tumor had invaded the left femoral and common iliac veins causing secondary thrombosis and vessel occlusion. Chemotherapy and anticoagulant treatment resulted in mild thrombocytopenia and a prolonged prothrombin time, respectively, which exacerbated postoperative bleeding following surgical removal of a deep inguinal necrosis. After 6 days, bleeding combined with epistaxis was considered to be life threatening and anticoagulant reversal with recombinant factor VIIa was successfully performed. The patient has since achieved complete remission and subsequent antithrombotic therapy has resolved the vascular occlusion.
