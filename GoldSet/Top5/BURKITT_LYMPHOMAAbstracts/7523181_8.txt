We recently showed that recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) maintained the viability of human neutrophils in incubation for up to 72 hours. However, it is not known whether rhG-CSF can enhance neutrophil survival in in vivo situations. To clarify this issue, we investigated neutrophil survival in vitro following in vivo injection of rhG-CSF. Neutrophils were obtained from 4 pediatric patients with malignancies and healthy adult volunteers before and after rhG-CSF administration. Neutrophils obtained before rhG-CSF treatment started to undergo apoptosis after 24 h of incubation. In contrast, the survival of neutrophils drawn after rhG-CSF administration increased by approximately 24 h. Concomitantly, the appearance of typical ladder-like DNA fragmentation was delayed. Such an increase in neutrophil survival was inhibited by co-incubation with either H 7 (10 mumol/l) or H 8 (20 mumol/l), which worked as protein kinase C inhibitors. Although our study did not measure neutrophil survival in vivo directly, it provides us with further evidence that rhG-CSF may function to prolong neutrophil life expectancy in vivo.
