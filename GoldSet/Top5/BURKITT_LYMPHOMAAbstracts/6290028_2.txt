Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated early (EA) and virus capsid antigens (VCA) were efficiently induced in the viral genome-carrying human lymphoblastoid cells, P3HR-1 and Raji, by the culture fluids of Propionibacterium acnes, P. avidum, P. lymphophilum and Arachnia propionica, the anaerobes which are commonly seen among the normal flora of man. The active principle for EBV-induction in the 2 cell lines was the propionic acid produced by the microbes and such activity was shown to correlate with the fatty acid content of the culture media.
