Supernatants obtained from the in vitro culture of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes induced prolonged lymphocyte survival in culture for more than 8 weeks in six cultures and permanent cell lines were established in four of these. The cells in the latter showed lymphoblastoid features similar to those seen in parallel cultures to which transforming Epstein-Barr (EB) virus instead of P. falciparum derived substances had been added. Cells from the same donors stimulated with other mitogens (pokeweed mitogen, Salmonella paratyphi culture supernatants) ceased to proliferate and died after 3-4 weeks. A 195 Kd polypeptide obtained from P. falciparum parasites also exhibited the potential to transform normal lymphocytes. Characterization of the cell lines indicated a B lymphocyte origin and the presence of EB virus in these lines suggests the possibility that P. falciparum products may activate latent EB virus genomes. These observations appear relevant to both the choice of P. falciparum derived antigens as vaccines, and to the interaction of EB virus and malaria in the aetiology of African Burkitt's lymphoma (BL).
