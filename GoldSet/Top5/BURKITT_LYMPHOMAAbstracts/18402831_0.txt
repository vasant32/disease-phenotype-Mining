We report herein a case of sporadic primary cardiac bi-atrial Burkitt lymphoma (BL) occurred in a 67-year-old white immunocompetent patient and presenting with signs and symptoms of severe bilateral atrioventricular inflow impairment. Extranodal BL involving the heart is rare and seldom recognized clinically. Delayed discovery contributes to significant mortality. In the case presented extended surgical excision and intensive combination chemotherapy regiments resulted in complete remission at 1 year.
