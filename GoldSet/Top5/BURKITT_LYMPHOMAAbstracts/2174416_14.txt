We assessed 33 lymphoid tissues from 15 patients, including 7 with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) and 8 patients with sporadic fatal infectious mononucleosis (IM), to determine whether the cellular infiltrate had the immunophenotype and expressed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded proteins characteristic of either EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) or EBV-carrying Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells. The results of these studies revealed that in 13 cases the proliferating B cells were polyclonal, LCL-like, and in 2 cases they were monoclonal, malignant lymphoma-like.
