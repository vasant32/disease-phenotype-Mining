A Burkitt lymphoma cell line infected in vitro with a transformation-defective mutant recombinant Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was used to attempt marker rescue of transformation competence by transfection with cloned wild-type DNA. EBV replication was induced in the transfected cells, and wild-type EBV DNA recombined via flanking homologous sequences adjacent to the deletion, resulting in a virus which transformed primary B lymphocytes in vitro. This strategy should be useful for molecular genetic analysis of the role of part or all of any gene in cell growth transformation.
