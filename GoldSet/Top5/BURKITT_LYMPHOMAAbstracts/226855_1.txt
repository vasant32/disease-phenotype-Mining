Sera collected from Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) patients before and after tumor manifestation were tested for antibodies to herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), measles virus (MV) and adenovirus type 5, using the immunofluorescent (IF) techniques in all instances except for MV where complement fixation (CF) was used. It was found that none of these viruses showed higher antibody levels in BL patients than in controls, either before or after the appearance of the tumor. The patients came from the West Nile District of Uganda.
