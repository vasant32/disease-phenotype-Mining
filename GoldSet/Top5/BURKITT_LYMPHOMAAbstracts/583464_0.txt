Plastic dishes were coated with an agarose layer. The layer was modified by covalently binding proteins to it, using the CNBr-method. Cells were seeded on the dishes and the number of attached cells was evaluated. The specificity of the attachment was demonstrated by showing that cells, carrying specific membrane-bound immunoglobulins, attached only to the corresponding anti-immunoglobulins. This indicated that the method could be used for cell sorting. The attachment of cells to proteins was influenced by the amount of bound protein, incubation time, temperature and the degree of trypsinization. Most attached cells were viable for several days and when dying they detached. Detailed morphological and cytochemical analyses of the dynamics of attachment and cytoplasmic spreading on the chemically well-defined surfaces were possible using the new method.
