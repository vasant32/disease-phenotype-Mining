The clinical features of 30 retrospectively diagnosed cases of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) at the American University Medical Center (AUMC) in Beirut differed from those of African Burkitt's in that the majority of the AUMC patients presented with abdominal disease, and from the American form, in that the AUMC patients were younger, with a median age similar to that of African BL patients.
