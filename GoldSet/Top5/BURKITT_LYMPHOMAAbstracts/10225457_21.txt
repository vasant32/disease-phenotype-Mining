Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protein expressed in EBV-transformed B lymphocytes and in approximately 50% of nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs). LMP1 signaling involves several cellular signaling intermediates, especially TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs). We have shown previously that LMP1 is highly concentrated in a cell fraction called glycosphingolipid-rich membrane complexes (GSL complexes). We report here that parallel accumulation of LMP1 and TRAF3, but not TRAF1 or TRADD, was observed in GSL complexes from lymphoblastoid and LMP1-positive NPC cells. In contrast, TRAF3 was not concentrated in GSL complexes from LMP1-negative cells. Binding of LMP1 and TRAF3 in GSL complexes was demonstrated in lymphoblastoid and NPC cells, by co-immunoprecipitation with both anti-LMP1 and anti-TRAF3 antibodies.
