In a retrospective study based on 107 B-CLL patients, the expression of the adhesion molecules CD44, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD18, CD25 and CD54 was analysed in bone marrow cryostat sections by immunohistochemistry. CD44 expression clearly identified two subgroups of B-CLL patients with different clinical course. In particular, CD44-positive patients presented with advanced disease, more often displayed a diffuse pattern of bone marrow infiltration, and had a worse prognosis. 33/61 patients positive for CD44 died within the observation period compared to 7/46 patients negative for CD44 (P = 0.0012). Multivariate analysis emphasized the independent prognostic value of CD44 expression for overall survival (P = 0.022). In contrast, patients positive for CD11c showed a longer survival, with 9/40 patients dying within the observation period compared to 31/67 negative for CD11c (P = 0.0013). Patients lacking CD11c were in advanced Rai and Binet stage. Multivariate analysis confirmed CD11c as a relevant independent prognostic marker (P = 0.033). Moreover, CD11c was able to separate patients with significantly different prognosis in the subgroup of CD44-positive cases. 4/18 patients positive for CD44 and CD11c died before median survival time was reached. Patients positive for CD44 but negative for CD11c had an adverse prognosis: 29/43 patients died, median survival time was 33.4 months. Our results indicate that CD44 positivity and CD11c negativity are associated with more advanced disease and worse prognosis in B-CLL and suggest CD44-positive/CD11c-negative cases represent a more aggressive form of the disease.
