We report here on the preliminary treatment findings of a CCLSG NHL 960 study that was initiated in March 1996. In this study, 37 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were assigned to 4 different treatment groups according to disease stage and histology: (1) localized disease; (2) advanced disease, lymphoblastic type; (3) advanced disease, large cell type; and (4) advanced disease, Burkitt type. The first three groups received the modified protocols of the NHL 890 study. Groups 1 and 3 received COPADM induction therapy (CPM, VCR, PRD, ADR, and MTX). After achieving remission, Group 1 received only maintenance therapy consisting of alternate administration of 7 drugs, while Group 3 received additional intensification therapy with combination chemotherapy consisting of MTX and Ara-C, followed by a maintenance phase involving the administration of 9 drugs. Group 2 received COPADL induction therapy (CPM, VCR, PRD, ADR, and LASP) and consolidation/intensification therapies followed by a maintenance phase. Group 4 received short-term intensive COPADM polychemotherapy. Twelve patients with localized with localized disease (stage I-II) and 25 patients with advanced disease (stage III-IV) were enrolled in this study. Except for 2 patients in the advanced disease stages who died earlier in the course of the study, all patients remained in remission.
