The expression of the human c-myc protooncogene is subject to many levels and types of control. Evidence suggests that regulation of the expression of this gene involves elements within the gene as well as those upstream from the gene. We show that a ubiquitous mammalian sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, MDBP, binds specifically to a site in the beginning of the first intron of this gene. This protein, which binds to certain viral enhancers, may be helping to control expression of the c-myc gene. In some Burkitt lymphomas, which contain activated c-myc genes, the MDBP site is lost by chromosome rearrangement or by multiple spontaneous mutations. This might contribute to cancer-related activation of this protooncogene.
