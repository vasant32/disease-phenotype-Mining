The human ETS family gene TEL2/ETV7 is highly homologous to TEL1/ETV6, a frequent target of chromosome translocations in human leukemia and specific solid tumors. Here we report that TEL2 augments the proliferation and survival of normal mouse B cells and dramatically accelerates lymphoma development in Emu-Myc transgenic mice. Nonetheless, inactivation of the p53 pathway was a hallmark of all TEL2/Emu-Myc lymphomas, indicating that TEL2 expression alone is insufficient to bypass this apoptotic checkpoint. Although TEL2 is infrequently up-regulated in human sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma, analysis of pediatric B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) samples showed increased coexpression of TEL2 and MYC and/or MYCN in over one-third of B-ALL patients. Therefore, TEL2 and MYC also appear to cooperate in provoking a cadre of human B-cell malignancies.
