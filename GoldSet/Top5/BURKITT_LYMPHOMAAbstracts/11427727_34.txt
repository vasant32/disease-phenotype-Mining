High affinity antibodies are generated in mice and humans by means of somatic hypermutation (SHM) of variable (V) regions of Ig genes. Mutations with rates of 10(-5)--10(-3) per base pair per generation, about 10(6)-fold above normal, are targeted primarily at V-region hot spots by unknown mechanisms. We have measured mRNA expression of DNA polymerases iota, eta, and zeta by using cultured Burkitt's lymphoma (BL)2 cells. These cells exhibit 5-10-fold increases in heavy-chain V-region mutations targeted only predominantly to RGYW (R = A or G, Y = C or T, W = T or A) hot spots if costimulated with T cells and IgM crosslinking, the presumed in vivo requirements for SHM. An approximately 4-fold increase pol iota mRNA occurs within 12 h when cocultured with T cells and surface IgM crosslinking. Induction of pols eta and zeta occur with T cells, IgM crosslinking, or both stimuli. The fidelity of pol iota was measured at RGYW hot- and non-hot-spot sequences situated at nicks, gaps, and double-strand breaks. Pol iota formed T x G mispairs at a frequency of 10(-2), consistent with SHM-generated C to T transitions, with a 3-fold increased error rate in hot- vs. non-hot-spot sequences for the single-nucleotide overhang. The T cell and IgM crosslinking-dependent induction of pol iota at 12 h may indicate an SHM "triggering" event has occurred. However, pols iota, eta, and zeta are present under all conditions, suggesting that their presence is not sufficient to generate mutations because both T cell and IgM stimuli are required for SHM induction.
