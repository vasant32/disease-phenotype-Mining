In the absence of epidemiological surveys, a retrospective analysis of all oral biopsies from 1974-1978 was carried out in order to obtain some knowledge of oral disease experience in Papua New Guinea. The histopathologic distribution of 1060 biopsied lesions was as follows: squamous carcinoma 502 (47%), salivary gland tumours 37 (3%), Burkitt's lymphoma 33 (3%), ameloblastoma 18 (2%), other tumours 48 (5%) and non-neoplastic lesions 422 (40%). The frequency with which oral carcinoma occurs appears to be real and not a statistical artifact. A possible association of salivary gland neoplasia with chronic sialosis is discussed. It is suggested that Burkitt's lymphoma may be overdiagnosed.
