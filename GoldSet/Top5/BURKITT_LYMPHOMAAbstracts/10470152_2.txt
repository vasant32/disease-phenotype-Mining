The cytotoxic activity of three flavonoids, belonging to the kaempherol series, was evaluated against 15 human leukemic cell lines. Flavonoids bearing acyl substituants, 2 and 3, were found to be the most active compounds. A further compound, 1, was examined for its ability to modulate the expression of MDR-1 and GST-pi resistance genes and compounds 2 and 3 for their effect on the uptake of [3H]-thymidine as a marker of DNA synthesis.
