Chromosome studies in a case of T cell lymphoma/leukemia, in which a high proportion of the dividing cells had a t(8;14)(q24;q32) similar to that seen in Burkitt's lymphoma, are described. The tumor cells had a mature T cell phenotype (TdT-,CD3+,CD8+,CD4-) and were morphologically large granular lymphocytes and immunoblasts, both cell types with similar lysosomal granules in the cytoplasm. The immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and the T cell receptor beta chain gene were not rearranged, while the T cell receptor gamma chain gene was polyclonally rearranged. Mitoses were obtained only from spontaneously dividing cells in the absence of mitogens; 49 of the 50 metaphases analyzed were chromosomally abnormal and had a t(1;22)(q12;q13) and dup(1)(q31q32) in all of them; 48 metaphases had in addition a t(8;14)(q24;q32) which presumably arose during clonal evolution. The latter may be associated with the aggressive behavior of this T cell disorder by comparison with other proliferations of large granular lymphocytes. Although abnormalities involving 14q32 are characteristic of B cell disorders, they have also been described in T cell malignancies, suggesting that genes transcribed in T cells and/or oncogenic sequences significant in T cell neoplasia are present in 14q32.
