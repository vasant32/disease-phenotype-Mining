Intravenous urography was performed in 13 patients with Burkitt's lymphoma and showed that 4 cases had bilateral diffuse renal lymphomatous deposits. Back pressure changes due to ureteric compression by abdominal or pelvic masses was recorded in 5 cases and lateral displacement of the ureter in 3 cases. One patient showed bilateral poor excretion of contrast medium while 2 cases had extrinsic impressions on the urinary bladder. Intravenous urography was helpful in determining the extent of urinary tract involvement in Burkitt's lymphoma and serves as an important diagnostic tool in the investigation of patients with urinary tract symptoms or signs in this disease.
