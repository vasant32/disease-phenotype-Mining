The soluble complement-fixing antigen of the P3HR-1 Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, identified with human serum containing antibody against Epstein-Barr virus viral capsid antigen, loses activity under a variety of conditions. The major characteristic reported here is retention of activity on exposure to specific physical or chemical conditions followed by loss of activity after subsequent neutral dialysis. Antigen of untreated cell lysates, which retains activity after dialysis against large volumes of neutral buffers or 0.14 M NaCl, will lose activity if the lysate is first heated to 56 degrees or if the lysate is exposed to acid perchlorate, and the resulting precipitate and supernatant are redialyzed separately to neutral pH. The P3HR-1 soluble complement-fixing antigen appears to be an aggregate including a labile, dissociable component.
