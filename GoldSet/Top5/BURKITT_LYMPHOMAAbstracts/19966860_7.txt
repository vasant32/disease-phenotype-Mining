Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is noted for its transforming potential. Yet, it also acts as a cytostatic and growth-relenting factor in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells. The underlying molecular mechanisms of the growth inhibitory property of LMP1 have remained largely unknown. In this study, we show that LMP1 negatively regulates a major oncogene, TCL1, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and BL cells. MicroRNA (miR) profiling of LMP1 transfectants showed that among others, miR-29b, is upregulated. LMP1 diminished TCL1 by inducing miR-29b through C-terminus activation region 1 (CTAR1) and CTAR2. miR-29b locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotide transfection into LMP1-expressing cells reduced miR-29b expression and consequently reconstituted TCL1, suggesting that LMP1 negatively regulates TCL1 through miR-29b upregulation. The miR-29b increase by LMP1 was due to an increase in the cluster pri-miR-29b1-a transcription, derived from human chromosome 7. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we found that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-activating function of LMP1 is important for this effect. The ability of LMP1 to negatively regulate TCL1 through miR-29b might underlie its B-cell lymphoma growth antagonistic property. As LMP1 is also important for B-cell transformation, we suggest that the functional dichotomy of this viral protein may depend on a combination of levels of its expression, lineage and differentiation of the target cells and regulation of miRs, which then directs the outcome of the cellular response.
