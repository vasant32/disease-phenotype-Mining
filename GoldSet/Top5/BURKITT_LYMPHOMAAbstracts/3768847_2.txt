Chromosomes with various degrees of centromere spreading and completely separated chromatids, as well as metaphasic chromosomes, were observed simultaneously in the same Burkitt's lymphoma cell. In another study, a pair of prematurely and completely separated chromatids was found in a metaphase of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell. Based on these and other observations, the possible significance of centromere spreading and out-of-phase sister chromatid separation in the origin of chromosome nondisjunction in tumor cells is suggested and discussed.
