Cells of the Raji and NC37 lines can be induced by chemical inducers, such as BrdUrd and IdUrd, or the tumor-promoter TPA to EA-expression only, but do not reveal any VCA synthesis. After superinfection by nontransforming P3HR-1 EBV, however, a varying percentage of the cell population shows VCA synthesis and releases infectious viral particles. The recovered virus differs biologically from P3HR-1 EBV since it transforms human umbilical cord blood lymphocytes into EBNA-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines. Cells of these established lines are susceptible to renewed infection by P3HR-1 EBV which results in EA induction and VCA synthesis. Only cells of one line, NC37-R1, spontaneously produce VCA and EBV particles, which reveal transforming properties and do not induce EA upon superinfection of Raji cells. Infection of P3HR-1 EBV-converted BJA-B cells also leads to EA and VCA induction and the release of viral particles. In contrast to particles recovered from Raji and NC37 cells, no transforming activity was detectable in these virus preparations. According to these data, we propose that viral genomes persisting within Raji and NC37 cells are defective and become complemented by the superinfecting P3HR-1 virus.
