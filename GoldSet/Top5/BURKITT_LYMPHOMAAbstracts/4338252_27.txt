Burkitt lymphoblastoid cell lines have been fused to mouse and human cell lines with the use of inactivated Sendai virus. The heterokaryons have developed into somatic cell hybrids of both parental cell types. Chromosome analyses confirm that cells now growing in selective medium are hybrids. Initial observations of preparations of the hybrid cells reveal that 5'-iododeoxyuridine can induce continued synthesis of Epstein-Barr virus antigens by these hybrid cells.
