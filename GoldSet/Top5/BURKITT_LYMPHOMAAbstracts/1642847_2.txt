Necrotizing myocarditis due to Aspergillus fumigatus was a contributory cause of death in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and non-Hodgkin lymphoblastic malignant lymphoma of the Burkitt type. A transient remission of the lymphoma had been obtained by cytostatic treatment. A. fumigatus was isolated from blood two weeks before death, but myocarditis was not diagnosed until autopsy.
