This study was designed to determine the potential role of survivin in the pathogenesis of BurkittÂ´s lymphoma (BL) and analyzing the relationship of its expression with response to therapy. The expression of survivin was investigated in seven archival tumor tissues of BL using the streptavidin-biotin complex technique. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that survivin expression was positive in 6 of 7 BL cases (85.7%). BL group with high survivin expression had poor response to chemotherapy than the group with low survivin expression (P=0.005). The results suggest that apoptosis inhibition by survivin is a significant prognostic parameter of poor response to chemotherapy in Burkitt's lymphoma.
