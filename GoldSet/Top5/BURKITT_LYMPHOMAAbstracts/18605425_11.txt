The neutralization of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infectivity by sera with known antibody activities against EBV-associated antigens was investigated in experimentally infected Raji and RPMI 64-10 cells. Antibodies against EBV-induced cell-membrane antigens were apparently responsible for neutralization of viral infectivity. Antibodies against EBV capsid antigens and EBV-induced early antigens were not involved. The implication of these results on the relationship of the membrane antigens to the infectious virus particle is discussed.
