Glucocorticoid hormones penetrate rapidly into intact lymphoblastoid cells and are retained with the same high affinity and specificity as with cytoplasmic extracts. Optimal conditions for lethal glucocorticoid responses in vitro were determined for a series of human lymphoblastoid cell lines by using different glucocorticoid preparations, and steroid solvents and by varying the cell density. Kinetic studies revealed that lethal glucocorticoid effects are dose-dependent and that continuous exposure of cells to steroid is necessary for progression of lethal effects to occur. Even under optimal conditions, human lymphoblastoid cells only exhibit a marked cytolethal response to glucocorticoids at concentrations which greatly exceed both physiological and therapeutically attainable steroid levels. They are also greatly in excess of steroid levels required to saturate the cytoplasmic receptors of intact or disrupted lymphoblastoid cells. It is suggested that either lethal steroid mechanisms in vitro differ fundamentally from those in vivo or the pharmacological activity of glucocorticoids in vivo does not involve a direct cytolethal action.
