A retrospective clinical and histologic analysis of data on 60 cases of lymphoma of small non-cleaved follicular center cells (Lukes-Collins classification) was carried out. 19 cases were classified as Burkitt's lymphoma and 41 as non-Burkitt's. Non-Burkitt's lymphomas showed more diverse cellularity. Age distribution was bimodal in both subgroups. Half the patients irrespective of histology had stage III or IV disease. GI tract involvement was similarly frequent in both groups. Lymphadenopathy was slightly more frequent in patients with non-Burkitt's lymphoma. Median survival time was as low as 9.2 months for Burkitt's and 14.8 months for non-Burkitt's lymphoma (difference not statistically significant).
