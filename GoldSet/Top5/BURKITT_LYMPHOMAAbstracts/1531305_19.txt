The leukocyte common antigen (CD45) was detected on the surface of leukemic cells in 217 (87%) of 249 cases of newly diagnosed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). All 55 cases of T-lineage ALL, compared with 159 of 191 B-lineage cases, expressed the CD45 antigen (P = .0005). The frequency of CD45 expression did not differ between cases of early pre-B (CD19+, cytoplasmic mu-) and pre-B (CD19+, cytoplasmic mu+) ALL. Cases of ALL lacking CD45 had significantly lower leukocyte counts (P = .002) and serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (P = .007) and were more likely to have leukemic cell hyperdiploidy greater than 50 (P less than .0001) or a DNA index greater than 1.15 (P less than .0001), as compared with cases positive for the antigen. Of the 130 patients whose follow-up duration was sufficient for analysis of event-free survival, the 53 with the highest levels of CD45 expression (greater than or equal to 90%) were the most likely to have an adverse event on intensive multiagent chemotherapy. Patients without detectable CD45 had a negligible risk of failure. This study suggests a relationship between the expression of the CD45 antigen on leukemic lymphoblasts and other biologic factors that influence prognosis in ALL.
