Bortezomib, an inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, is currently approved for treatment of multiple myeloma and is being studied for therapy of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We found that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B cells with type III latency were more susceptible to killing by bortezomib than those with type I latency. Bortezomib induced apoptosis of EBV lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) by inducing cleavage of caspases 8 and 9; apoptosis was inhibited by pretreatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor. Bortezomib reduced the levels of the p50 and p65 components of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway and reduced the level of p52 in the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway, which is induced by EBV LMP1. Bortezomib inhibited expression of cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP, which are regulated by NF-kappaB and function as inhibitors of apoptosis. Bortezomib did not inhibit expression of several other antiapoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Finally, bortezomib significantly prolonged the survival of severe combined immunodeficiency mice inoculated with LCLs. These findings suggest that bortezomib may represent a novel strategy for the treatment of certain EBV-associated lymphomas.
