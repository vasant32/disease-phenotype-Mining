The ability of extracts of a range of cell lines to release methylated bases from a DNA substrate, which had been modified with [3H]dimethyl sulphate, has been compared in cell lines with differing sensitivity to the cytotoxic drug, temozolomide. High performance liquid chromatography profiles of the bases released by these extracts showed that the activity was specific for 3-methyladenine. There was little variation in the level of 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase between the different cell lines despite a 40-fold difference in sensitivity to temozolomide and no correlation with the level of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase.
