Partial excess of chromosome 1 (q25-q32) was noted in malignant cells from all of 10 patients who had disorders such as non-African Burkitt's lymphoma, adult T-cell leukemia, myelofibrosis, malignant lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or chronic myelocytic leukemia in blast crisis. The break points on chromosome 1 were at centromere, q12, q21, q23, q25 and q32. Variations in the specific region of the long arm of chromosome 1, q25-q32, were thought to be important in the evolution of malignant cell proliferation.
