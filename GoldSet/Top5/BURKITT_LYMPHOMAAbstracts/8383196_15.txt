Recent work has shown that p53 gene mutations are frequently found in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive and EBV-negative cases of Burkitt's lymphoma but not in EBV-associated undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs). Similar viral gene expression patterns are observed in undifferentiated NPCs and in EBV-positive cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD), suggesting that the contribution of the virus to the pathogenesis of these malignancies may also be similar. We have analysed 116 cases of HD for EBV association and for immunohistologically detectable overexpression of p53. p53 overexpression was detected in the tumour cell population of 37 (32 per cent) of the cases. Fifteen cases showed p53-specific labelling of more than 40 per cent of tumour cells; in six of these, virtually all tumour cells were stained. In eight cases, between 5 and 40 per cent of tumour cells were labelled, and in another 14 cases, less than 5 per cent of tumour cells expressed detectable amounts of p53. EBV-positive HD cases were found in all groups with different levels of p53 overexpression as well as amongst p53-negative cases. While a more detailed analysis of the p53 gene in HD is required, these data show that overexpression of p53 in HD is heterogeneous and that there is no simple correlation between EBV infection and p53 overexpression.
