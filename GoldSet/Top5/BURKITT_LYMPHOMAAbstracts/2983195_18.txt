Somatic cell hybrids, obtained after fusion of translocation (11;22)-positive Ewing sarcoma cells and Chinese hamster fibroblasts, were assayed for the presence of immunoglobulin C lambda, Philadelphia chromosome breakpoint cluster region, and c-sis oncogene sequences. It was found that c-sis was translocated from chromosome 22 to chromosome 11 in the Ewing sarcoma cells used, indicating that the breakpoint must be proximal to this locus. Moreover, we found that the chromosome 22-linked C lambda and breakpoint cluster region sequences are not translocated. This result confirms an earlier cytogenetic observation that the Ewing sarcoma-associated breakpoint in chromosome 22 is distal to those observed in translocation (8;22)-positive Burkitt lymphoma and in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia.
