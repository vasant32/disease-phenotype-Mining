Burkitt's lymphoma is a monoclonal proliferation of B lymphocytes classified histologically as a poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma. The jaw and retroperitoneal structures are the most commonly involved sites. Prognosis is highly dependent on the stage of the disease. In some cases, the first manifestation of Burkitt's lymphoma is in the jaws, and symptoms may be misdiagnosed as infection. Dental radiographs can play an important role in the diagnosis. A case of a peculiar Burkitt's lymphoma involving the mandible that was misdiagnosed as an acute dentoalveolar abscess is presented.
