Localization of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA was studied by in situ hybridization on chromosomes from the Namalwa Burkitt lymphoma cell line and from a lymphoblastoid cell line transformed in vitro (ATL9/g). The five chromosome bands 1p32, 1q31, 5q21, 13q21, and 16p13 showed the presence of EBV DNA in both of the lines. Grain deposition at the site on chromosome 1q of the Burkitt line was particularly intense. It was also found that EBV DNA in the lymphoblastoid cell line co-localized with a stable achromatic gap at 1p32 whose presence seems to confer a proliferative advantage on the cells.
