The SCL gene encodes a member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of transcription factors and is reportedly involved in up to 25% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We have surveyed over 120 primary human tumors including melanomas, myeloid, and lymphoid leukemias, and other solid tumors without evidence of rearrangements involving SCL. These results are further supported by low level expression of SCL in these tumors (as assessed by a polymerase chain-reaction-based method). We conclude that rearrangement/translocation with subsequent activation of SCL occurs infrequently in myeloid leukemias and melanomas.
