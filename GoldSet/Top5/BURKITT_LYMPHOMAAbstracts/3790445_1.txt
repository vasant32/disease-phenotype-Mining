Severe disseminated intravascular coagulation was observed in a patient with Burkitt's lymphoma/leukaemia. Immunological studies on leukaemic blasts from relapsed bone marrow revealed a B-cell phenotype (B4+, B1+, HLA-Dr+, J5+) with membrane bound IgM lambda. Cytogenetic investigation revealed a variant Burkitt's translocation t(8;22)(q24;q11) involving the lambda light chain gene region and abnormalities of chromosomes 15 and 17 with breakpoints at q22 and q12 respectively, similar to those observed in the t(15;17) in acute promyelocytic leukaemia. Transmission electron microscopy of the leukaemic blasts showed crystalline cytoplasmic inclusions which may have had a role in precipitating the disseminated intravascular coagulation.
