The control of communicable diseases, malnutrition and birth complications has been the main preoccupation of the Member States of the African Region of WHO. As a result of these control measures, death rates, particularly among infants and young children, have continued to decline. This has increased life expectancy to the extent that we are now witnessing the emergence of the diseases prevalent in the industrial world: they have already become a major public health problem in Africa. Carcinoma of the cervix and hepatocellular carcinoma are the commonest forms of cancer afflicting the people of this Region. Others include cancers of the breast, skin, prostate, oesophagus, stomach and bladder. Burkitt's lymphoma is the commonest childhood malignancy. The causal factors of some of these tumours are known, and can therefore be eliminated by primary prevention. This is shown by the almost total absence of carcinoma of the penis in those communities that practise male circumcision, and the decrease in the incidence of squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin that resulted from the prevention of tropical ulcer, thanks to effective care of injuries and wounds. The priorities of the WHO cancer programme are therefore primary prevention, early detection and the provision of adequate pain relief. The success of the programme will depend mainly on whether the services provided will benefit the majority of the population.
