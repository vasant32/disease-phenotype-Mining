Sialic acids are critical components of many glycoconjugates involved in biologically important ligand-receptor interactions. Quantitative and structural variations of sialic acid residues can profoundly affect specific cell-cell, pathogen-cell, or drug-cell interactions, but manipulation of sialic acids in mammalian cells has been technically limited. We describe the finding of a previously unrecognized and efficient uptake and incorporation of sialic acid analogues in mammalian cells. We added 16 synthetic sialic acid analogues carrying distinct C-1, C-5, or C-9 substitutions individually to cell cultures of which 10 were readily taken up and incorporated. Uptake of C-5- and C-9-substituted sialic acids resulted in the structural modification of up to 95% of sialic acids on the cell surface. Functionally, binding of murine sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin-2 (Siglec-2, CD22) to cells increased after N-glycolylneuraminic acid treatment, whereas 9-iodo-N-acetylneuraminic acid abolished binding. Furthermore, susceptibility to infection by the B-lymphotropic papovavirus via a sialylated receptor was markedly enhanced following pretreatment of host cells with selected sialic acid analogues including 9-iodo-N-acetylneuraminic acid. This novel experimental strategy allows for an efficient biosynthetic engineering of surface sialylation in living cells. It is versatile, extending the repertoire of modification sites at least to C-9 and enables detailed structure-function studies of sialic acid-dependent ligand-receptor interactions in their native context.
