The immunological classification of 28 high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) in children was shown. The morphological classification was based on Working Formulation, the immunological classification--on acute lymphoblastic leukemia subtypes. The phenotypes were assayed cytofluorometrically with monoclonal antibodies and compared to ontogenic stages in B and T cell development. Small non-cleaved cell lymphoma (Burkitt's type) was seen in 13 patients, lymphoblastic lymphoma in 12 patients, low differentiated in 3 patients. Immunological classification showed B-lymphocyte origin of blast cells in 15 patients including 11 small non-cleaved Burkitt's lymphoma (mature B and cALL phenotype), 3 undifferentiated cases (pro-B and mature B cell) and 1 case of lymphoblastic lymphoma (cALL type). T-cell origin of blast cells was demonstrated in 13 patients. The immunological classification used routinely was helpful in selection of patients with unfavourable prognosis. The more precise description of blast cells was valuable for better adjustment of therapy and better prognosis.
