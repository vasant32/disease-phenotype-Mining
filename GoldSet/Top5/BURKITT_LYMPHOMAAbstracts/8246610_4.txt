The culture supernatants from 43 human cell lines obtained during log phase and from purified normal peripheral blood B-lymphocytes cultured at 10(6) cells ml-1 for 48 h in RPMI 1640-5% fetal calf serum were examined for interleukin-8 (IL-8) using Elisa kits. Constitutive IL-8 production was found for 14/15 B-cell lines (5 derived from normal persons and 2 from AML patients, 1 pre-B-ALL, 2 CLL with trisomy 12, 2 HTLV-I+, 1 HTLV-II+, 1/2 Burkitt lymphoma), 4/16 T-cell lines (3/6 HTLV-I+, 1 HTLV-II+, 0/9 T-ALL), myeloid line HL-60, monocytoid line U937, 3/3 ovarian carcinoma, 1/1 endometriosis, 2/2 normal fibroblast, 0/2 C-ALL, 0/1 pre-erythroid line K562, as well as for normal B-lymphocytes. Later, cells examined by indirect immunofluorescence using IL-8 antibodies gave a positive reaction. DNA from 4 IL-8 producing and 3 non-producing cell lines, when probed with IL-8 cDNA gave the same 3.5 kb EcoRI fragment indicating similarities of the IL-8 gene in these cells. Two B-cell lines examined showed the expression of 1.8 kb IL-8 mRNA. These results indicate IL-8 production by a greater variety of cells than previously believed which open possibilities for new IL-8-mediated immune functions by such cells as B-cells.
