Small transformed cell lymphoma (STC) is the least common follicular center cell neoplasm in the Lukes-Collins classification system. If the cells are homogenous in size and shape, Burkitt's lymphoma (STC-BL) is diagnosed; otherwise STC lymphoma of the non-Burkitt's type (STC-nBL) is present. The authors have reviewed their experience with 17 cases of STC-nBL. This neoplasm affects all ages, both sexes equally, and most commonly is Stage IV based either on a visceral abdominal mass or bone marrow involvement. Surface immunoglobulin analysis revealed IgM in all cases tested. In spite of aggressive treatment protocols, there were only 5 of 17 (29%) clinical complete responses. Four of these five have continuous remission from 8 to 23 months after diagnosis; all four of these patients were treated with regimens containing high-dose cyclophosphamide. Future analyses including viral studies, chromosomal analyses, and uniform treatment protocols will help determine whether STC-nBL and Burkitt's lymphoma are truly distinct entities.
