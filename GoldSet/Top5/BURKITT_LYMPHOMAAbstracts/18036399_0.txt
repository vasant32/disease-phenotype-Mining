Association of a t(9;22)(q34;q11), BCR/ABL-positive, with a dic(19;21)(p13;p13) has been described in acute lymphoblastic leukemia in relapse, raising the question of whether this association is recurrent. Described here are two cases, one of myeloproliferative disease and one of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, both presenting a masked t(9;22) and t(19;21). Chromosomal rearrangements were ascertained by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using locus-specific probes, multicolor FISH, and bacterial artificial chromosome array. These additional observations suggest a nonrandom association.
