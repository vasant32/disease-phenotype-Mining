The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to study clonality in a group of children with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) results in a hypervariable sequence known as the complementarity determining region III. This can be amplified by the PCR using one pair of consensus primers. The PCR product is highly clone-specific in both size and sequence. Successful amplification was achieved in 50 of 62 cases of B-lineage ALL studied (81%). Both DNA and RNA gave almost identical results. In contrast amplification was only achieved in 2 of 42 control cases (non-B-lineage leukaemias, normal and reactive marrows); these were both cases of T-ALL with IgH rearrangement on Southern blotting. The main advantages of this technique over Southern blot assessment of clonality are the short time to result and requirement for much less DNA allowing study of small samples eg cerebrospinal fluid and testicular biopsies. It is also generally more sensitive for the detection of a malignant clone in a polyclonal marrow cell population and forms the basis of techniques to study minimal residual disease (MRD).
