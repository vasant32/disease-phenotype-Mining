Thirteen cell lines of tissue culture originated from human malignant neoplasms were transplanted into cheek pouches of adult golden hamsters treated with anti-hamster thymocyte serum. In eleven cell lines, transplantation tests with 3.5 X 10(6) to 6.8 X 10(6) cells resulted in neoplastic growth within 4 weeks. In other two cell lines including one from neuroblastoma and another from Burkitt's lymphoma, the inoculum size had to be raised to 11.8 X 10(6) and 12.2 X 10(6) cells to get tumor growth, respectively. The histological appearance of those tumors was consistent with that of the individual primary neoplasms despite of their long in vitro histories. Anaplasia grading of the tumors appeared not to be correlated with the frequency of take.
