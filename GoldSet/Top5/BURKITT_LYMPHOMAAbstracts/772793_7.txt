IgM antibodies reacting in the cold with surface antigens of normal human blood lymphocytes were demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence (IFL) in cold-agglutinin-positive sera from 21 patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infection. Twenty to fifty per cent of the lymphocytes were stained. MP sera reacted also with 75%-100% of cells from two lymphoblastoid cell lines and one Burkitt lymphoma line and with about 80% of peripheral blood lymphocytes from one patient with chronic lymphatic leukaemia. The IFL reaction was negative with cells from leukaemic lymphoid T-cell line (Molt-4). Lymphocyte fractionation experiments gave no evidence of a selective reactivity of MP sera and B or T lymphocytes of peripheral blood. Removal of cold agglutinins from the MP sera by absorption with human O erythrocytes significantly reduced the IFL reactivity with lymphocytes and lymphoblastoid cells, indicating the presence of I antigen on these cells. Furthermore, lymphoblastoid cells but not Molt lymphoid cells absorbed out most of the cold erythroagglutinins.
