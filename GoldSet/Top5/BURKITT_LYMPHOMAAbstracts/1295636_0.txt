Our data suggest that ex vivo bone marrow purging using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and sheep-anti-mouse immunobeads (SAM beads) prior to autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) allows satisfactory tumor cell reduction without critical stem cell losses. Nevertheless, there is only a reduction but no elimination of tumor cells. The consequences will have to be clinically discussed.
