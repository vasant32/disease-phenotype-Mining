Alemtuzumab is effective in reducing the risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Alemtuzumab may also delay immune reconstitution and reduce graft-versus-leukemia effects. The optimal dose has not been established. We investigated engraftment, acute GVHD incidence and severity, and pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab associated with the use of low-dose alemtuzumab/cyclophosphamide/total body irradiation and ASCT for patients with aggressive CD52-positive hematologic malignancies. In all, 12 patients were treated. Alemtuzumab 10 mg daily on days -7 to -3 was given intravenously. Tacrolimus and methotrexate were used for GVHD prophylaxis. Alemtuzemab was not detected in any of the 36 sequential serum samples tested between days -1 and +21 of transplant. All patients engrafted rapidly; the median time to an absolute neutrophil count >0.5 x 10(9)/l was 14 days (range 11-17 days), and the median time to a platelet count >20 x 10(9)/l was 16 days (range 6-30 days). By 1 month after transplant, nine patients had 100% donor chimerism, while three had mixed donor chimerism. At 3 months, 11 had achieved 100% donor chimerism. No cases of grade III/IV acute GVHD occurred. At a median follow-up interval of 14.7 months (range 4-24), seven patients remained alive, and five remained free of disease.
