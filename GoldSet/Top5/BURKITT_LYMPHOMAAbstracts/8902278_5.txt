(E)-2-Hexenal (hexenal), a natural flavor compound, acts as directly genotoxic agent and forms cyclic 1,N2-propano adducts with deoxyguanosine. Formation of this adduct in isolated DNA and in cells was studied with a modified 32P-postlabeling procedure including HPLC separation, nuclease P1 enrichment, two-dimensional TLC of adducted nucleotide bisphosphates on PEI-cellulose, and quantification of adduct spots by liquid scintillation counting. Adduct formation with the more reactive crotonaldehyde was included for comparison. Synthesized adducted dG-3'-phosphates served as external standards for identification and quantification. In calf thymus DNA, hexenal (0.2 mM) shows a time dependent formation of adducts, yielding 1.55 pmol/mumol of DNA at 5 h incubation. With crotonaldehyde (0.2 mM) the adduct rate was about 10-fold higher. Hexenal also generated 1,N2-propano-dG adducts in the human lymphoblastoid Namalva cell line (0.2 mM, 1 h, 86 fmol/mumol of DNA) and in primary rat colon mucosa cells (0.4 mM, 30 min, 50 fmol/mumol of DNA). In primary colon mucosa cells from rats and humans, hexenal and crotonaldehyde (0.4 mM, 30 min) induced DNA damage, detected by single cell microgel electrophoresis (comet assay). In primary rat gastric mucosa cells, hexenal was only weakly active, inducing detectable DNA damage in 20% of cells at 0.8 mM concentration. In contrast, primary mucosa cells from rat esophagus were as sensitive as colon cells. After single oral application of hexenal to rats (up to 320 mg/kg body wt) DNA damage was not detectable in gastrointestinal mucosa. Analysis of hexenal in selected flavored foods revealed concentrations up to 14 ppm (0.14 mM) that are comparable to its natural occurrence in some fruits and vegetables (up to 30 ppm). Thus, the concentration range selected for the toxicological studies described here clearly is relevant: Hexenal, at concentrations found in food, exerts genotoxic effects in cells from rat and human gastrointestinal tract.
