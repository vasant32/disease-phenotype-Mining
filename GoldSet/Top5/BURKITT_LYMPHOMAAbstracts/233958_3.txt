Before and/or after chemotherapy was administered to patients with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) or lymphoblastic lymphosarcoma (LLS), their sera and those of matched controls were tested for antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) capsid antigen (VCA) and early antigen by the indirect immunofluorescence method. Ten of the 16 BL patients were Arab children and 8 of the 11 LLS patients were Jews of Asian-African origin. Although half the BL patients did not have elevated antibody titers when their disease was diagnosed, significantly higher ones were detected in the BL group as compared with the LLS patients and their matched controls; Arab patients had the highest titers. IgM antibodies specific for VCA were found in 2 patients concurrently with elevated titers. We found no correlation between the clinical course of BL and the patients' antibody titers to EBV.
