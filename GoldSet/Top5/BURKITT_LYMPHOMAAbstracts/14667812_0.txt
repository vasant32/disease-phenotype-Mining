Representational difference analysis, a cDNA subtraction approach, was used to identify genes that are expressed in acute leukemia but not in normal hematological tissues. We isolated a cDNA fragment from a cell line derived from a B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia bearing two Philadelphia chromosomes. The cDNA derives from an orphan gene that was named BLACE. BLACE is located in region 7q36 and encodes a major 5.3-kb transcript and several alternatively spliced minor transcripts. Significant expression of BLACE was detected by RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR in bone marrow samples from B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. BLACE was not or was scarcely expressed in other types of hematological malignancies, in normal tissues, and in solid tumors.
