Glutamin (asparagin)ase from Pseudomonas boreopolis 526 is shown to produce a cytotoxic effect on the human ovary carcinoma cells (CaOv line), Fisher lympholeukemia (L-8 line) and Burkitt's lymphoma cells (P3HR line). A significant inhibition of the DNA synthesis is found in L-8 and P3HR cell lines. The enzyme is less active in the cells of the CaOv line.
