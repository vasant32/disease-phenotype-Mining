Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are potentially fatal complications of organ transplants. Impairment of the immune system by immunosuppressive drugs is the assumed cause of PTLD. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is detected in most of the PTLD studied and is considered as the main aetiological agent. The clinical course of PTLD patients remains unpredictable, some lymphoproliferations regress after discontinuation of the immunosuppressive treatment, others behave as true malignant tumours. The mechanism by which a viro-induced lymphoproliferation evolves to an autonomous tumour remains unclear, and little is known about the genetic changes that occur during this process. We report two cases of fatal EBV-associated PTLD in heart transplant recipients. Both tumours were monoclonal and carried numerous chromosomal abnormalities, including a classic t(8;14)(q24;q32) with rearrangement of the MYC proto-oncogene. One tumour demonstrated an amplification of the proto-oncogene N-MYC. The EBNA2 gene was not expressed in tumoral cells, suggesting that the chromosomal abnormalities contributed the function of EBNA2 in these cells. The morphology of the tumours indicated that the cases presented here were not Burkitt's lymphomas. These findings provide some clues with regard to the genetic changes which lead to a B-cell malignancy in some transplant patients.
