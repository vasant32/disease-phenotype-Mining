Three new Epstein-Barr virus DNA populations have been isolated from the recently established Burkitt's lymphoma-derived cell lines, LY47, LY91 and BL8. Each of these lines carries one of the specific chromosome translocations associated with Burkitt's lymphoma but few if any other chromosomal abnormalities. An outline of their molecular organization, as determined by restriction enzyme analysis, is presented. Two of the isolates, LY47 and BL8, give patterns broadly similar to Epstein-Barr virus DNA molecules studied to date. The third, LY91, shows a highly unusual molecular organization, in particular within BamHI subfragments of the EcoRI A fragment, indicative of the presence of a major defective molecular species within this line. All three cell lines produce virions that are capable of transforming immature B-lymphocytes.
