 AIM: To construct the expression vector containing transmembrane domain gene of human CD20 and g3pN1 gene and express the fusion gene high-efficiently in E.coli. METHODS: The human CD20 gene and g3pN1 domain gene were amplified by RT-PCR and PCR from Daudi cells and M13K07 phage antibody library, respectively, and then cloned into expression vector pTIG-Trx. The constructed expression vector was expressed in E.coli. RESULTS: Western blot analysis showed that expressed product could bind to anti-CD20 mAb. CONCLUSION: The pTIG-GS has been constructed and expressed successfully in E.coli, which lays the foundation for further screening anti-CD20 antibody from phage antibody library.
