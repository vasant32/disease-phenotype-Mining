The activation of protooncogenes (ras, fms and myc genes) by point mutations in hematological malignancies are described in this review. Ras mutations are found in a variety of human malignancies at codon 12, 13, and 61. Generally, N-ras mutations are frequent in hematological malignancies. Fms mutation at codon 301 and 969, which are seen in 10 to 20% cases of AML and MDS, increase tyrosine kinase activity of the fms products. Ras and fms mutations are postulated to influence leukemogenesis at rather early stages. Burkitt lymphomas are characterized by specific chromosomal translocations between c-myc gene and one of the immunoglobulin genes. Furthermore, mutations in the 3' border of the exon 1 of c-myc are frequent, and may play an additional role in pathogenesis of Burkitt lymphoma.
