The variant translocations t(2;8) in Burkitt's lymphoma cells join band q24 of chromosome 8, distal from c-myc, to the Igkappa locus, with considerable variation in the location of the breakpoints on chromosome 8. We report the cloning and molecular characterization of a chromosome 8 region, distal from the c-myc locus, which encompasses the breakpoints of the Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines BL64, BL21, and LY91 within 11 kilobase pairs, termed provisionally bvr-1 (Burkitt's variants' rearranging region 1). Using probes from the c-myc, the bvr-1, and the human pvt-1 loci obtained by chromosome walking coupled with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, we have constructed a physical map of the region 3' of c-myc. We map bvr-1 and pvt-1 about 140 and 260 kilobase pairs, respectively, distal from c-myc.
