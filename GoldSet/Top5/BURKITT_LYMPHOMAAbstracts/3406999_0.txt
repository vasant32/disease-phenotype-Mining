A 3-year prospective study undertaken in Harare, Zimbabwe, revealed that the relative frequencies of lymphoreticular and haematological malignancies were similar to those of Western countries, and fitted well into the African pattern except that Hodgkin's disease was relatively less and myeloma relatively more frequent. The distribution of non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma in Zimbabwe corresponds well with the overall trend in Africa, i.e. with the proportion of Hodgkin's disease increasing and that of non-Hodgkin's disease (particularly Burkitt's lymphoma) decreasing on moving away from the equator. The age incidence pattern for Hodgkin's disease was bimodal with the largest peak in adolescence and early adulthood. Disease in very young children was uncommon. In non-Hodgkin's lymphoma the picture was similar to elsewhere in Africa, except that Burkitt's lymphoma was uncommon.
