Combination chemotherapy regimen incorporating CD20 antibodies are commonly used in the treatment of CD20-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Fludarabine phosphate (F-araAMP), cyclophosphamide, and CD20 antibodies (Rituximab) constitute the FCR regimen for treating selected NHL, including aggressive mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). As an alternative to the CD20 antibody, we generated a CD20-targeted measles virus (MV)-based vector. This vector was also armed with the prodrug convertase purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) that locally converts the active metabolite of F-araAMP to a highly diffusible substance capable of efficiently killing bystander cells. We showed in infected cells that early prodrug administration controls vector spread, whereas late administration enhances cell killing. Control of spread by early prodrug administration was also shown in an animal model: F-araAMP protected genetically modified mice susceptible to MV infection from a potentially lethal intracerebral challenge. Enhanced oncolytic potency after extensive infection was shown in a Burkitt's lymphoma xenograft model (Raji cells): After systemic vector inoculation, prodrug administration enhanced the therapeutic effect synergistically. In a MCL xenograft model (Granta 519 cells), intratumoral (i.t.) vector administration alone had high oncolytic efficacy: All mice experienced complete but temporary tumor regression, and survival was two to four times longer than that of untreated mice. Cells from MCL patients were shown to be sensitive to infection. Thus, synergy of F-araAMP with a PNP-armed and CD20-targeted MV was shown in one lymphoma therapy model after systemic vector inoculation.
