We compared the gene expression profile of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to normal hematopoietic and non-ALL samples using oligonucleotide arrays. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was the highest overexpressed gene in B-cell ALL compared with the other groups, and displayed heterogeneous expression, suggesting it might have prognostic relevance. CTGF expression was examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (ORT-PCR) on 79 adult ALL specimens. CTGF expression levels were significantly increased in ALL cases with B-lineage (P < .001), unfavorable cytogenetics (P < .001), and blasts expressing CD34 (P < .001). In a multivariate proportional hazards model, higher CTGF expression levels corresponded to worsening of overall survival (OS; hazard ratio 1.36, for each 10-fold increase in expression; P = .019). Further studies are ongoing to confirm the prognostic value of CTGF expression in ALL and to investigate its role in normal and abnormal lymphocyte biology.
