An Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-producer line, designated Akata, was established from a Japanese patient with Burkitt's lymphoma. The Akata line possessed the Burkitt's-type chromosome translocation, t(8q- ; 14q+), and was derived from the tumor cell. Akata cells produced a large quantity of transforming virus upon treatment of cells with anti-immunoglobulin antibodies (Takada, 1984). Southern blot analysis of viral DNA indicated that the Akata EBV is nondefective and more representative of wild-type viruses. Akata cells should be useful as a source of EBV.
