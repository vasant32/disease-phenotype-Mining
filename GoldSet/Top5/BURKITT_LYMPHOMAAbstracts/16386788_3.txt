Immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement is conventionally used for assessment of lymphoid malignant cells. TCR genes rearrangements were reported to occur at high frequency in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Therefore, we have analyzed 83 children with acute B-lineage ALL (67 de novo patients and 19 relapses) by PCR analysis for clonal IgH, incomplete TCRD (Vdelta2-Ddelta3 and Ddelta2-Ddelta3) and TCRG rearrangements. It was shown that clonal cross-lineage TCR rearrangements were associated with more immature immunophenotype (CD34+, CD117+, CyIgM-) of leukemic cells from patients' bone marrow (BM) samples as compared to cell samples without cross-lineage TCR rearrangements. That was equally detected both in de novo and relapsed cases of disease. Low frequency of clonal TCRG rearrangements was associated with expression of E2A/PBX chimeric oncogene. We suggest that TCRG and TCRD clonal rearrangements in leukemic B-cells are associated with early stages of their differentiation.
