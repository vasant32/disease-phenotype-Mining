We report heteromorphism of the centrometric region of human chromosome 7, which was observed in the cytogenetic assessment of a complete remission of a pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the bone marrow cells of a 25-year-old woman. Classical cytogenetic study was performed, as well as metaphase and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) carried out with an alphoid DNA probe specific for the chromosome 7 centromere for detection of leukemic clones with monosomy 7 found at the initial diagnosis. We show an important centromeric heteromorphism of this chromosome detected by FISH and clearly visible on all metaphases and nuclei analyzed. This heteromorphism is observable as a fluorescent signal five- or sixfold larger than that on the homologue. To our knowledge, this heteromorphism of chromosome 7 has not been reported in the literature. However, with the use of FISH analysis, it could be easily mistaken for a mosaicism of monosomy 7, which can be misleading in the interpretation of the results.
