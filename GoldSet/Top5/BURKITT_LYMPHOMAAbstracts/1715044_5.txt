A rare case of coexistent Burkitt-type lymphoma and meningioma associated with an unruptured cerebral aneurysm is presented. A 49-year-old male complaining of headache and right hemiparesis was admitted to our hospital. Neuroradiological examination revealed a multinodular mass in the left frontal convexity and an unruptured cerebral aneurysm at the M1 portion of the left middle cerebral artery. He underwent an operation for tumor removal and aneurysm clipping. Histological examination revealed the tumor to be a typical meningotheliomatous meningioma without malignancy. However, a second operation was necessary for another tumor invading into the left frontal lobe, which proved to be a Burkitt-type lymphoma. The second tumor may have been resulted from irritative effect of the first tumor, but the aneurysm was considered purely coincidental.
