Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the peripheral blood of patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT) and EBV genome-positive Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) were tested for expression of EBV-related lytic antigens by means of irradiation. We used 1 Gy in each experiment, according to the results of the P3HR-1 (derived from African BL) cell line. Significantly higher expression of early antigens (EA) and viral capsid antigen (VCA) was demonstrated in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from both patients with AT and those with EBV genome-positive BL, as compared to those derived from healthy individuals. These results suggested that defective regulating mechanisms on B lymphocytes, responsible for EBV infection, may underlie for the pathogenesis of development of lymphoproliferative diseases both in patients with AT and EBV genome-positive BL.
