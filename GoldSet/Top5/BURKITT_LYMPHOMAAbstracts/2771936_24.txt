We have used cell-free DNA replication to study the relationship between DNA replication and chromatin assembly. As others have reported, we find that DNA replication facilitates nucleosome assembly. We show here that replication-dependent nucleosome assembly occurs in at least two steps. The first step requires replicating DNA; the second step occurs after replication has been completed and is promoted by a nuclear extract. Consistent with this multistep model, we observe that the replicated simian virus 40 minichromosome is organized into a repeating array of DNA-protein particles that are structurally distinct from mature nucleosomes. These particles may be precursors in a pathway of nucleosome assembly since in the second, replication-independent step the nuclear extract converts this nascent chromatin into nucleosomes.
