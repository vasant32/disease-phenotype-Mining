Of 290 Ugandan children and adolescents with proven Burkitt's lymphoma 11 had lesions in the long bones or the pelvis. These started in the medulla as small osteolytic foci which coalesced and penetrated the cortex causing subperiosteal new bone formation in layers or spicules, and giving rise to large soft-tissue masses. Common sites were the femoral and tibial diaphyses and the metaphyses around the knee. Five were in the epiphyses. Other sites were the pelvis, humerus and ulna. One patient had a lymphomatous synovial effusion of the knee. In the lower limbs the lesions were often bilateral and symmetrical. Five patients had pathological fractures. Radiologically the lesions mimicked Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, osteomyelitis, acute leukaemia, syphilis and yaws, but clinically they were relatively painless, an important differential diagnostic feature. In the five patients with sustained remissions after chemotherapy the lesions and fractures healed well and the growth plates were undamaged.
