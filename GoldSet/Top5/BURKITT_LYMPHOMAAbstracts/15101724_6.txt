Mammalian cells undergo programmed cell death by orchestrated interactions involving multiple independent pathways. At least one of them, the p53-dependent pathway is commonly compromised in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines. Differences in the integrity of this pathway in various BL cell lines have made them useful experimental models in understanding response to standard or novel antitumor drugs vis-a-vis the p53 pathway. Non-p53-dependent loss of apoptotic regulation also contributes to the genesis and/or progression of lymphomas and it is possible that BL cell lines also represent these models. We have characterized the expression of multiple apoptotic proteins in a panel of BL cell lines and describe cell lines with loss of cIAP1, cIAP2, Bax, Bak, Bcl-Xs and p38 MAP-kinase. This data should make this panel of cell lines a useful screening system for testing novel apoptotic inducers.
