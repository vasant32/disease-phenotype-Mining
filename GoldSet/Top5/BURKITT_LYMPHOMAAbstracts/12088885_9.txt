In this report, we present a novel spectroscopic method of follow-up during chemotherapy treatment for B- and T-cell childhood leukemia patients. We isolated peripheral lymphocytes from blood drawn from patients before and after the chemotherapy and collected Microscopic FTIR (FTIR-MC) spectra of the isolated lymphocytes. Our results showed that nucleic acids content decreased in both types of patients. Changes in phospholipids and proteins level could be observed. The overall effects of drugs administered to the patients can be understood at the molecular level using FTIR-MC and these results are expected to stimulate wider applications of spectroscopy in leukemia research.
