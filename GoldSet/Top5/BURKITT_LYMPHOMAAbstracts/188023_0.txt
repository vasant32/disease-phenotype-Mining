Bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-polyphosphate or 99mTc-pyrophosphate was carried out in 54 children suspected of bone disease. Signs of skeletal metastases were recognized in 13 children by scintigraphy whereas X-ray examination showed lesions in only 10 of these. In 5 children with primary osteosarcoma, three cases of fibrous dysplasia, and 4 cases of osteomyelitis, the lesions were clearly demonstrated by scintigraphy. Abnormal accumulation of radioactivity in soft tissue lesions was observed in primary adrenal neuroblastoma, Hodgkin's granuloma, and metastatic Burkitt's lymphoma. Several cases are reported, and the value of bone scintigraphy in children is discussed.
