We have isolated a human genomic clone for the intermediate filament subunit vimentin with a DNA probe encoding chicken vimentin. We show that the gene for this protein exists as a single copy in the haploid human genome and is transcribed into one mature RNA species of 2 kb. In vitro translation of poly(A)+ mRNA in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system showed that vimentin is a major product of RNA from normal lymphocytes but not of RNA extracted from Burkitt cells. 2-kb vimentin mRNA can be detected with a DNA probe in normal lymphocytes and in fibroblasts, but not in cell lines derived from Burkitt's lymphoma (JI, JBL2, BJAB, DAUDI). The abundance of vimentin mRNA is correlated with the quantity of vimentin present in the cells, suggesting that the level of expression is regulated by the abundance of mRNA. The half-lives of vimentin mRNA were found identical in both fibroblasts and lymphocytes and belong to the class of stable mRNA.
