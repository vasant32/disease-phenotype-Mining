Thirty cases of malignant lymphoma, undifferentiated, Burkitt's type are reviewed. An older median age and a predominance of presentation in abdominal and pelvic sites rather than in the jaw distinguishes this series of American patients from those reported from endemic regions in Africa. Bone marrow involvement invariably consisted of massive infiltration recognizable in smear, clot and biopsy preparations. Involvement of the central nervous system or bone marrow was always associated with short survival. In all eight long-term survivors lymphoma was apparently confined to a single site at presentation. At autopsy, the most consistent finding was widespread multiorgan involvement without predilection for lymphoreticular structures. The histologic appearance of the tumor changed after chemotherapy, varying from diffuse necrosis within 48 hours of initial therapy to extreme pleomorphism of tumor cells after 9 months of therapy. In one patient, there was almost complete absence of lymphoma at autopsy in an organ site shown clinically to have been extensively involved by tumor prior to treatment. The diagnostic and therapeutic implications of these findings are discussed.
