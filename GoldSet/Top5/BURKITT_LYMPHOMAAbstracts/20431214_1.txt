 BACKGROUND: Information concerning the frequency and pattern of ovarian tumours in children is scant, more so in northern Nigeria. In view of this, we reviewed ovarian biopsies obtained from children in Zaria over a 25-year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ovarian tumours occurring in 48 patients of age 15 years and below were reviewed and classified using the current World Health Organization (WHO) histological classification of ovarian tumours. RESULTS: Ovarian tumours in children accounted for 8.6% of all cases of tumours seen in all age groups over the period. Among all the malignant tumours seen in this period, 32% occurred in children, and Burkitt's lymphoma accounted for 31.2% of these. Germ cell tumours accounted for 58.0% while epithelial tumours had a frequency of 2.1%. CONCLUSION: Burkitt's lymphoma is the most common childhood ovarian tumour in Zaria, northern Nigeria.
