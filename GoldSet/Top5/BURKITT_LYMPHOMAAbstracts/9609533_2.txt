Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), observed among immunocompromised AIDS patients, has not been reported during chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We report a case of PCNSL occurring in a child receiving intensive multiagent chemotherapy for B-cell ALL. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated Epstein-Barr virus genome in both tumours, suggesting a possible link between the two diseases. The clinical response of the PCNSL to conservative therapy highlights the importance of accurately diagnosing such EBV-related disorders, especially in patients where immune compromise can be reversed.
