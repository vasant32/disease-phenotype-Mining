The early diagnosis of intestinal non-Hodgkin lymphoma, stages I and II, lymphoblastic of Burkitt's type, was made by colonoscopy combined with selective radiologic visualization of the tumor in two children, ages 4 and 5. This technique is recommended in patients with abdominal pain, iron-deficiency anemia, intestinal blood loss, and an elevated sedimentation rate, when conventional radiologic and ultrasound techniques fail.
