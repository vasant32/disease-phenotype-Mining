PURPOSE: The EDPGFFNVE nonapeptide (NP) was recognized as the CD21 (CR2) binding epitope of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gp350/ 220 envelope glycoprotein which mediates the virus attachment to human B lymphocytes (Nemerow et al., Cell 56:369-377, 1989). Here we evaluated the targeting potential of a synthetic receptor binding epitope (NP) covalently attached to a water-soluble polymeric drug carrier. In particular, the biorecognition of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer-NP conjugates by B- and T-cells and the cytotoxicity of HPMA copolymer-NP-adriamycin (ADR) conjugates toward B-cells, T-cells, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were evaluated. METHODS: HPMA copolymer-NP and optionally ADR conjugates varying in the NP density and mode of NP attachment were incubated with Raji B-cells (human Burkitt's lymphoma), CCRF-CEM T-cells (acute human lymphoblastic leukemia), and CCRF-HSB-2 T-cells (human lymphoblastic leukemia). The kinetics of binding was studied, the Langmuir adsorption isotherms analyzed, binding constants calculated, and IC50 doses determined. RESULTS: Flow cytometry studies revealed that binding was homogeneous to both cell types. The apparent binding constants to T-cells were about two times higher when compared to B-cells. The binding and cytotoxicity increased with increased amount of epitopes per polymer chain. Attachment of the NP via a GFLG spacer resulted in increased biorecognition when compared with conjugates containing NP bound via a GG spacer. HPMA copolymer-NP-ADR conjugates possessed specific cytotoxicity to T- and B-malignant cells. Concentrations, which were lethal to the latter, were not toxic for PBL. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained seem to indicate the potential of the HPMA copolymer-NP conjugates as polymer anticancer drug carriers targetable to immunocompetent cells.
