A 71-year-old woman was hospitalized because of hematemesis on December 1, 1987. Her white blood cell (WBC) count was 41,200/microliters with 48% of lymphoblasts, and the bone marrow was hypercellular with more than 90% of blasts. The diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (FAB: L3) was made by morphologic, cytochemical and immunologic studies of the blasts. The examination of fiber gastroscope revealed remarkable varix in the stomach, suggesting portal hypertension accompanied by infiltration of leukemic cells into reticulo-endothelial system. She died of respiratory failure because of bleeding into the trachea. The autopsy disclosed the massive infiltration of leukemic cells into the whole organs. In the chromosome study of the peripheral blood, t(2; 8) and 14q+ were observed, and these chromosomal abnormalities are relatively unusual in patients with Burkitt's lymphoma.
