The morphologic criteria for the two variants of small noncleaved follicular center cell (SNC FCC) lymphoma in the Lukes-Collins classification, Burkitt's (BL) and non-Burkitt's variants (NBL), were evaluated and related to the results of multiparameter laboratory and clinical studies. Forty-two patients were studied: 25 cases were classified as BL according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Seventeen cases were classified as NBL on the basis of greater variability in nuclear size and shape, more prominent nucleoli, and greater variation in the amount of cytoplasm. Neoplastic follicles were present in three cases of BL and two of NBL, indicating an FCC origin for this lymphoma. Electron microscopic examination confirmed the light microscopic features. Immunoglobulin (Ig) monoclonality, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence (surface Ig) and/or immunoperoxidase staining for cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (CIg), was demonstrated in 21 of 24 (87.5%) of BL and 13 of 16 (71%) of NBL. Clinically, BL presented more frequently in extranodal sites and with gastrointestinal involvement than NBL. Bone marrow involvement was more common in NBL patients. Both groups had advanced stage disease at diagnosis. The median survival was 10.5 months in BL and 7.7 months in NBL. The results of this study indicate that BL and NBL are biologically related variants of SNC FCC lymphoma but have different presentations, which may be clinically significant.
