Burkitt's lymphoma is a disease of unique cytokinetics that account for the bulky tumors, variety of presenting symptoms, and sensitivity to chemotherapy. A need to ascertain the role of surgery in the treatment of this illness prompted this review. Of nine children 5 to 12 years of age with Burkitt's lymphoma, eight had abdominal involvement. Two of the eight patients also had oral lesions and staging was done by biopsy of the oral lesion and noninvasive imaging of the abdominal tumors. The other six patients presented with abdominal complaints. One of these had diagnostic paracentesis, another had only gastroscopy, and four underwent exploratory laparotomy. The four children in whom the diagnosis was established either by biopsy of an oral lesion, biopsy of an abdominal mass, or resection of an abdominal tumor are alive without evidence of disease 6 months to 6 years after treatment. Each of these children had rapid initiation of chemotherapy. Of the other four who died, two had delayed induction of drug therapy following cytoreduction or gastroscopic biopsy. The best outcomes were associated with prompt chemotherapy. We conclude that except in rare instances in which a solitary lesion lends itself to total or near-total resection, the proper role of surgery is a simple, safe procedure to obtain enough viable tumor for accurate diagnosis and prompt chemotherapy.
