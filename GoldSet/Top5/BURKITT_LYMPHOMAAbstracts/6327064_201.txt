A chromosomal myc gene displays one of three patterns of activity depending upon the arrangement of the gene and its allelic partner. In nonmalignant B cells both myc alleles are normally expressed. In Burkitt lymphoma cells carrying both a translocated and a nontranslocated myc allele, the translocated allele is inappropriately expressed, while the nontranslocated allele is virtually inactive. Here we examine the chromatin structure of these genes using DNAase I hypersensitivity in nonmalignant lymphoblastoid cells and in the Burkitt lymphoma, BL31 . Three hypersensitivity patterns emerge that correlate with the state of the gene and reveal sites associated with putative regulatory structures. One region is associated with the two myc promoters, one with a specific nuclear protein binding site, and one--which is markedly enhanced in the inactive germline gene in the Burkitt cell--with a putative negative control region. The perturbation of the normal pattern in this particular Burkitt cell may be due to the action of an immunoglobulin enhancer.
