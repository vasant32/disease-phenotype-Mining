We report a case of an atypical myeloproliferative disorder with t(8;13) that presented as B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL). Following induction chemotherapy, the disease manifested as chronic myeloproliferative state, which responded to hydroxyurea. Terminally, the disease transformed into acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with additional chromosomal abnormalities including monosomy 7. To our knowledge, this is the first case of this rare atypical myeloproliferative disorder with t(8;13) that presented as B-ALL and terminally transformed to AML with additional chromosomal abnormalities.
