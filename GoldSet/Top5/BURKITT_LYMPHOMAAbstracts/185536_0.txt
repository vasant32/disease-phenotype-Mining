The presence of antibodies to the virus capsid antigen of the Epstein-Barr virus was established in the sera of children from different forms of neoplasms with the aid of the indirect method of immunofluorescence according to Henle. 69 sera were studied from children with Wilm's tumor, teratoblastoma, reticulosarcoma, neuroblastoma, sarcoma and also from children with benignant tumors. As control served sera from healthy children of corresponding age. As test cells synthesizing the virus capsid antigen the authors utilized a suspension culture of P3HR-I cells, being one of the clones of Burkitt's lymphoma. The performed investigations have shown that in no one group of children with tumor could there be discovered an increase in the content of antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus in comparison to controls. It has also been revealed that the spread of the Epstein-Barr virus in different groups of patients and healthy children fluctuated between 83 and 100%.
