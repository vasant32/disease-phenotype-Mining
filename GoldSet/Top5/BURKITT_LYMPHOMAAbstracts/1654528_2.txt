A 42-year-old man, seronegative for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), received a cadaveric renal transplant. Serology from the 27-year-old male donor indicated an active EBV infection. Following treatment for acute rejection with OKT3 the recipient developed a severe systemic illness. Clinical features strongly suggested an acute EBV infection and serology showed seroconversion for EBV. The patient died and autopsy histology revealed widespread polymorphic lymphocyte infiltration in lymph nodes and solid organs. To our knowledge this is the first report of a kidney being transplanted from a donor who was subsequently shown to have had EBV infection at the time of organ retrieval. The EBV status of an organ donor should be considered more frequently.
