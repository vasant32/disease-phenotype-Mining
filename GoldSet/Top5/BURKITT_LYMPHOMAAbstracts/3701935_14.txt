Analysis of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements in 16 B-cell lineages clonally propagated from two mononucleosis patients supported the notion that mononucleosis is a polyclonal B-lymphoproliferative disorder. Three of seven cell clones from a patient with a fatal B lymphoma revealed the same pattern of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, indicating that this patient's disease was oligoclonal. The three similar clones were propagated from two sites (blood and spleen), indicating that they represent a metastatic cell lineage which arose during the patient's fatal B lymphoproliferation.
