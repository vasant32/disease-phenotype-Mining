The expression of molecules of the beta2 integrin family (CD11a, CD11b , CD11c, and CD18) was explored on 2 human megakaryocytic cell lines and on platelets from different donors by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry using a large panel of mAb. CD11a, CD11b, CD11c and CD18 were detected on the megakaryocytic cell lines DAMI and HEL. A low and variable expression of CD11a, CD11b and CD18 determinants was also detected on resting platelets; this expression was markedly increased when platelets were activated by thrombin. Expression of CD18 was closely correlated to that of CD11a or CD11b when comparing the fluorescence intensity observed in different experiments. In presence of Ca++, platelets did bind to a RAJI cell line which exhibits a high expression level of CD54. This binding was increased when platelets were activated by thrombin and was decreased by an anti CD11a, CD18 and anti CD54 mAb. This study indicates that human platelets express molecules of the beta2 integrin family, when activated, which allows them to bind to CD54 bearing cells.
