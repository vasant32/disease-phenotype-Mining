Twenty-seven Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and 27 EBV-carrying Burkitt-lymphoma-derived lines were analyzed for expression of the second EBV-encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA-2) by immunoblotting and anticomplement immunofluorescence with EBNA-2-specific sera. While all lymphoblastoid cell lines expressed EBNA-2, only 10 of the 27 BL lines were EBNA-2-positive. Comparison of the EBNA-2 coding BamHI W-, Y- and H-fragments of EBV-DNA in the different cell lines by restriction enzyme analysis suggests that EBNA-2 negativity is due either to sequence diversity or to a deletion in the BamHI WYH region.
