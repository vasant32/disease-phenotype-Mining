Previous studies have shown differences in expression levels of apoptosis regulatory proteins in non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) and indicated the correlation of procaspase-3 (proC-3) and caspase-3 activation to the response of chemotherapy. We investigated whether proC-3 expression in tumor biopsies of childhood NHLs is related to clinical outcome. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 58 children with NHL were evaluated for proC-3 expression by immunochemistry analysis. The study included 20 cases of Burkitt lymphoma, 7 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 18 cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and 13 cases of precursor lymphoblastic lymphoma. The highest expression level of proC-3 was observed in ALCL. In the multivariate analysis the higher clinical stage of disease and higher expression level of proC-3 were independent and appear to be significant prognostic factors of treatment failure. Our results suggest that the high expression level of proC-3 may be a powerful independent predictor of response to chemotherapy and progression-free survival in childhood NHLs.
