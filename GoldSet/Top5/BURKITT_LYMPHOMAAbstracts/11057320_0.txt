To address the issue of salvageability in relapsed children with NHL who had all received the same frontline therapy, we retrospectively studied the treatment response and the outcome of 27 children who relapsed following the CCLSG-NHL890 protocol. The reinduction rates and 3-year survival rates (mean +/- SD) were as follows: lymphoblastic lymphoma (LB, n = 9), 44% & 17 +/- 14%; leukemia lymphoma syndrome (LLS, n = 8), 25% & 0%; large cell lymphoma (LC, n = 3) 100% & 67 +/- 27%; Burkitt's lymphoma (B, n = 7) 0% & 0%. Thus, the salvageability of LC lymphoma was good, but the outcome of Burkitt's lymphoma was very poor. CCLSG-NHL960 protocol for LB lymphomas and intensive multiagent regimens for LC lymphomas produced favorable response rates, but the effect of the high-dose Ara-C regimen for Burkitt's lymphoma was not determined. The initial stages of the disease seemed to be associated with the patient outcome: the outcome of the patients in stage IV was inferior to that of patients in stages II or III. Other clinical variables, such as relapse sites, relapse time and BM rescue did not affect the patients' outcome.
