Adult Burkitt's lymphoma is an uncommon disease. Few cases of spinal involvement in adults with sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma are reported in the literature. We present a case of a middle-aged man who was found to have an epidural mass in the thoracic spine when investigated for back pain and lower extremity weakness. He underwent a laminectomy with resection of the epidural mass. Histologic examination revealed a primary Burkitt's lymphoma of the spinal cord. He was treated with aggressive chemotherapy and is now experiencing remission of his disease. We also present a review of the literature for the etiology and clinical features of other spinal lymphomas and Burkitt's lymphoma involving the spine in adults.
