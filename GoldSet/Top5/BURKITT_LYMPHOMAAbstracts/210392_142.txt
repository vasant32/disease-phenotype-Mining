Results from a prospective sero-epidemiological study initiated in Uganda in 1971 indicate that children with high antibody titres to Epstein-Barr virus structural antigens are at high risk of developing Burkitt's lymphoma. These findings strongly support a causal relationship between the Epstein-Barr virus and Burkitt's lymphoma but suggest that the oncogenic potential of the virus is realised only in exceptional circumstances.
