Burkitt's lymphoma involving the pancreas is relatively common at autopsy. In contrast to the typical appearance of carcinoma of the pancreas, Burkitt's lymphoma can present as diffuse enlargement of the entire gland, due to either tumor induced pancreatitis or tumor lysis pancreatitis seen after chemotherapy. Needle biopsy of the enlarged gland, as in the presented case, is capable of distinguishing uncomplicated acute pancreatitis from the pancreatitis associated with Burkitt's involvement of the organ.
