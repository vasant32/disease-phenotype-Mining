Cytogenetic findings on 15 new cell lines established from endemic and nonendemic Burkitt's lymphoma are reported. Specific translocations t(8;14) and t(8;22) were found, respectively, in 13 and in 2 of the cell lines. Particular attention has been paid to the additional chromosome abnormalities found in 10 of the 15 cell lines. These anomalies involve the long arm chromosome No. 1 with a relatively high frequency. These additional chromosome anomalies argue in favor of the concept of the existence of primary and secondary chromosome abnormalities in malignancies.
