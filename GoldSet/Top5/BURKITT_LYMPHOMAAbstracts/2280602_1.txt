The cell-encoded p53 antigen seems to be tightly associated with various human malignancies. We have analyzed biochemical properties of p53 in two different cell lines derived from patients with ALL or ANLL. p53 was found in elevated levels in both leukemic cell lines compared to unstimulated or stimulated normal lymphocytes. High levels of p53 in these cell lines are due to an extended stability of p53 protein rather than to different rates of synthesis. p53 from both cell lines formed low- and high-molecular weight oligomers which revealed that p53 exists in a heterogenous population in these tumor cells. The presence of immunologically different subsets of p53 was demonstrated by sequential immunoprecipitation experiments with different p53 specific monoclonal antibodies. Our results showed structural and immunological variabilities of p53 in cell lines derived from human tumors and may thus provide an insight into the role p53 may play in human malignancies.
