CASE DESCRIPTION: A French Caucasian man aged 39 with HIV infection was treated with abacavir/lamivudine and ritonavir/lopinavir. The patient (normal renal and liver functions) was diagnosed with a Burkitt lymphoma for which he was treated with cyclophosphamide day 1 to 5; doxorubicin day 1; methotrexate day 10; and vincristine day 1 and 8. At day 12, he suffered from abdominal pain associated with constipation. Paralytic ileus was diagnosed by study imaging. Ileus lasted 10 days necessitating parenteral feeding. Later on, a further cycle of chemotherapy with etoposide replacing vincristine was given and was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: We speculate that an interaction between ritonavir/lopinavir and vincristine was responsible for this severe toxicity. Vincristine is transported by P-gp and is metabolized via CYP3A5. Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A5 isoenzyme and P-gp inhibitor. Lopinavir is also a P-gp inhibitor. Ritonavir and lopinavir might have delayed vincristine elimination. Clinicians should be aware of this possible interaction.
