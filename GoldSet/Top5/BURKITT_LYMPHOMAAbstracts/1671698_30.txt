There is now abundant evidence that apoptosis, the cell death mechanism responsible for physiological deletion of cells, can be triggered by mild hyperthermia. However, the overall importance of this mode of death in heated tumours has not yet been established. In this light and electron microscopic study, apoptosis induced by 43 degrees C or 44 degrees C water bath heating for 30 min in a range of murine and human tumours growing in vitro and in four murine tumours growing as solid nodules in vivo, was identified on the basis of its characteristic morphology, and the amount present quantified. Apoptosis was found to play a variable role in the response of tumours to heating, with the lowest levels produced in human melanoma lines (less than 1%) and the highest levels in some Burkitt's lymphoma lines (up to 97%). In these latter tumours the induction of apoptosis is clearly a major component of the hyperthermic response.
