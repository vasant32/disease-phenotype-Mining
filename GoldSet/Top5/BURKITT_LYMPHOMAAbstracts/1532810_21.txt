Human V gamma 9/V delta 2 T cells, the major subset of gamma/delta T cells in peripheral blood of adults, mediate proliferative and cytotoxic responses to Daudi Burkitt's lymphoma cells without previous in vitro exposure to Daudi. Our experiments show that some gamma/delta T cells coexpressing V gamma 9 and V delta 1 genes also react to Daudi cells in cytotoxic and proliferative assays. Expression of V gamma 9 is not sufficient for the recognition of Daudi cells because most gamma/delta T cells expressing V delta 1 paired with V gamma 9 or other V gamma genes neither kill Daudi cells nor proliferate to Daudi. V gamma 9/V delta 2 T cells do not proliferate to other cell lines such as K562 or Molt4 that are sensitive to MHC-unrestricted cytolysis by NK cells and by most IL-2-activated gamma/delta T cell clones. Cold target inhibition assays demonstrate that Daudi cells are stronger inhibitors than K562 and Molt4 of MHC-unrestricted lysis by V gamma 9/V delta 2 clones. However, cold Daudi cells are relatively weaker inhibitors of MHC-unrestricted lysis by NK cell clones, most gamma/delta T cell clones expressing V delta 1 and alpha/beta T cell clones. Thus, recognition by V gamma 9/V delta 2 T cells and certain V gamma 9/V delta 1 T cells of Daudi appears to involve a specific triggering pathway that is distinct from recognition by these gamma/delta T cells of Molt4, K562, and other target cells. NK cell clones and most other gamma/delta and alpha/beta T cell clones derived from the same normal volunteer blood donors do not show this specific interaction with Daudi cells. These data show that distinct subsets of human gamma/delta T cells recognize Daudi cells and support the idea that the gamma/delta TCR may be directly involved.
