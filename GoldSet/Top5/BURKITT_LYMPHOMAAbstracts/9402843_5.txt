PURPOSE: To report an unusual case of orbital involvement with non-African Burkitt lymphoma in a child. METHODS: A 26-month-old boy developed oral thrush and painless right proptosis with eyelid swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a diffuse mass involving the inferior, lateral, and superior right orbit and both maxillary sinuses. Incisional biopsy of the orbital mass was performed. RESULTS: Histopathology disclosed diffuse infiltration of the orbital tissues by a high-grade lymphoid neoplasm that showed positive immunoreactivity for B-cell markers. Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies disclosed a characteristic t(8;14) translocation consistent with a small, noncleaved malignant lymphoma of the Burkitt type. CONCLUSION: Non-African Burkitt lymphoma may manifest with orbital involvement.
