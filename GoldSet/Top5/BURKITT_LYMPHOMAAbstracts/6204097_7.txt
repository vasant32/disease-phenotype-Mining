The expression of vimentin, the major polypeptide of the intermediate filament (IFM) cytoskeleton of lymphoid cells, was studied in normal and malignant human lymphoid cell lines. Cells from 24 of 27 Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (BLCL) were found to have an absent (16 lines) or decreased (8 lines) expression of vimentin IFM. In contrast, non-Burkitt's malignant lymphoid cell lines (5 lines) and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) derived from normal B-cells (45 lines) exhibited a well-developed vimentin IFM network. However, low expression of vimentin was also found in 3 LCL derived from patients with the Langer-Giedion syndrome, which is characterized by a deletion of the distal end of chromosome 8. Treatment of vimentin-negative BLCL and Langer-Giedion LCL with azacytidine led to a transient reexpression of vimentin.
