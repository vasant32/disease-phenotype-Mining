The kinetics of ATP release from Burkitt lymphoma target cells following complement activation by rat monoclonal IgM antibody have been used to develop a standard assay for antibody-complement mediated cytotoxicity. This assay permitted the study of the reactivity of the monoclonal IgM with Burkitt and non-Burkitt cell lines and to perform IgM-complement mediated cytotoxicity inhibition experiments with oligosaccharides. This led to a precise definition of the antigenic determinant recognized by the monoclonal IgM on globotriaosylceramide.
