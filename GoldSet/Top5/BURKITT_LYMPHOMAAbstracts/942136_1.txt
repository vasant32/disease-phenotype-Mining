A case of sporadic Burkitt lymphoma, localized in the face, in a four year old male, is presented. The marked involvement of the hemolymphatic system and the prognostic value of the metastatic cellular type that may be found in bone marrow is pointed out. Due to the lack of other concluding etiopathogenic criteria, the diagnosis can be established in view of the pathologic and histochemical characteristics of the tumor.
