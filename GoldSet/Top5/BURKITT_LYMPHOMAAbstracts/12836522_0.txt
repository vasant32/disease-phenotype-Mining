Burkitt Lymphoma is the most frequent lymphoma of childhood in West Africa. The main localisations are facial and abdominal. In this study, the authors describe the case of a sub-cutaneous localisation of a Burkitt to a seven years old boy. He was admitted at the hospital because of an abdominal tumefaction. Nowadays such a case has seldom been published. After using cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and aracytine, all the tumefactions disappeared. This case was interesting because of the exceptional localisation of the lymphoma, which may induce a wrong diagnosis.
