We report the case of a 38-year-old man, previously treated for Hodgkin's disease (HD) with chemo-radiotherapy who, 10 years later, developed a Burkitt lymphoma (BL) as a tumour mass of the ascendent colon and regional lymph nodes and, subsequently, on leukaemic bone-marrow cells, on the basis of histological, immunological (B phenotype, IgM-lambda) and cytogenetic, translocation t(8;14) features. The patient died a few days later; at autopsy no evidence of HD was found. This is the 2nd case of BL developing after HD so far described. The relationship between the 2 diseases is discussed and the importance of the immunodepression in the pathogenesis of the secondary Burkitt lymphoma is emphasized.
