Immature B-cells, including B-cell lymphoma lines, are often deficient in ecto-5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) activity. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) was shown to be capable of inducing maturation toward plasmacytoid-like cells in immunoglobulin (Ig)-secreting B-cell lines. An attempt was made to induce the enzyme in 5'-NT-negative B-cell lymphoma lines with TPA to clarify the relationship between 5'-NT and B-cell differentiation. After 3 days in the presence or absence of TPA, these cell lines were examined morphologically, and their 5'-NT activity, Ig secretion, surface Ig, and Ia, B1, and B2 antigens were estimated. Neither Ig secretion nor 5'-NT activity was induced by TPA in any of 4 nonsecreting cell lines studied. Ig secretion was significantly increased in 4 of 5 lg-secreting cell lines. Two of these inducible cell lines, JD 38 and ST 486, became positive for 5'-NT activity and acquired morphologic characteristics of plasma cells after culture with TPA. The lymphoma cell line JD 38 was transplanted into nude mice and gave rise to a solid tumor. Although the tumor cells remained negative for 5'-NT, they could be induced by TPA to express both the enzyme activity and plasmacytoid-like appearance. These data suggested that in the Ig-secreting B-cell lymphoma lines, there was an association between the inducibility of 5'-NT and the capacity of these cell lines to undergo plasma-cytoid-like transformation in response to TPA.
