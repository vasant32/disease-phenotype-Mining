In France, more than 80% of children with Burkitt's lymphoma or Burkitt's leukemia (ALL3) are now cured with the LMB (B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and B-ALL) protocols of the Société Française d'Oncologie Pédiatrique, but so far, poor results have been obtained in the few adult studies available. We have analyzed the experience with LMB protocols in adult patients. This retrospective study involved 65 adult patients with small noncleaved cell lymphoma or ALL3 treated with the LMB protocols. They were 17 to 65 years old and not previously treated. Human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients were excluded. The diagnoses were made between September 1984 and August 1991. According to the Murphy classification, 12 patients (18%) had stage I or II disease, 25 (38%), stage III disease; 4 (6%), stage IV disease; and 24 (37%), ALL3 (> or = 25% blasts). According to the Ann Arbor classification, 9 patients had stage I disease; 8 patients, stage II; 5 patients, stage III; 21 patients, stage IV disease; and 22 patients, ALL (> or = 30% blasts). Twelve patients had central nervous system (CNS) involvement before treatment. Thirty-nine patients were treated according to the LMB 84 protocol scheme; 14 according to the LMB 86 protocol, and 12 patients received the LMB 84 induction courses followed by the LMB 86 consolidation courses. Three patients underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) while in second complete remission (CR) and 3 others had refractory disease. There were some protocol violations caused by empirical medical decisions: local irradiation was performed in 4 patients, 2 patients received prophylactic radiation to the brain that was not specified in the protocol, 13 patients underwent BMT in first CR, and methotrexate doses were modified in 10 patients. Fifty-eight patients (89%) achieved a CR. There were four (6%) primary induction treatment failures, and three (4%) early treatment-related deaths. Eight patients relapsed between 2 and 30 months after CR (median, 4.7 months). Forty-seven patients are alive in CR (45 first CR, 2 second CR) with a median follow-up of 57 months (24 to 93 months). There were five toxicity-related deaths among patients in CR including four BMT-related deaths and five deaths caused by refractory relapses. One patient died in CR at 62 months of rectal cancer. The 3-year overall survival rate is 74% (SE = 5). According to the stages in the Murphy classification, the 3-year survival rates are stages I and II, 100%; stage III, 80% (SE = 7); and stage IV and ALL, 57% (SE = 8). Seven of 12 patients with initial CNS disease are alive with a median survival of 56 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
