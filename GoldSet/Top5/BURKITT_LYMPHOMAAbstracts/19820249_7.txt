 BACKGROUND: Cancer is a well-recognized complication of organ transplantation. The pattern of malignancies that occur in the paediatric graft population is different from that in the general paediatric population and in the population of adult organ transplant recipients. METHODS: We reviewed medical records from 240 consecutive paediatric renal transplantations performed in 219 children, aged less than 19 years, in our centre between April 1987 and March 2007. Data from patients who had been transferred into adult units were extracted from the French registries of dialysis and transplantation. RESULTS: Among the 219 children who underwent renal transplantation during the study period, 16 (7.3%) developed malignancy. The cumulative incidence of cancer was 1.9, 4.0, 6.9 and 10.2% at 1, 5, 10 and 15 years post-transplantation, respectively. The 10-year incidence of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) was 4.5%. Other identified cancers were Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphomas, renal papillary carcinoma, thyroid papillary carcinoma, recurrent ovarian seminoma and skin cancer. The mortality rate was 25% (4/16). CONCLUSION: Early detection of cancer in transplant recipients is of great importance. Regular screening for persistent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA viral load in patients at risk for developing PTLD is recommended. The occurrence of skin cancer in transplanted children is extremely rare during childhood, but cases can develop in early adulthood.
