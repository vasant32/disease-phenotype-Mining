Human FACS-sorted B lymphocyte subpopulations were investigated for their susceptibility to immortalization by Epstein Barr virus (EBV). Only B cells reacting with the monoclonal antibody B2 were immortalized, whereas cells reacting with anti-human IgG or the monoclonal antibody BB2 were not responding. Cells positive or negative for IgM, IgD, Burkitt's lymphoma antigen (BLA), BB1, and HB2 were all transformed by EBV.
