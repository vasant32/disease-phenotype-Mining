Three patients with HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma were treated with human recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). They had all developed leucopenia during treatment with recombinant interferon-alpha-2a, in two cases combined with vincristine. In all three patients, there was an obvious rapid stimulation after s.c. injection of 300 or 150 micrograms G-CSF per day; the white blood count reached normal values within only a few days and partial transformation to leucocytosis took place. After discontinuation of G-CSF, leucocyte counts regressed rapidly to pretreatment levels. A dose of 150 micrograms of G-CSF twice to three times per week proved to be sufficient to keep the white blood cell count in the normal range allowing the treatment necessary for Kaposi sarcoma. G-CSF therapy had no serious side effects. One of the patients developed a tumour-like infiltration in his left upper jaw, which histologically simulated Burkitt's lymphoma and which regressed spontaneously after discontinuation of the G-CSF therapy. G-CSF plays an important role in the treatment of patients with HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma and enables combined treatment with zidovudine, interferon, and cytostatic drugs.
