In situ chromosomal hybridization of a probe for part of the lambda light chain constant region (C lambda) has demonstrated that the 22q11 breakpoints of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) t(9;22) and Burkitt lymphoma t(8;22) are not identical. For CML, the breakpoint is distal to the IGLC genes, whereas for Burkitt lymphoma it is proximal. The study provides direct evidence for regional assignment of the IGLC gene cluster to 22q11.
