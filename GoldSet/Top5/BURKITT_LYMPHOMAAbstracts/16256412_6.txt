A review of oral malignant neoplasms biopsies accessioned in the pathology services of Harare Central Hospital and Parirenyatwa Hospital, Harare, Zimbabwe, during the 10year period January 1982 to December 1991 was carried out. Clinical records of 428 patients with histologically diagnosed oral malignant neoplasms by ICD-O type and site (COO.O-CO6.9) were retrieved and analyzed for gender, age, history of tobacco and alcohol usage, neoplastic type and histologic differentiation of squamous cell carcinoma (8000/3). Oral malignant neoplasms constituted 24.8% (n = 428) of the 1723 biopsies accessioned in the department during this period. There was a male to female ratio of 1.9:1, with lesions being most common in the 41-60 year age group. Squamous cell carcinoma, (8070/3) 73.1%, was the predominant oral malignancy most common in the 61-70 year age group with 21.1% on the mandibular gingivae (CO3.1), 20.5% on the tongue (CO1.9-CO2.9), 18.5% on the floor of the mouth (CO4.9) and 10.5% each on the maxillary gingivae (CO3.O) and buccal mucosa (CO6.O). The hard palate (CO5.9) had 9% of the lesions. Lip malignancy (COO-COO.9 and C44.0), inclusive of mucosa of lip, vermilion and skin, constituted 3.3% and minor salivary gland (CO6.9) malignancy (M-8940/3) 4.9%. The remaining oral malignancies, 11%, included Burkitt's lymphoma (M-9687/3) 4.7%; Kaposi's sarcoma (M-9140/3) 3.7%; osteosarcoma (M-9180/3) 2.6% and malignant melanoma (M-8720/3) 1.9%. Fourty five percent of the patients admitted tobacco and alcohol consumption, of whom 95% were males. Oral malignant neoplasms were more common in males than females and occurred in a relatively young age group. Well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (M-8070/31) was the most common oral malignant neoplasm and was most frequently found on the mandibular gingivae (CO3.1), tongue (CO1.9-CO2.9) and floor of the mouth (CO4.9). The lip (COO-COO.9) was least affected with a high palatal (CO5.9) involvement.
