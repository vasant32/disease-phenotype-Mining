BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess clinicopathological characteristics and outcome in a series of primary ocular adnexal lymphomas (POALs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with localised (stage IE) POAL were followed for a median of 96 months (24-156). The diagnosis was based on surgical biopsies followed by immunohistochemistry in 16 cases or fine-needle aspiration followed by immunocytophenotypic analysis in three cases. Twelve patients were treated with local radiotherapy (RT), five with chemotherapy (CT), and two refused further therapy after apparently radical tumour removal achieved by the diagnostic excisional biopsy. RESULTS: The histological and immunological pattern was consistent with a diagnosis of MALT-type lymphoma (11 cases), follicular center non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (three cases). a large-cell variant of Burkitt's lymphoma (one case), and large-cell transformed MALT lymphoma (one case). Low-grade lymphoma was diagnosed in the three cases which underwent fine-needle aspiration biopsy. All of the patients achieved and maintained complete remission except for those treated with surgical excision alone (two MALT conjunctival lymphoma cases): one of these relapsed locally, the other experienced the systemic spread of a transformed diffuse large-cell lymphoma and died 72 months after diagnosis. The side effects consisted of two cases of RT-related cataract after 52 and 72 months. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of histology, prognosis was excellent when surgery plus RT was adopted, and CT seems to be a valid alternative to RT. Surgery alone may be sub-optimal.
