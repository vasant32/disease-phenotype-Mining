The interaction of poly- and monoclonal antibodies against the L-chain of human Ig with Burkitt lymphoma EB-3 cells was studied using a fluorescent lipid probe, anthrylvinyl-labelled sphingomyelin, incorporated into the cell plasma membrane. Binding of the antibodies to Ig receptors on the surface was shown to induce changes in the fluorescence polarization of the probe. The high sensitivity of the method allows one to detect less than 100 antibody molecules per cell. The possibility of using cells or liposomes carrying antigens and fluorescent lipids for the determination of antibodies in solution is discussed.
