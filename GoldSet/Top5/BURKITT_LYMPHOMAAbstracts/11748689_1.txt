Human leukemic cell lines, Jurkat (T-cell leukemia), Daudi (Burkitt's lymphoma, B-cell leukemia) and THP-1 (acute monocytic leukemia) synthesize chondroitin sulphate (CS) and heparan sulphate (HS) in both cell membrane and culture medium. CS is the major secreted GAG in all cell lines, as well as the major cell-retarded glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in Jurkat and Daudi, whereas HS is the major GAG in the cell membrane of THP-1. The effects of mitogenic substances on both synthesis and distribution of GAGs in Jurkat, Daudi and THP-1, independently of their effect on cell proliferation, were studied. The secretion of CS and HS from Jurkat was significantly suppressed by using 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3). These mitogens had different effect on the synthesis of cell-associated GAG by Jurkat, depending on the mitogen type. Addition of TPA or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Daudi's culture medium resulted in increased synthesis of HS, while no effect on CS synthesis was noticed. Furthermore, in the presence of LPS, THP-1 produce slightly lower amounts of CS, whereas this mitogen significantly suppresses the HS synthesis in both culture medium and cell membrane. The obtained data clearly demonstrate that the various mitogenic substances participate in the regulation of GAG synthesis. The effects are dependent on the type of mitogen and the cell line.
