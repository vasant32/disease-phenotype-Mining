Immunophenotypic analysis can identify protein epitopes in non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) that may respond to targeted immunotherapies, such as anti-CD20 and anti-CD52. Recent studies suggest additional targets may provide therapeutic benefits in NHL. This study evaluated protein expression of CD25, CD52, CD74 and CD80 in paediatric NHL to determine possible targets for immune-based therapeutic approaches. Patient samples were derived from paediatric NHL clinical trials sponsored by the Children's Cancer Group (CCG, now the Children's Oncology Group, COG) and included Burkitt lymphoma (BL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), disseminated T- and B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL and B-LBL) and anaplastic large cell (ALCL). Immunophenotypic studies were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded diagnostic tissues. CD25 was expressed in 8% of T-LBL and 75% of ALCL cases, but not in BL, DLBCL, or B-LBL. CD52 was expressed in 99% of cases of paediatric NHL of all subtypes. CD74 was expressed in 100% of B-LBL, BL and DLBCL, but was absent in ALCL and T-LBL. CD80 was expressed in 12% of B-LBL, 6% of BL and 10% of DLBCL cases studied, but was not detected in T-cell NHL. These expression patterns suggest that CD25, CD52 and CD74 may represent potential new therapeutic targets in paediatric NHL.
