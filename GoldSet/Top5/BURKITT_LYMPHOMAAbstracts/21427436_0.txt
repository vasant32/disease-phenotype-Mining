An isolated facial nerve palsy is rare as the presentation of a central nervous system lymphoma. In this case series, we present the clinical features of three HIV-positive patients presenting with facial nerve palsies due to HIV-associated Burkitt's lymphoma. These patients had a non-resolving facial paralysis, which occurred during a late stage of HIV. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not show leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid revealed a lymphocytosis with elevated protein and low glucose levels. The diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma was made on histology which showed the characteristic 'starry sky' appearance due to scattered tangible body-laden macrophages. The patients were commenced on the intensive chemotherapy regimen of CODOX-M/IVAC. Two patients died of disease progression and the third patient died of chemotherapy toxicity. This case series highlights the need for a high index of suspicion for underlying malignancy when a patient presents with a persistent facial paralysis in the later stages of HIV infection.
