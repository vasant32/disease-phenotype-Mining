A panel of 12 Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and four other B cell lines were tested for the presence of mutations in p53. Protein analysis using a mutant-specific antibody and sequencing of both cDNA and genomic DNA revealed changes relative to the standard p53 protein sequence in 12 of the 16 lines studied, including 10 of the BL lines. Mutation of p53 in the BL lines was usually accompanied by loss of the other allele of p53. Testing of the mutated p53 cDNAs for gain of transforming activity or loss of growth suppression activity showed that several of the BL mutants were functionally altered from wild-type p53.
