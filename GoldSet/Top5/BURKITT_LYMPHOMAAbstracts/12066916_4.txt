Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma is rare and is most often seen in immunodeficient patients. The majority of these tumors are the non-Hodgkin type and are high grade. Primary Burkitt lymphoma of the CNS in immunocompetent individuals has rarely been reported. The authors treated a 49-year-old woman who presented with left-sided weakness that had lasted 1.5 months. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an oval mass in the left parietal region. with central necrosis and peripheral edema, and no attachment to the leptomeninges or ependyma. Pathological examination yielded a diagnosis of typical Burkitt lymphoma. Six months postoperatively, the patient is ambulatory and has improving neurological signs. This is a typical case of primary Burkitt lymphoma of the brain in an immunocompetent patient, which is a very rare event. The imaging pattern of the lesion is not typical of brain lymphomas and can result in an incorrect preoperative diagnosis of other brain tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme. The patient's treatment and follow-up review are discussed.
