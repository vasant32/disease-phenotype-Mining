Twenty American patients with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) were studied serologically and biochemically to detect an association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A wide range of antibody reactivities was encountered. Five patients had serological profiles similar to those of African patients with BL: one and possibly two of these patients harbored EBV-DNA in their tumors. Fifteen patients had low or absent antibody to EBV: tumors from 10 of these patients lacked evidence of EBV-DNA. An unexplained association between elevated antibody (greater than or equal to 1:80) to EBV virus capsid antigen (VCA) and a favorable prognosis was noted in this series; this prognostic observation requires further substantiation. Thus, it appears that EBV-associated BL is inversely proportional to tumor endemicity. An etiological role for EBV in BL remains speculative.
