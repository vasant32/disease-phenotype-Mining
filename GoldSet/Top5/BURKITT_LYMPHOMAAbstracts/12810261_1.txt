The translocation between chromosomes 2 and 8, t(2;8), is well known for its strong association with high-grade Burkitt lymphoma. However, the significance of this translocation in indolent lymphoproliferative disorders is not clear. We present the case of a 75-year-old white male with left upper quadrant abdominal pain, splenomegaly, and an elevated white cell count of 30.3x10(9) cells/L (84% large lymphoid cells with scanty cytoplasm and prominent central nucleoli). Immunophenotyping revealed a clonal B-cell population coexpressing CD5, CD19, and CD20 with weak CD23 and CD25 and very weak, restricted, surface lambda. The cytogenetic analysis showed all 20 cells with t(2;8)(p12;q24.3). In addition, four of the 20 cells also showed a second translocation: t(12;17)(p13;q21). Molecular analysis using c-myc and p53 probes showed normal results with no indication of amplification of C-MYC or deletion of TP53. The patient was managed as an indo-lent/low-grade lymphoproliferative disorder with excellent response to eight cycles of fludarabine.
