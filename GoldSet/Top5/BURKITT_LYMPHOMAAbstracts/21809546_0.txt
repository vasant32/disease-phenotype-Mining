 OBJECTIVE: To invest the effect and mechanism of matrine on apoptosis of human Burkitt's lymphoma Raji cells. METHODS: Raji cells were cultured in vitro and treated by different final concentrations (0.4, 0.8, 1.6 mg/mL) of matrine or combined with SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) before matrine was added, then cocultured for 48 h, cell apoptosis rate was detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining method and the P-p38 MAPK, Fas, FasL protein expresssion of Raji cells were evaluated by Western blot. RESULTS: After cells were treated by matrine (0.4, 0.8, 1.6 mg/mL), the corresponding total apoptosis rate (15.77 +/- 0.53)%, (27.88 +/- 1.52)%, (48.08 +/- 2.87)%, had statistical significance compared with SB203580 groups (11. 48 +/- 0.64)%, (19.34 +/- 0.91)%, (33.98 +/- 1.26)% (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), and control group (8.78 +/- 0.66)% (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). As the concentration of matrine gradually increased,the protein expresssion levels of P-p38MAPK, Fas, FasL increased, and decreased after SB203580 were added, the correlation of P-p38MAPK and Fas, FasL was obvious. CONCLUSION: Matrine can upregulation of Fas and FasL to promote the apoptosis of Raji cells, it may be related to p38MAPK Activation.
