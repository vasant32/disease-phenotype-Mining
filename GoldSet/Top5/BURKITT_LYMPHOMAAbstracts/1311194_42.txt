We investigated the association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with African cases of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and high grade B cell non-Burkitt's lymphoma (non-BL) occurring in areas where BL is endemic. The presence of EBV genomes was analysed in 24 cases using in situ hybridization with a 35S-labelled EBV probe applied to paraffin sections. EBV DNA was detected in each of 10 cases of BL in which technically satisfactory results were obtained, the virus being homogeneously distributed in all identifiable tumour cells. Two other cases of BL could not be evaluated because of technical problems. In contrast, EBV DNA was not detected in any case of high-grade non-BL (10 centroblastic and two immunoblastic lymphomas). These results confirm previous reports of the strong association of EBV with endemic BL, but suggest that the virus is not important in the pathogenesis of other types of African high-grade B cell lymphoma from regions where BL is endemic.
