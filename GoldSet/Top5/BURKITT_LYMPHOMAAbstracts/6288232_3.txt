Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-harboring non-producer Raji cells were activated to express Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EA) by the combined use of n-butyrate and various tumor promoters such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), Euphorbiaceae plant extracts and the toxic microbial metabolite, teleocidin. With regard to the structural differences among the inducing agents (promoters), the patterns of EBV early polypeptides were strikingly similar. A common pathway is probably involved in the activation of the latent genomes of the virus in the host cells.
