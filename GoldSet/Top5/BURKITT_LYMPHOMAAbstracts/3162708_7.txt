The frequency of Burkitt lymphoma-leukemia (BL) is high in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). We describe four such cases, three with a translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32) and one with a t(8;22)(q24;q11). No Epstein-Barr virus genome was found in the tumorous cells of this patient. Including these cases, 13 patients with AIDS-associated BL have been reported so far with specific translocations. Three had a t(8q+; 22q-) variant translocation and the other ten patients had the t(8q-; 14q+). Associated chromosomal abnormalities were as frequent as in ordinary BL and were comparable with those occurring in cases of other BL, such as partial duplication of 1q and 13q34 rearrangements. Trisomy 12, however, was observed in 3 out of 13 AIDS-associated BL cases.
