Five pediatric patients are described with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who at presentation had clinical findings suggestive of B cell ALL and lymphoblasts with FAB L3 morphology and the characteristic t(8;14)(q24;q32). However, the leukemia cells of all five patients failed to express surface immunoglobulin (sIg) and kappa or lambda light chains. Based on initial immunophenotyping results consistent with B-precursor ALL, four of these cases were initially treated with conventional ALL chemotherapy. These four patients were switched to B cell ALL treatment protocols once cytogenetic results became available revealing the 8;14 translocation. The fifth case was treated with B cell ALL therapy from the outset. Four of the five patients are in complete remission at 64, 36, 29 and 13 months from diagnosis. One patient relapsed and died 6 months after initial presentation. These five unusual cases with clinical B cell ALL, the t(8;14), and FAB L3 morphology, but negative sIg, demonstrate the importance of careful and multidisciplinary evaluation of leukemic cells with morphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping and cytogenetic analysis. Future identification of patients with this profile will allow us to expand our knowledge regarding prognostic significance and optimal treatment for this rare subgroup of patients.
