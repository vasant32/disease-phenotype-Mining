Discovered in 1964 by Epstein and Barr, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is widespread in all areas of the world, infecting over 95% of the adult population and earning it the informal name, 'Every Body's Virus'. It was shown to be the causal agent of infectious mononucleosis (IM) in 1968, and many reports followed linking EBV to several other clinical syndromes. In 1970, the virus was shown to be able to immortalize B lymphocytes, which are one of its target cells. This oncogenic potential underlies the role of EBV in Burkitt's lymphoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders and lymphoma in HIV-infected patients. In addition, EBV can infect epithelial cells in the nasopharynx and is a co-factor for development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. There is no treatment available for IM to date; however, virus-associated complications may be treated with various modes of immune modulation. Currently, radiotherapy and chemotherapy remain the main treatments for EBV-associated malignancies. Recent evidence has suggested that adoptive therapy through infusions of human leukocyte-associated antigen-matched EBV cytotoxic T cells may form a novel strategy for both prophylaxis and treatment of EBV-induced lymphoproliferative disorders. Additionally, a vaccine based on immunization with a structural antigen, gp350, is under evaluation.
