The nucleotide sequence of a human Blym-1 transforming gene activated in a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line was determined. This sequence predicts a small protein of 58 amino acids that is 33 percent identical to the predicted product of chicken Blym-1, the activated transforming gene of chicken B cell lymphomas. Both the human and chicken Blym-1 genes exhibit significant identity to an amino-terminal region of transferrins.
