The incidence of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) during pregnancy is rare. We report a case of nasal BL with symptoms mimicking chronic rhinosinusitis and extensive unilateral polyposis in a pregnant woman. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery was performed. Histopathologic examination suggested a BL, and chemotherapy was initiated. She was not given radiotherapy. She has kept free of disease for 9 months since the completion of treatment. When a physician is confronted with unusual localization among the polypoid tissue described here, a complete differential diagnosis must be done.
