CT examinations were performed in 12 cases with histological proved Burkitt lymphoma. 10 cases showed an abdominal manifestation, 1 patient has had mediastinal and neck lymph node enlargements, and in 1 case an involvement of the maxilla was seen. CT revealed the precise localisation, size and extension of the disease. Particularly CT has been very useful for the posttherapeutic assessment, for measuring the tumor response and for detection of a tumor relapse.
