We tested blood samples of 25 pediatric renal transplant recipients for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA load by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Eleven of these transplant recipients showed clinical persistent mononucleosis-like symptoms years after transplantation (Tx). A quantitation of EBV DNA by PCR in peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) and serum samples revealed variable EBV DNA titers. The majority of EBV PCR results in samples of the 14 asymptomatic transplant recipients was repeatedly below detection limit. In contrast, patients with mononucleosis-like symptoms showed persistent EBV genome titers over a period of 6 months, ranging from 75 to 18 750 copies/10 000 PBL and from 680 to 335 000 copies/mL serum, respectively. One child suffering from this mononucleosis-like condition developed an EBV-associated Burkitt-like lymphoma 29 months after Tx. Whereas clinical and histological investigations did not indicate a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) until tumor detection, EBV titers in PBL and serum had been high for at least 8 months. We propose that pediatric transplant recipients who show both, recurrent mononucleosis-like symptoms and a sustained high EBV genome load, are at increased risk for severe EBV-related post-transplant complications.
