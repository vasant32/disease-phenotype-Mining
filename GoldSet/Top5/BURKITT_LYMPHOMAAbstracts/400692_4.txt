High dose combination chemotherapy was given to 22 patients with malignant lymphoma resistant to conventional chemotherapy. This was followed in 12 patients by an infusion of their cryopreserved autologous bone marrow; 10 patients received chemotherapy alone and serve as controls. Patients receiving marrow recovered leukocyte, granulocyte, and platelet function significantly faster than controls demonstrating that cryopreserved autologous bone marrow infusions accelerate hemopoietic recovery. Four patients with Burkitt's lymphoma resistant to conventional chemotherapy appear cured of their disease following this single treatment with higher doses of chemotherapy.
