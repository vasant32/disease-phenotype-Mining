While both primary and chronic herpes simplex virus (HSV) in vitro infections of a Burkitt's lymphoma-derived cell line (Raji) were similarly characterized by the induction of IgG-Fe receptors in about 50% of cells, the persistent HSV infection of Raji cells was also accompanied by an induction of surface-bound IgM in approximately 80% of cells. This IgM induction was suppressed by treating the infected cells with interferon, but not with phosphonoacetic acid, an inhibitor of herpes virus DNA polymerase activity. The fact that only the cell population which had lost this IgM expression was superinfectable would suggest that this Ig may play a protective role (e.g. antibody activity?) against HSV.
