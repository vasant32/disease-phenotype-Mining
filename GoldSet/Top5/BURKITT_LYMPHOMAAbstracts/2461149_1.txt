The features of neuroblastoma and outcome of its management in 15 Nigerian children seen in the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Zaria over a 7-year period are described. The majority were between the ages of 3 and 5 years and the male:female ratio was 2.75:1. Over half of the patients presented with abdominal masses, about half with proptosis and a third with skull nodules. The diagnosis of neuroblastoma was correctly made on admission in only five instances. The mainstay of treatment was chemotherapy and the outcome was uniformly poor. Only one patient attended follow-up for as long as 1 year. Based on the present study, the frequency of neuroblastoma ranks third, after Burkitt's lymphoma and Wilms' tumour, amongst malignant childhood solid tumours encountered in the paediatric unit of Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital. The low index of suspicion and poor diagnostic facilities might, however, have contributed to the low reported incidence, late diagnosis and poor survival rates of children with this tumour.
