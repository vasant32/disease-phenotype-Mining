By analysis with a panel of CD21 MoAbs it is shown that a large part of the soluble CD21 in human blood plasma is of the long isoform (CD21L), as judged by comparison with antigen produced by mouse L cells transfected with CD21L-cDNA and reactivity with the restricted CD21 MoAb R4/23. This is compatible with the hypothesis that soluble CD21 in the blood is mainly derived from follicular dendritic cells (FDC). Cells from a human keratinocyte cell line transfected with cDNA from the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Raji also produced soluble CD21L (sCD21L), whereas the short form of sCD21 (sCD21S) was the major component of sCD21 produced by the B lymphoblastoid cell line LICR-LON-HMy and the T cell line Jurkat. Confocal studies of FDC isolated from human tonsil revealed that CD21 was present in the cytoplasm. On gel filtration sCD21 from untreated serum has an apparent size considerably greater than the 130kD found by SDS-PAGE analysis. This may be partly accounted for by the non-globular shape of the molecule, but may also indicate, as reported by others, that in its native state sCD21 is complexed with other proteins. However, no evidence of complexing with sCD23 or C3d could be found.
