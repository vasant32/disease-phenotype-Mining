Administration of doxorubicin (DXR) formulated in sterically stabilized liposomes, (SL) containing engrafted poly(ethylene glycol)-modified phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE) on their surface, has been shown to increase the therapeutic index of the drug. A further improvement could be achieved through targeting of liposome-entrapped drug selectively to cancer cells. This paper describes the conjugation of the anti-B-cell lymphoma monoclonal antibody LL2 to the surface of DXR-loaded liposomes by use of a PEG-based heterobifunctional coupling agent. Competitive-binding ELISA of the resulting immunoliposomes (SIL) against the monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody, WN, indicated preserved immunological activity. The pH-sensitive probe, HPTS was used to study the binding of liposomes with target cells. The results showed a 3.8-fold increased cellular association of SIL compared to that of SL and an apparent internalization of SIL into low pH compartments. Addition of an excess of unconjugated free LL2 displaced about 72% of the HPTS-SIL association with cells. Experiments with 125I-labeled free and SIL-bound LL2 showed approximately 50% degradation for both preparations. In vitro MTT cytotoxicity tests against neoplastic B cells gave IC(50) values of 1.6, 2.9 and 0.35 microM for DXR-SIL, DXR-SL and free DXR, respectively. Leakage of drug from the liposomes apparently reduced the specificity of the cytotoxic action of DXR-SIL.
