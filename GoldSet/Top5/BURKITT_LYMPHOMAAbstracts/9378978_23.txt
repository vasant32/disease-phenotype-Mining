Coordinate regulation of MHC class II genes occurs in a tissue-specific and cytokine-inducible manner. While the upstream regulatory sequences are conserved among all MHC class II genes, multiple base pair changes are found, even within the essential X box region. Analysis of all class II X boxes reveals differential binding between two transcription factors known to interact with the X box region, regulatory factor X and X2 box-binding protein (RFX and X2BP) of the HLA-DRA gene. These data presented a paradox with regard to the coordinate regulation of the class II genes if the factors though to regulate the HLA-DRA gene do not bind to the homologous sequence of all class II genes. Previous results suggested that cooperative interactions between the DNA binding proteins may be the key to understanding this paradox. Here RFX/X2BP/DNA complexes were formed on all class II isotypes regardless of the ability of the X box region to bind either factor individually. To further determine the role of the interactions between the X and Y factors, multiprotein/DNA complexes containing RFX, X2BP, NF-Y, and X-Y box DNA of the DRA and DRB genes were formed. This quaternary complex was extremely stable to competitor DNA, with a half-life > 4 h. These results suggest that the conserved X and Y boxes of class II genes function similarly and define a single multiprotein regulatory complex for class II expression in B cells.
