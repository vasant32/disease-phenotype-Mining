BACKGROUND: The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has allowed the exploration of more dose-intensive therapy such as autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in selected patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). METHODS: The authors report on the use of myeloablative chemotherapy with ASCT in two HIV positive patients with NHL. The first patient underwent ASCT at the time of first disease remission for poor risk, diffuse, large cell NHL and the second patient had multiply recurrent, chemosensitive Burkitt lymphoma. ASCT was performed in both patients using a transplant conditioning regimen of high dose cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and etoposide (CBV). RESULTS: The target dose of >/= 5 x 10(6)/kg CD34 positive peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) utilized for ASCT was collected using granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) after chemotherapy for mobilization while both patients were receiving concomitant HAART for HIV infection. HAART was continued during CBV conditioning. Prompt hematopoietic recovery was observed after ASCT. Both patients remained in clinical disease remission from their lymphoma at 28 months and 20 months after transplant, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ASCT is feasible in patients with HIV-associated NHL. Adequate numbers of CD34 positive PBSC can be procured from patients receiving HAART and chemotherapy for NHL. Selected patients with HIV-related lymphoma can tolerate the high dose CBV myeloablative chemotherapy regimen without increased acute regimen-related toxicity. Reinfusion of G-CSF-mobilized PBSC can lead to rapid recovery of hematologic function and sustained engraftment after ASCT. Given the poor prognosis of patients with HIV-associated NHL treated with conventional chemotherapy, further investigation of this approach should be considered.
