Sera from 34 children with recurrent parotitis were measured by indirect immunofluorescence technique for antibody levels to several Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens. IgG antibodies to EBV-capsid antigen (VCA) and EBV-associated nuclear antigen, often at high titres, were found in 29 of these patients, of whom 20 also had IgA antibody to VCA. Antibody level to early antigen complex (R and D) rose in 19 patients, of whom 18 had antibody to the R component alone. The abnormal patterns of EBV antibodies persisted for 3-14 months during and after the illness in 8 patients. These observations suggest that EBV infection may be important in the pathogenesis of recurrent parotitis.
