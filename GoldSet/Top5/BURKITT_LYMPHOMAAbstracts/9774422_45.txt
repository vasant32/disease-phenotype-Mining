Apoptosis or programmed cell death is essential in the process of controlling lymphocyte growth and selection. We identified proteins that are involved in anti-IgM antibody-mediated apoptosis using a subclone of the human Burkitt lymphoma cell line BL60. Apoptosis-associated proteins were detected by high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis on a micropreparative scale. Comparison of the high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis protein patterns from apoptotic and non-apoptotic cells showed differences in approximately 80 spots including protein modifications. Analysis of the predominantly altered proteins was performed by internal Edman microsequencing and/or by peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Analysis was significantly improved by using new micropreparative high resolution two-dimensional gels employing high protein concentrations. The following 12 apoptosis-associated proteins were identified: heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1, hnRNP C1/C2, FUSE-binding protein, dUTPase, lymphocyte-specific protein LSP1, UV excision repair protein RAD23 homologue B (HHR23B), 60 S acidic ribosomal protein P0 (L10E), heterochromatin protein 1 homologue alpha (HP1alpha), nucleolin, lamin, neutral calponin, and actin. Fragmentation of actin, hnRNP A1, hnRNP C1/C2, 60 S acidic ribosomal protein P0, lamin, and nucleolin could be inhibited by benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone, a selective irreversible inhibitor of CPP32 (caspase 3).
