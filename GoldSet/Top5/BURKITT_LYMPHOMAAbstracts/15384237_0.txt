A 6-year-old male child was consulted in our ambulatory in Goundi missionary hospital in South Chad, in September 2001. He complained of a long lasting abdominal mass and weakness. African Burkitt lymphoma with abdominal "bulky" involvement was strongly suspected. As a little amount of some antiblastic drugs were available, the patient was treated according to CEOP regime as salvage treatment. A week later no lymph nodes were detectable, spleen and liver enlargement reverted to normal dimensions and the abdominal mass disappeared almost completely. Clinical general conditions improved. He was treated with further three cycles of the same therapy with 3 weeks interval with complete clinical remission after the second dose. After the first four cycles, a consolidating treatment was performed with cyclophosphamide. The child performed other two cycles of therapy with cyclophosphamide remaining in complete remission and then escaped further follow-up visit. Nevertheless, the good response achieved after the four initial cycles suggests that the CEOP combination could be effective in this kind of tumour and well tolerated. CHOP nor CEOP regime have never been employed in the treatment of African Burkitt lymphoma. This case report suggest the possibility of good responses in more critical or "bulky" Burkitt lymphoma of this combination.
