B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has been well described in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Many of these lymphomas are of the diffuse, aggressive, subtype B-cell NHL, including Burkitt and Burkitt-like lymphoma. Recently, there have been reports of B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), Burkitt type, in patients who were either HIV antibody-positive or at high risk for AIDS. We have seen three cases of B-cell ALL, Burkitt type, and herein describe their clinical and laboratory characteristics. All patients were HIV antibody-positive. Since stage IV Burkitt lymphoma in blood phase and B-cell ALL, Burkitt type, represent a continuum of the same disease, and since it is also an aggressive B-cell malignancy, we suggest that B-cell ALL, Burkitt type, in HIV antibody-positive patients should support the diagnosis of AIDS.
