FNA biopsies were performed on 24 patients with bone lesions. Cytology diagnosed ten of the cases as classic Burkitt's lymphomas. The cytodiagnoses in the remaining 14 cases were primary bone tumors (5 cases), bone cysts (2 cases), inflammatory lesions (4 cases) and inadequate material (3 cases). Smears of the Burkitt's lymphomas of the jaw contained starry sky macrophages and neoplastic lymphoid cells with deep basophilic cytoplasms and fine vacuolizations. Taking into consideration the load of Burkitt's lymphoma cases in Africa, FNA cytology appears to be a very simple method for getting a quick tissue diagnosis (results were available within 24 hours). For doctors working in tropical hospitals with limited facilities, FNA cytopathology is very useful for distinguishing between tumors and inflammations and for differentiating between benign and malignant tumors.
