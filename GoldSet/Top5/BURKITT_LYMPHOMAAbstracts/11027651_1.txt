Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, BL2 was stimulated by surface BCR cross-linking and altered gene expression was analyzed by RDA methodology. Consistent with previous reports, we detected up-regulated MDC, IL6R and adhesion molecule LFA1. We also detected gene expression of SIRPalpha, anti-apoptotic A-20, signal regulatory SLP76 and BCAR3, DNA binding proteins EGR2 and DEC1 in addition to some new genes.
