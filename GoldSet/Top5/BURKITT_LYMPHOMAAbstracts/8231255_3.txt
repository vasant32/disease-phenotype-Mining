The geographical co-ordinates of 146 cases of Burkitt's lymphoma in Malawi, with date of onset between July 1987 and October 1989, were recorded. Case clusters, pairs of cases, closer together in time and space than would be expected by chance, were discovered, using Knox's method, for children over the age of 8 years, but not for all ages.
