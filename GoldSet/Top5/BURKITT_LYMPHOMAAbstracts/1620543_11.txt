In the Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell line BL67 the first exon of the c-myc gene is fused to the mu-switch region of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (IgH). BL67 cells express IgH/c-myc hybrid RNAs which are initiated in the immunoglobulin locus, transcribed across the chromosomal breakpoint into the first exon of c-myc and spliced using the physiological splice donor and acceptor sites of the c-myc gene. We have isolated cDNAs of these hybrid RNAs and characterized the start points in the Ig heavy-chain gene. Two promoters were identified in the mu-switch region of BL67 cells which give rise to antisense transcription of the mu-gene. These promoters are also active in other BL cell lines, in B cells without Ig translocation and in a T-cell line. Both promoters co-localize with DNAase I-hypersensitive sites, HNF and HSW, in the mu-switch region. The structures of IgH/c-myc hybrid RNAs and of the corresponding promoters are described.
