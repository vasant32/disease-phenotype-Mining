Constitutive expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene in growth factor-deprived fibroblasts promotes proliferation and induces apoptosis. In these cells, apoptosis can be inhibited by survival factors such as insulin-like growth factor I or the bcl-2 proto-oncogene product. Deregulated c-Myc expression is a common feature in Epstein-Barr virus-positive Burkitt's lymphoma in which the c-myc gene is reciprocally translocated and placed under the control of one of the immunoglobulin loci. BHRF1 is an Epstein-Barr virus protein expressed early in the lytic cycle. BHRF1 is a member of the Bcl-2 family and has been shown to suppress apoptosis and to increase cell survival in different settings. In the present study, we report that BHRF1 inhibits c-Myc-induced apoptosis which occurs in the absence of survival factors. It does not, however, affect the capacity of c-Myc to promote cell growth. These findings demonstrate that BHRF1 has not only structural but also functional similarities to Bcl-2.
