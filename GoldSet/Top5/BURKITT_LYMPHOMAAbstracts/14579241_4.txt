While intensive chemotherapy is recommended for the treatment of non-HIV related adult small non-cleaved lymphoma (SNCL), including Burkitt's and Burkitt-like lymphoma, optimal treatment for patients with HIV-associated SNCL is not known. We assessed remissions and survival in a cohort of 44 consecutive HIV positive patients diagnosed with SNCL at our hospital between June 2000 and November 2001 using chart and pathology data. Median follow-up, survival and survival at the median follow-up time were 4.5 months, 4 months and 49% respectively. Of this cohort 39% were complete responders (CR) and 36% were long-term lymphoma-free survivors. Two patients relapsed from CR. Short course intensive chemotherapy (McMaster) was administered to 23 patients; 17 received less intensive conventional combination chemotherapy; and four received single-agent chemotherapy or no treatment. In the McMaster group, 38% (9/23) achieved CR with no relapses. Seven patients (30%) died of toxicity compared with one (6%) in the less intensively treated group. Of the stage I patients, 75% (6/8) achieved long-term CR with half being treated conventionally. Conventional chemotherapy may be curative for early stage HIV-SNCL. In advanced disease, McMaster chemotherapy was found to be associated with substantial early mortality but was curative in a significant number of patients.
