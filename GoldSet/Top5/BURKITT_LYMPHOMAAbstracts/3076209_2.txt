Hexamethylenbisacetamide (HMBA) can induce the Burkitt lymphoma Raji cells to enter the differentiation process as evidenced by the decrease of HLA-DR antigens. This event is preceded by a decrease of c-myc expression and of the phosphorylation of cellular proteins, due to either a decrease of tyrosine protein kinase activity or an increase of tyrosine phosphatase activity. These three events form a sequence and are part of the genetic program for differentiation and growth though they may not be causally related.
