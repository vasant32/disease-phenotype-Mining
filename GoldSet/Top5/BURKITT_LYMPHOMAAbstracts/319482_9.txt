Nine children with various hematologic disorders underwent bone-marrow transplantation following total-body irradiation with 750 rads at a rate of 26 rads/min. from a 13-MeV linear accelerator in conjunction with cytotoxic drugs. This treatment was tolerated reasonably well, with acceptable side effects. Three patients were alive and well at 18, 11, and 7 months post-transplantation at the time this paper was written.
