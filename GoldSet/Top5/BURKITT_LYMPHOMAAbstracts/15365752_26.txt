Our objective was to compare fast spin-echo (FSE) short inversion time inversion recovery (STIR) whole-body MR imaging with standard procedures in staging children with lymphoma. Eight children (age range, 2-16 years) underwent multi-station FSE STIR whole-body MR at initial staging (n=5) or for restaging following completion of therapy (n=5). Whole-body MR and conventional staging procedures, including CT (n=10), gallium-67 scintigraphy (n=9), bone scintigraphy (n=3) and bone marrow biopsy (n=7) were retrospectively compared for detection of sites involved by lymphoma and for the assigned stage. FSE STIR whole-body MR detected more sites of possible lymphomatous involvement at initial staging (87/88) and at restaging (5/5) than did conventional imaging (74/88, 3/5). MR was more sensitive than conventional imaging in detecting bone marrow involvement at initial staging. Following treatment, however, residual and therapy-induced bone marrow signal abnormalities could not be differentiated from lymphomatous involvement. Detection of nodal and visceral involvement correlated well. Our results suggest that FSE STIR whole-body MR imaging is a sensitive technique for evaluating lymphomatous involvement of bone marrow as well as non-marrow sites. Larger prospective trials are needed to determine if FSE STIR whole-body MR can replace standard radiographic procedures for initial staging and contribute in the follow-up of lymphoma in children.
