 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinicopathological features and immunophenotypes of male genitourinary system lymphoma. METHODS: We retrospectively studied the histopathological characteristics and immunohistochemical markers of 35 cases of male genitourinary system lymphoma, and reviewed the relevant literature. RESULTS: The 35 patients of male genitourinary system lymphoma were aged from 4 to 83 (mean 56.5) years, 28 (80%) of them > or = 50 years. Twenty-eight cases (80%) involved the testis, 3 (8.6%) the prostate, 1 (2.9%) the spermatic cord, 1 the seminal vesicles, 1 the penis and 1 the epididymis. Histologically, 22 cases (62.9%) were diffused large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 6 (17.1%) mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, 4 (11.4%) Burkitt lymphoma, 2 (5.7%) peripheral T cell lymphoma, and 1 (2.9%) plasmacytoma. CONCLUSION: Male genitourinary system lymphomas are rare tumors clinically, which occur more often in the elderly. The majority of them are B cell lymphomas, of which the most common is DLBCL, followed by MALT lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma. T cell lymphoma and plasmacytoma are rare. The diagnosis of male genitourinary system lymphoma relies on the histopathology, and immunohistochemical markers are of high value for its definite diagnosis, classification and differential diagnosis.
