After Epstein-Barr virus superinfection of the human lymphoblastoid cell line Raji, a Burkitt lymphoma-derived line that contains Epstein-Barr virus genomes in an episomal form, at least 40 polypeptides could be resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Eleven of the 40 polypeptides were immunoprecipitable by early antigen+/viral capsid antigen+ antiserum. The polypeptides could be divided into six classes, immediate-early, early, intermediate, late, very late, and persistent, depending upon the time of synthesis. Ten of the 40 polypeptides appeared to preexist before superinfection and persisted despite general cessation of host protein synthesis; none of the persistent proteins was immunoprecipitated by the Epstein-Barr virus antibody-containing serum. When viral DNA replication was blocked by a variety of inhibitors of DNA synthesis, a number of different patterns of polypeptide synthesis could be detected. The synthesis of six polypeptides was blocked by the most virus-specific inhibitors, acyclovir and phosphonoacetic acid. Additionally, in the presence of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, and methotrexate, seven polypeptides showed oversynthesis.
