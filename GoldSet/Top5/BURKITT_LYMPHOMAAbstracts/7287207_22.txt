The cumulative results and long-term follow-up of all patients with Burkitt's lymphoma treated at the Uganda cancer Institute Kampala are reported. The annual admission rate is 29. The tumor patients commonly present with jaw swelling (72%), abdominal swelling (56%) and central nervous system involvement (30%). Complete response rate is achieved in a high proportion of patients (81%). About 50% of these relapse, equal numbers relapsing before and after 3 months. The most important factor influencing remission duration and survival is disease stage. Other important factors are treatment protocols and, to a lesser extent, the type of relapse. Central nervous system relapse does not necessarily augur poor prognosis as second remissions and long-term survival can be achieved with appropriate therapy. Presently 25% of all treated patients have survived free of disease well beyond 5 years.
