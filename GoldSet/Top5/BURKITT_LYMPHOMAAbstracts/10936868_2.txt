A patient with a Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute mixed-lineage leukemia (AMLL) expressing both major and minor BCR/ABL mRNA transcripts is described. Phenotypic analysis of the leukemic blasts revealed positivity for both myeloid and B-cell lineages. Southern blot analysis showed a rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed the expression of both major and minor BCR/ABL mRNA transcripts. To our knowledge, this is the first report of AMLL expressing both major and minor BCR/ABL mRNA transcripts and rearrangement of the IgH gene.
