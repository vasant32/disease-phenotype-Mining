Forty cases of lymphoma were categorized as Burkitt-type lymphoma in a study of fine needle aspiration (FNA) smears. These constituted 14.3% of all cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed between 1974 and 1982. The median age was 22 years in these cases, 81.8% of which had extranodal tumors. The majority of the cells in the smears (59.8% +/- 8.32%) were in the 11 micron to 15 micron size range and 60.3% +/- 10.3% had noncleaved nuclei. An average 71% of the cells contained cytoplasmic and/or nuclear vacuolizations. Nonneoplastic macrophages were present in the smears in 87.5% of the cases. A study of paraffin-embedded sections in 17 cases revealed the characteristic "starry-sky" appearance in 11; in 5 it was not clearly appreciated and in 1 the nonneoplastic macrophages were absent. FNA cytology was found to be quite reliable for arriving at a diagnosis of Burkitt-type lymphoma. More than 50% of the cases were managed without resort to subsequent surgical biopsy. Exploratory laparotomy was avoided in 69% of the cases having abdominal tumors.
