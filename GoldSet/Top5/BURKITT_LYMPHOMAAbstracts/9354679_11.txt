Mouse plasmacytomas share pathogenetic features in common with both multiple myeloma and Burkitt's lymphoma in humans. Susceptibility to plasmacytoma induction by intraperitoneal pristane in mice is controlled by multiple genes. At least two of these genes reside on mouse chromosome 4 in regions of the genome sharing linkage homology with human chromosomes 9p21, 1p32, and 1p36. A series of congenic strains recombinant for regions of mouse chromosome 4 in the vicinity of the Pctr2 predisposition locus were created and typed for their tumor susceptibility/resistance phenotypes. These strains were derived by introgressively backcrossing alleles from resistant DBA/2 mice onto the susceptible BALB/cAnPt background. Six resistant and two susceptible strains were allelotyped for 10 genes and 49 random DNA markers to identify the smallest region of overlap in the resistant strains. These studies have determined that the Pctr2 locus resides in either a 500-kb interval proximal to Nppa, or in a 1- to 2-centiMorgan (cM) interval distal to Nppa. In these congenic strain analyses, the Nppa and Fv1 loci, in addition to genes within about 1 cM of these loci, have been excluded as candidates for the Pctr2 locus. A relevant locus that may reside in this interval is Rep2; it is associated with the efficiency of repairing X-ray induced DNA damage sustained during the G2 phase of the mitotic cycle. The Pctr2 locus acts in a codominant fashion. F1 hybrids between resistant and susceptible congenic strains exhibit a reduced tumor incidence and a significant delay in the onset of tumorigenesis. Identification and eventual cloning of the Pctr2 locus may assist in the identification of genes involved in many types of cancer showing aberrations in human chromosome 1p36.
