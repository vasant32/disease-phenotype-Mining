Several new 4-diazopyrazole derivatives were synthesized by reaction of 1-(R-substituted)phenyl-3-methyl-5-benzamidopyrazoles with a sevenfold excess of nitrous acid in acetic media. The compounds were tested at 20 microM concentration for their antineoplastic activity in vitro against Raji (human Burkitt lymphoma), K562 (human chronic myelogenous leukemia) and U937 (human histiocytic lymphoma) cell lines. They showed a percent of growth inhibition in the range 23.4-100%.
