OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between Burkitt's lymphoma and Epstein-Barr (EB) virus and its expression of p53 and bcl-2 proteins. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in situ PCR and immunohistochemical techniques were applied to specimens from 28 cases of Burkitt's lymphomas on paraffin-embedded sections. RESULTS: EB virus was found in 8 (28.5%) cases by PCR, of which 3 were positive by in situ PCR. Positive rates for the expression of p53 and bcl-2 were 44.4% and 48.1% respectively. Whereas in stages I-II and III-IV, they were 3(23.0%), 9(64.2%) and 3(23.0%), 10(71.4%) respectively. Both the expression of p53 and bcl-2 were high in stages III-IV, low in stages I-II (P < 0.05). The positive cases of EB virus in combination with the expression of p53 and bcl-2 protein, p53 protein and bcl-2 protein were 4,5,4 respectively and 9 cases were positive for p53 and bcl-2 protein. In other words, the positive cases for EB virus in combination with the expression of p53 and bcl-2 were 50%, whereas 70% were positive for both p53 and bcl-2. CONCLUSIONS: The positive rates of EB virus in our series are different from some reports of African-Burkitt's and similar to many other reports of endemic Burkitt's lymphoma. The expression of p53 and bcl-2 proteins are significantly correlated with stage; high in stages III-IV and low in stages I-II. EB virus, p53 and bcl-2 proteins may affect each other.
