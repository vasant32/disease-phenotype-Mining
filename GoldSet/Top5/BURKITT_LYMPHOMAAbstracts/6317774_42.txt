Cloned fragments of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome were used to examine tissues from 145 patients for the presence of EBV DNA by two techniques: (1) nucleic acid hybridization of cell spots from which the DNA had been extracted in situ and (2) hybridization of DNA that had been transferred to nitrocellulose by Southern blotting. EBV DNA was found in tissues from four adults and five children with American Burkitt's lymphoma, infectious mononucleosis, lymphoma following bone marrow transplant, central nervous system lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and fatal polyclonal B-cell lymphoma following mononucleosis; two patients also had chronic pneumonitis, failure to thrive, and abnormal immune function. Six of the nine patients whose tissues contained EBV DNA had a demonstrable or presumed associated immunologic disorder. EBV DNA was not found in normal tissues or in a variety of hematologic neoplasms and other disorders. Nucleic acid hybridization methods can be used for the routine examination of the association of EBV with lymphomas and other lymphoproliferative syndromes occurring in immunodeficient individuals.
