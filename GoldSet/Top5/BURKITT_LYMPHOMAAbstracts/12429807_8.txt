Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is associated with various B-cell neoplasms such as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease or Burkitt lymphoma. B-lymphocyte reprogramming by EBV involves the control of numerous cellular genes. To identify such EBV-deregulated genes, we have compared the gene expression profile of EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma cell lines (BL) (BL2, BL30, BL70) with their EBV-converted counterpart (BL2-B95, BL30-B95, BL70-B95) by cDNA array. Statistical analysis of the results was made using Ward's cluster analysis method. Results showed that the expression of up to 26% of the 1176 cellular genes analyzed may be modified in EBV-converted BL cells. Within this set of genes, a subset of genes markedly regulated in EBV-converted BL cells was defined as those for which expression in EBV+ cells was increased or decreased more than 2-fold. Expression of various genes was modulated in agreement with their previously reported regulation by EBV or by transcription factors activated by EBV. Numerous genes were newly identified as modulated in EBV-converted BL cells. Some of these results were verified by both semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting, and were consistent with functional studies. Functional classification of EBV-regulated genes gave a comprehensive picture of cellular reprogramming by EBV in BL, by pointing out cellular modules such as cell cycle, apoptosis, and signal transduction pathways, including BCR and TNF receptor family and interferon pathways. Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, cDNA array results point to three families of transcription factors, Rel/NF-kappaB, STAT1, and Ets-related proteins Spi-B, Elf-1, and Ets-1 as putative cellular targets of EBV.
