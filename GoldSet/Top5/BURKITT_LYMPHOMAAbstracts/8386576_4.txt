Two cell lines were originated from the peripheral blood (PB-LAM) and bone-marrow (BM-LAM) of a patient with Burkitt-type acute lymphoblastic leukemia and AIDS. 26 and 7 clones were isolated from PB-LAM and BM-LAM respectively by limiting dilution. All of these had surface IgM lambda and the CD10 marker with low to absent CD23, CD30, CD39 and surface adhesion molecules. Furthermore, they shared the same chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy 7 and t(8;14) translocation) and the same rearrangements of immunoglobulin L and H chain and of c-myc gene loci. These features are those most frequently found in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells and were different from those of the parental cell lines, which, besides cells identical to those of the malignant clones, also contained normal lymphoblastoid cells. Therefore, the cloning procedure used selected for the growth of cells with malignant features. EBV latent antigens were detected in all clones by Western blotting and their pattern of expression resembled that usually observed in BL cells. All the clones were positive for the EBV genome by Southern blotting and had monomorphic EBV-fused termini as determined by using cDNA probes specific for sequences at either end of the viral genome. However, the clones derived from PB-LAM had EBV fused termini of a different size from that of the clones derived from BM-LAM. The presence of different EBV-fused termini in otherwise monoclonal malignant cells indicate that EBV infection was possibly a late event in lymphomagenesis following rearrangement of the c-myc and the Ig gene loci.
