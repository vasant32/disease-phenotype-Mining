The virus in the EB-3 cell line derived from a Burkitt lymphoma was partially purified by digestion with proteolytic enzyme and by density-gradient centrifugation on potassium tartrate. Electron microscope studies of both sectioned and negatively stained samples suggest that the virus belongs to the herpes-virus group, although the exact number of capsomeres was not unequivocally established.
