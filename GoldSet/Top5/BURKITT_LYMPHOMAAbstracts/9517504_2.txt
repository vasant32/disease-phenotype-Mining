The less differentiated stage (CD10-) of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) described as preB1-ALL in the GEIL nomenclature, accounts for less than 10% of ALL. It is classically considered to be associated with translocation (4;11)(q21;q23), and to have a poor prognosis. We report an extensive immunophenotypic, genomic and clinical study of a series of 64 preB-1 ALL patients, representing 6.3% of a cohort of consecutive ALLs. The engagement of preB1-ALL cells in the B-lineage was confirmed by their B-lineage score, equal to or higher than 2. In addition, more than 90% of the cases tested showed rearranged IGH genes. Translocation (4;11) was the most frequent karyotypic anomaly seen, but only accounted for 24% of the preB1-ALL cases tested. Expression of the myeloid associated antigen CD15 was also found with high incidence in this subset. Clinical and biological features at presentation showed more significant differences between preB1- and T-ALL than between preB1- and preB2-ALL (CD10+). However, outcome characteristics of the 22 children with preB1-ALL confirmed the worse prognosis of this entity.
