 RATIONALE: Cancer disease is continuously rising worldwide as far as its incidence is concerned. Efforts were made in order to identify the etiologic factors. A good example for exogenous factors is Epstein Barr virus (EBV) which is largely spread worldwide, over 90% of the adult general population being infected by it. EBV is believed to be implicated in Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, etc. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we will try to present the experience of two centers in Cluj County involved in the treatment of pediatric cancer, focusing on the influence of the presence of Epstein Barr virus in the outcome of the neoplasia. METHODS AND RESULTS: we took into account the clinical data regarding histology, stage of the disease, titer of specific antibodies for EBV, serological and imagistic evaluations of the patients treated in a retrospective consecutive manner for 5 years--2005-2010. Regarding our cohort of 120 patients, we analyzed the items in the paper in detail together with the statistical analysis and searched for a link between the intensity of the infection of EBV and response, disease, free survival, toxicities of the treatment. DISCUSSION: there are few data concerning the influence of EBV regarding the outcome of pediatric neoplasia. The published studies suggest a positive influence of EBV especially in Hodgkin disease mixed cellular subtype. In this study, EBV negative patients do better than the EBV positive, but the infection with EBV protects the patients against hematological toxicities.
