Secretory products of the lymphoblastoid line of human B-cells RPMI-6410t have a wide spectrum of biological activity. These products exert a growth-stimulating effect on B-cells of the 6410t strain obtained from the peripheral blood of a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia and cytotoxic and cytostatic effects, respectively, on B-cells of the Raji and P3HR-I.G5 lines obtained from patients with Burkitt's lymphoma. They also exert a cytotoxic effect on murine L-cells. Biological activity is relieved at 70 degrees and at low and high pH.
