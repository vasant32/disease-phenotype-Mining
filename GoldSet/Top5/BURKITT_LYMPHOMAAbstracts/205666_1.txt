A human lymphoma cell line, positive for the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated nuclear antigen, was recently established from a North American Burkitt's lymphoma. This cell line, SU-AmB-2, contained EBV DNA both in the form of circular, nonintegrated DNA molecules of viral genome length, present in multiple copies per cell, and as integrated sequences. Having DNA present in both of these forms, it resembled cell lines established from African Burkitt's lymphomas. In studies on EBV strain differences, the episomal viral DNA in Burkitt's lymphoma cells may now be compared with viral DNA in nonmalignant cells with the use of cell lines from Burkitt's lymphoma patients of similar geographic origin.
