The deliberate transfer of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) expression in mouse lymphoma L5178 cells was achieved by transfection with a cosmid DNA library prepared from human Burkitt lymphoma Ramos cells in which Gb3 was highly expressed. The recipient mouse lymphoma cells did not contain Gb3 but did contain its direct precursor, lactosylceramide. The transfected cells expressed Gb3, detected both chemically and immunologically, and contained human DNA detected by an Alu sequence probe. This model demonstrates a general method for studying glycosyltransferase genes and other factors necessary for the expression of glycosphingolipid antigens.
