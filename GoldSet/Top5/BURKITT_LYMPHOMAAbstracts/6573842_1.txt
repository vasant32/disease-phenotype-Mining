A case of L3 (Burkitt cell) leukemia with chromosome 1 abnormality but no detectable abnormalities of chromosomes 8 or 14 is reported. This is the first time that L3 leukemia has been shown to be associated with a primary abnormality of chromosome 1. The implications of these findings relative to the development of B-cell ALL and the role of chromosome 1 in human neoplasia is discussed.
