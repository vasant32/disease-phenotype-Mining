 BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Angiogenesis is an important mechanism in morbility of malignant tumor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the key factor. This study was to investigate the serum level of VEGF in children and adolescent patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). METHODS: The serum levels of VEGF(sVEGF) in 24 pretreated NHL patients were detected by ELISA. sVEGF in 10 of the 24 patients who received complete response after treatment were also detected by ELISA. RESULTS: The average serum VEGF level was 745.79 ng/L (40.64-3623.09 ng/L)in 24 NHL patients. It was higher than normal [(294.20+/-23.40) ng/L]. sVEGF in 18 of the patients were higher than the standard, while in 6 of the patients were lower than the standard. The average serum VEGF level was 289.54 ng/L (35.11-826.8 ng/L) in 10 of The CR patients, 8 cases of them had a high VEGF level before treatment but a nearly normal level after first CR. And 2 cases of them had normal level during the course. CONCLUSIONS: The serum level of VEGF in NHL patients was higher than normals. The high serum level of VEGF has a tendency to drop to the normal standard after receiving CR. From the clinical data, a high serum level was not found associated with stage, gender, PS. score, IPI score, serum LDH and "B" symptoms et al.
