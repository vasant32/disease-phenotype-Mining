Burkitt's lymphoma is a high-grade, rapidly growing B-cell neoplasm. It is recognized by its aggressive course, brief median survival, and low rates of long-term survival. The authors discuss the case of a patient who acutely presented with intraabdominal complications from a new onset of Burkitt's lymphoma. The clinical and pathological features, staging, treatment options, and survival data are reviewed. In addition, the role of surgical intervention is carefully analyzed.
