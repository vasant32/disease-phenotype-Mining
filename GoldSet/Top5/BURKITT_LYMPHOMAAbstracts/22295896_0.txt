Denis Burkitt's description of the eponymous lymphoma in 1958 in Uganda, opened up a vast and important field of enquiry in haematology and oncology. His pioneering experiments with chemotherapy demonstrated the possibility of cure, often with a single dose. His geographical explorations showed the tumour to be delimited by climate, suggesting an infectious cause vectored by mosquitoes. His clinical observations furthered the field of cancer immunotherapy. And his collegial, inquisitive nature facilitated the development of an enduring cancer research centre in Kampala. Burkitt's legacy in Uganda has wide-reaching effects that endure not only in Uganda but also throughout the haematology-oncology community to this day.
