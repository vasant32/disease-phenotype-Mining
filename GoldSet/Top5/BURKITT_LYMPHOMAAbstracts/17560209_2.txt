 BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Intussusception as a presenting feature of Burkitt lymphoma may be associated with early stage disease, which is curable with less intensive therapy. We determined the incidence, presentation, stage, and outcome of children with Burkitt lymphoma presenting with intussusception. METHODS: The medical records of patients with Burkitt lymphoma treated at our hospital from 1962 to 2005 were reviewed, and the patients presenting with intussusception were then further analyzed. RESULTS: Of 189 patients with primary abdominal Burkitt lymphoma, 33 (17.5%) presented with intussusception. Their median age at diagnosis was 10 years (range, 3-19 years). Most patients presented with abdominal pain (88%) and/or nausea/vomiting (42%). Twenty-three (70%) of these 33 patients as compared with 10 of the other 156 patients with abdominal lymphoma could have complete resection of their tumor (P < .0001) and hence had low stage disease (stage II). Only 10 patients with intussusception had stage III (n = 7) or stage IV (n = 3) unresectable disease. Twenty-five of the patients remained alive in continuous complete remission for 3 months to 31 years (median, 14 years). CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients with Burkitt lymphoma presenting with intussusception often have completely resectable disease and are older than general pediatric patients with intussusception.
