In two hemophilic brothers infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Burkitt's leukemia developed within 1 year. Both patients were treated by aggressive chemotherapy, and both are still in complete remission for 23 and 14 months, respectively. Sera from both brothers contained anti-HIV antibodies. However, DNA extracted from the tumor cells, when analyzed by Southern blot using a cloned HIV probe, did not reveal HIV-related sequences. Hybridization experiments with an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) probe revealed the presence of EBV-specific sequences in the tumors' DNA. In both patients' tumors rearranged c-myc genes were found. The rearrangements occurred in both genes 3' to the third exon of c-myc, thereby suggesting that a variant chromosomal translocation took place in both cases. Indeed, karyotype analysis of the malignant cells of one of the patients revealed the variant t(2:8) translocation. In contrast to the majority of Burkitt's tumors carrying this translocation, which are kappa light-chain producers, cells of our patient expressed lambda chains. Furthermore, in both cases the lymphoblasts carried IgG on the surface, again an unusual finding in Burkitt's tumors. Finally, because both patients had an identical HLA phenotype, the role of genetic factors in the development of such tumors should be considered.
