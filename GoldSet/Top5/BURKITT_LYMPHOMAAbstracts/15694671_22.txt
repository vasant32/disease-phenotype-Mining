NOTCH1 is involved in the pathogenesis of T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) carrying the very rare translocation t(7;9)(q34;q34.3). We analyzed the expression of genes belonging to NOTCH pathway, in acute leukemia primary samples and lymphoblastoid cell lines. NOTCH1 pathway activation represents a common feature of T-ALL when compared to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The contemporary expression of NOTCH1 and its ligands on cell surface contributes to high levels of pathway activity. AML primary samples show high levels of JAGGED1 expression despite the low NOTCH1 pathway activation, consistent with an autonomous JAGGED1 signaling in myeloid leukemogenesis.
