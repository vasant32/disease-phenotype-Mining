Antibody to Epstein-Barr virus-induced early antigen could be measured in sera using enzyme-linked antibody. The sensitivity of this assay was comparable to that of the indirect immunofluorescent technique. Measurement of early antigen was accomplished on a producer cell line which was specifically treated to block late gene expression. It is now possible to measure Epstein-Barr virus-induced early antigen and viral capsid antigen antibodies by using the same cell line.
