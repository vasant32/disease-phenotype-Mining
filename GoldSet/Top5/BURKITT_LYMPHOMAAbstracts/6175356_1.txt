Eleven biopsies from 9 patients with Burkitt's lymphoma were tested for their sensitivity to the cell multiplication inhibitory activity of interferon. Three were resistant to interferon while 8 were sensitive to various degrees. Different biopsies from the same patient did not differ in interferon sensitivity. These results indicate that Burkitt's lymphoma cells might be resistant to interferon already in vivo as previously shown for some derived cell lines tested in vitro. The results imply an inverse relationship between patient survival and interferon sensitivity of the tumor cells.
