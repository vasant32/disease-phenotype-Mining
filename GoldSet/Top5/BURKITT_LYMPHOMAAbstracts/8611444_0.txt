Activation of CD20, a cross-membrane ion channel, induces cell cycle progression from G0 to G1 in B lymphocytes. Subsequent activation of CD40, a membrane receptor of the nerve growth factor receptor superfamily, transits the B cells to the S phase. CD40 may also act synergistically in combination with IL-4 (B lymphocytes) or IL-3/IL-7 (B-cell precursors). We investigated the proliferative responses of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells to CD20/CD40 activation. In 18/56 ALL cases, CD20 activation resulted in significant increases in DNA synthesis. Similar, although more moderate, effects were seen of activation of CD40 in 10/44 cases. Responses to CD20 or CD40 activation were independent of co-stimulation with IL-3, IL-4 or IL-7, and various cocktails of the different growth stimuli did not act synergistically.
