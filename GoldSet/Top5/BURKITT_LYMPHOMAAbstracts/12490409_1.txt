We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation is controlled in part by nitric oxide (NO) generated from L-arginine (Arg). The spontaneous reactivation of EBV in the Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell line P3HR-1 was inhibited when the cells were cultured in L-Arg-supplemented medium. The expression of EBV early antigen (EA), immediate-early BZLF1 mRNA and the protein ZEBRA, and production of infectious virus were reduced by L-Arg supplementation in a dose-dependent manner. We demonstrated that inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA was constitutively expressed in P3HR-1 cells, as quantitated by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. L-Arg supplementation enhanced iNOS and NOx expression in the cells. A specific NOS inhibitor, NG-monomethyl-L-Arg enhanced the expression of ZEBRA and early BMRF1 protein EA-D in the cells. L-Arg supplementation also inhibited the spontaneous EBV reactivation in another BL cell line EB1 and a B lymphoblastoid cell line OB. These results indicated that L-Arg induces iNOS and generates NO, which inhibits EBV reactivation in EBV-positive cells.
