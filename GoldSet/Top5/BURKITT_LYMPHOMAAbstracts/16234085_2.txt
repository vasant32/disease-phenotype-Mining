Biliary obstruction secondary to malignancy is a common clinical problem. Rarely, biliary obstruction is due to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Obstructive jaundice in these patients usually presents late in the course of the disease. Burkitt's lymphoma is a subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Unlike other forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma presents as an extranodal disease. We present the case of a patient suffering from non-endemic Burkitt's lymphoma whose initial presenting symptom was obstructive jaundice.
