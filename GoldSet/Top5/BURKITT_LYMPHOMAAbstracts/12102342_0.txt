Technetium-99m (99mTc) tetrofosmin has been used as a tumor-seeking agent. However, its role in detecting lymphomas has not been widely investigated. The aim of the present study was to determine the uptake and clearance characteristics of 99mTc tetrofosmin in lymphoma cell lines. 99mTc sestamibi was also evaluated for comparison. Three lymphoma cell lines (U-937: monocyte-like, histiocytic lymphoma, human; RAMOS: B-lymphoma cell line, American Burkitt lymphoma, lymphoblastoid, human; Hs445: Hodgkin's disease, lymphoid, human) were studied. After incubation of radiotracers 99mTc tetrofosmin and 99mTc sestamibi in medium for 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min, the uptake and clearance of each radiotracer were measured in the three lymphoma cell lines. The uptake of 99mTc tetrofosmin was lower than that of 99mTc sestamibi in these lymphoma cell lines. Among the three cell lines, Hs445 showed the greatest 99mTc tetrofosmin uptake capacity. RAMOS and U-937 showed similar 99mTc tetrofosmin uptake capacities. 99mTc tetrofosmin accumulated in the three tested lymphoma cell lines, especially in the Hodgkin's disease cell line. However, in comparison with 99mTc sestamibi, 99mTc tetrofosmin may not be the best radiotracer for detection of lymphoma.
