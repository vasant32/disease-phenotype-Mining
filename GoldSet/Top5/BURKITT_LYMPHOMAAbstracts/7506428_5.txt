As presently reported, both ionizing radiation and engagement of the CD19 receptor are capable of inducing apoptosis in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. In both instances, activation of tyrosine kinases appears to be a proximal and mandatory step, since it can be prevented by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. This common biochemical signaling pathway involves the rapid activation of the Src family tyrosine kinase LCK (p56lck), which is physically associated with the CD19 receptor, and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates leading to stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover, and activation of protein kinase C. Importantly, engagement of the CD19 receptor promoted radiation-induced apoptosis in radiation-resistant B-lineage ALL cells in a cell type-specific fashion. Our results prompt the hypothesis that clonogenic B-lineage ALL blasts with an inherent or acquired resistance to radiation could be radiosensitized in clinical settings using anti-CD19 MoAb B43 or its homoconjugate as adjuncts.
