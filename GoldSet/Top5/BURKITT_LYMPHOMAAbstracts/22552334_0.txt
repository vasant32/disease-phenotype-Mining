 BACKGROUND: Lymphoma is the third most common pediatric malignancy. The purpose of this study was to analyze the incidence rates of lymphoma in children and adolescents in Brazil. METHODS: All cases of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) were extracted from 14 population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) from 2000 to 2005, and included children and adolescents 0-19 years old. Analyses included age-adjusted incidence rates (AAIRs) and age-specific incidence rates (ASIRs) by each PBCR. A social exclusion index (SEI) was built and used as proxy for socioeconomic status (SES) levels. Correlations between SES and incidence rates were investigated using Spearman's test. RESULTS: The median incidence of lymphoma was 22.7/million. AAIRs of lymphomas varied from 12.9 (Salvador) to 34.5 per million (SÃ£o Paulo). Median AAIR was 8.8/million, 9.8/million, and 2.9/million for NHL, HL, and BL, respectively. In all PBCRs except that of Recife, AAIR was slightly higher in males than females. The median ASIR was highest for HL (18.5/million) at 15-19 years for both genders. For NHL there were two peaks for ASIR: 11.1/million (1-4 years of age) and 13.2/million (15-19 years of age). The median ASIR for BL was highest among children aged 1-4 years (4.7/million) and in males. Higher SEI correlated with higher incidence of HL (P = 0.06), whereas rates of NHL and BL did not correlate with SEI. Borderline different incidence rates were observed in HL correlated with cities with higher SEIs. CONCLUSION: Incidence rates of lymphomas in Brazil do not differ compared to rates reported worldwide, although SES differences deserve further investigation.
