Hypermethylation of CpG islands is the most well defined epigenetic change in neoplasia and plays an important role in the inactivation or silencing of cancer related genes. DLX genes (1-7), with large CpG islands in their 5' region, are implicated in a number of processes among which haematopoiesis. They are characterized by highly dynamic spatio-temporal expression and supposed to be involved in resistance to apoptosis of several tumor cell lines. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) hypermethylation is a common phenomenon frequently associated with poor prognosis in specific genetic childhood leukemia subgroups. These data together with the presence of large CpG islands in the up-stream regions of the DLX genes make them attractive candidates for methylation regulated gene expression and leukemia related aberrancies. To validate the role of DLX genes in paediatric B-ALL cells, we studied two cell lines and two groups of patients with paediatric chromosomal rearrangements: MLL-AF4 and TEL-AML1, respectively. Analysis of methylation and gene expression patterns of DLX3 in 64 specimens of B-lineage ALL revealed that DLX3 presents aberrant methylation in paediatric B-ALL patients. In vitro experiments with 5-Aza-2'dC on leukemia cell lines, confirmed by Western blot analysis, indicated that the methylation of DLX3 CpG islands has a functional role and interferes with the DLX3 gene and DLX3 protein expression in B-ALL cells. Importantly, hypermethylation of DLX3 significantly reduces its expression in MLL-AF4 rearranged leukemias while methylation is almost absent in TEL-AML1 positive ALL specimens. These results show that differential DLX3 methylation could be a new epigenetic marker for genotypic B-cell leukemia subgroup with high-risk features.
