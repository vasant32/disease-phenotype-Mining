Susceptibility of lymphoma cells (Daudi, HD-Mar) to Newcastle disease virus toxicity was found to be higher than that of lymphoblastoid cells (Milstein) and of resting peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL). Phytohemagglutinin- and/or pokeweed-mitogen-activated PBL however, exhibited, elevated sensitivity, similar to that of lymphoma cells. The level of cytotoxicity was monitored by cell viability, inhibition of DNA synthesis and release of 51Cr. When Daudi cells were mixed with PBL they were significantly more sensitive to the killing effect of the virus (70% mortality compared to 30% 30 h after infection, P < 0.05). The degree of sensitivity to viral cytotoxicity was unrelated to the efficacy of adsorption, which was similar for all cell lines as shown by immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry. Also an influenza strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) adsorbed but did not affect the viability of any of the cells tested. Our results demonstrate that New-castle disease virus caused preferential damage to lymphoma cells as compared to non-cancerous normal cells.
