We investigated TEL/AML1 fusion mRNA in 108 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (86 B-lineage ALL, 15 T-ALL, two mixed lineage ALL, and five other phenotypes) using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). TEL/AML1 transcripts were found in 14 patients (13%) including three relapsed patients, and were unexceptionally limited to B-lineage ALL patients. The incidence of TEL/AML1 transcripts among B-lineage ALL was 16% (14/86). The reciprocal AML1/TEL transcripts were detected in 12 (86%) of the 14 cases expressing a TEL/AML1 transcript. In three cases, the TEL gene was fused to exon 3 of the AML1 gene, and to exon 2 in the remaining cases. To evaluate the amount of TEL/AML1 molecules for the quantification of a minimal residual disease (MRD), a plasmid vector which contained either a long TEL/AML1 PCR product (464 bp) or a short one (425 bp) was used as a competitor. We amplified RNAs obtained from bone marrow (BM) at complete remission or from peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvests in two representative cases. For one PBSC harvest showing a positive result, a competitive PCR was carried out to quantify the amount of MRD. A 1:4 dilution series of competitor vectors was constructed, and each vector was added to a PCR reaction which contain a constant amount of cDNA obtained from the PBSC harvest. An equivalent point was compared to that of corresponding samples at diagnosis. Using this method, MRD in the PBSC harvest was 3.9:10(3). Our results elucidated the incidence, lineage-specificity, and variant forms of TEL/AML1 fusion transcripts in childhood ALL. Since the percentage of other chromosomal translocations in childhood ALL is not more than 5%, TEL/AML1 transcript would be the most feasible clone-specific marker for these patients. In addition, our method could be a powerful tool for quantification of the TEL/AML1 transcript and for the detection of MRD.
