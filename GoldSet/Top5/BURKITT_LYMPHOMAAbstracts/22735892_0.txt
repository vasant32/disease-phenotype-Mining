Burkitt lymphoma (BL) has been reported to be strongly associated with Epstein-Barr             virus (EBV) infection. The fact that EBV is generally present in cancer cells             but rarely found in healthy cells represents an opportunity for targeted cancer             therapy. One approach is to activate the lytic replication cycle of the latent             EBV. Nuclear factor (NF)-κB is thought to play an essential role in EBV lytic             infection. Elevated NF-κB levels inhibit EBV lytic replication. Parthenolide (PN)             is a sesquiterpene lactone found in medicinal plants, particularly in feverfew             (Tanacetum parthenium). The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect             of PN on the survival of Raji EBV-positive lymphoma cells. Raji cells were treated             with 0, 4 or 6 µmol/l PN for 48 h. MTT assay and western blot analysis were performed             to evaluate the findings. Results showd that PN suppressed the growth of the EBV-positive             BL cell line, Raji, and activated the transcription of BZLF1 and BRLF1 by inhibiting             NF-κB activity. Most notably, when PN was used in combination with ganciclovir             (GCV), the cytotoxic effect of PN was amplified. These data suggest that the induction             of lytic EBV infection with PN in combination with GCV may be a viral‑targeted             therapy for EBV-associated BL.
