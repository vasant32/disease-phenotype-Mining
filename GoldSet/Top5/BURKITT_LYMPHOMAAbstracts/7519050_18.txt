The variant translocation t(8;22) in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells joins band q24 of chromosome 8 distal to the proto-oncogene MYC to the immunoglobulin lambda locus. The distribution of breakpoints on chromosome 8 of 11 cell lines with t(8;22) has been investigated by in situ fluorescence hybridization and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. We show that these chromosomal breakpoints generally fall within a region of about 300 kb 3' of MYC and that at least 8 out of 11 affect the previously characterized transcriptional unit PVT1. Comparable results were obtained in earlier experiments analyzing the variant t(2;8). Recently, in a series of BL cells carrying t(8;14), breakpoints upstream of MYC have been described at a similar distance. Therefore, our results suggest that deregulation of MYC by the immunoglobulin loci can occur at a distance of up to about 350 kbp of MYC.
