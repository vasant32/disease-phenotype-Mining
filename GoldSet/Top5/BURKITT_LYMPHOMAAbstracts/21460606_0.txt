Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is the second most common AIDS-related lymphoma. Primary sinonasal BL in HIV patients is extremely rare and treatment data in this subset of patients is almost nonexistent. Recently, a few studies reported promising results treating HIV-associate BL with an intensive chemotherapy regimen. The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAARTHAART) concomitantly with chemotherapy seems to improve patient outcomes, but this topic is still controversial due to potential drug interactions. We report a case of a 29-year old woman diagnosed with AIDS presenting with symptoms of chronic sinusitis. Subsequent investigation by CT scan and endoscopic biopsy discovered a sinonasal BL in an early stage. The patient was treated with intensive chemotherapy and HAARTHAART and achieved a complete remission and long-term immunologic recovery. This case report describes a rare entity whose natural history, treatment and prognosis is infrequently characterized in the medical literature.
