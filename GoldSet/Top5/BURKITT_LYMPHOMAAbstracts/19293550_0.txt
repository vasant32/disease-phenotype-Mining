We report a rare case of primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with Burkitt-like morphology. A 54-year-old man presented with multiple subcutaneous tumors. Pathological examination showed morphological features resembling Burkitt or Burkitt-like lymphoma (BL/BLL) with high MIB-1 positivity. Cytogenetic studies revealed no 8q24/c-myc translocation. After the diagnosis of Burkitt-like DLBCL, the patient was treated with CODOX-M chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, cytarabine and methotrexate), which led to durable remission. The present case suggests that short-term, high-intensity chemotherapy used for BL/BLL may be appropriate for primary cutaneous Burkitt-like DLBCL, as well as systemic lymphoma with Burkitt-like morphology.
