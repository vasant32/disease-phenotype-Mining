Overexpression of c-Myc in tumors is usually associated with cell proliferation and increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Concomitantly, c-Myc contributes to tumorigenesis by its ability to destabilize the cellular genome. Here, we examined whether c-Myc induces genomic instability and apoptosis in c-Myc-activated cells. Wild-type Myc (wt-Myc) and two mutated Myc myc box II proteins (mt-Myc) were overexpressed in IL3-dependent murine Ba/F3 cells. As expected, wt-Myc triggered apoptosis in absence of IL3. Standard karyotyping, spectral karyotyping, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed before and after c-Myc activation. Structural and numerical genomic instability was detected 48 h after wt-Myc activation and included gene amplification, the formation of extrachromosomal elements (EEs), chromosome breakage, deletions, increased aneuploidy, and polyploidization. Interestingly, some cells simultaneously displayed genomic instability and apoptosis. Both wt- and mt-Myc proteins were equally potent promoters of genomic instability. However, only wt-Myc simultaneously induced genomic instability and apoptosis. Mt-Myc proteins failed to induce apoptosis, thereby generating a strong imbalance towards the survival of genomically unstable cells.
