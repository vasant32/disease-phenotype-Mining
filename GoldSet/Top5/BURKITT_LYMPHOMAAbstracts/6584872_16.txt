A method is described for directly hybridizing a small number of sorted chromosomes with specific DNA probes. The chromosomes are analyzed by flow cytometry and sorted by deflecting the droplets containing the desired chromosomes onto a nitrocellulose filter. By using probes specific for the human Y chromosome, it has been possible to unambiguously identify the peak corresponding to the Y chromosome in the flow karyotypes of a variety of male cell lines. The position of this peak was found to vary significantly from individual to individual, correlating with the heterochromatin chromosomal polymorphism of the human Y chromosome. The sensitivity of the hybridization was such that, with a probe for a male-specific repetitive sequence, only 2,500 sorted chromosomes were enough to obtain a clear, positive signal; 10,000 were needed with a probe specific for a weakly repeated (maximum, 3-fold) sequence of Y chromosome. With this new method, chromosome sorting may be a rapid and efficient way to assign DNA sequences to chromosomes.
