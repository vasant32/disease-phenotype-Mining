 PURPOSE: B cell precursors acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) present rearrangements in the heavy chain immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes, especially in the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR-3) and T cell receptor delta (TCR delta) (V delta 2 D delta 3) regions. These rearrangements may be amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and used as clonal markers of B lineage ALL. Our purpose was to study clonality at the DNA level by PCR in B lineage ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three pediatric patients (36 with B lineage ALL, 7 with ALL-T, and 10 with nonlymphocytic disease) were investigated using consensus primers for the CDR-3 regions of IgH and TCR delta. RESULTS: Clonality was detected in 86.1% of the patients with B lineage ALL when the primers for the CDR-3 regions were used, in 41.6% when the primers for TCR delta were used, and in 91.6% when the two primers were used together. Biclonality was found in 22.5% and 6.6% of patients that have shown clonality for CDR-3 and TCR delta, respectively. Clonality was not detected in any other samples using these primers. CONCLUSIONS: PCR using CDR-3 and TCR delta primers can be used as an aid for B lineage ALL diagnosis and clonal evolution of theses disease.
