A study of ovarian tumours in young females under the age of 20 years in Papua New Guinea between the period 1976-1986 is presented. During these 11 years a total of 101 cases was seen among 802 ovarian tumours reported in all age groups. Epithelial tumours comprised the largest number (66.3%) followed by germ cell tumours (24.8%). Ten patients (9.9%) presented with torsion. Only 3 (3%) cases of Burkitt lymphoma were recorded (3%); the series included 1 case of primary non-gestational choriocarcinoma of the ovary in an 11-year-old premenarchal girl.
