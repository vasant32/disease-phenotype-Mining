We wished to learn whether the genomes of strains of EMB isolated from patients with infectious mononucleosis are consistently distinguishable from those of strains from Burkitt's lymphoma. The genome of a new transforming strains (FF41) of EBV isolated from saliva of a patient with uncomplicated infectious mononucleosis was compared with the DNA of B95-8, the only other available virus from mononucleosis. It had been found previously that B95-8 has a deletion of about 8 Md in the region of the physical map represented by the Eco RI C, Hind III D, and Bam HI I fragments. The W91 and HR-1 isolates for Burkitt's lymphoma are not deleted in this region and it had been proposed that additional information was characteristic of EBV isolates from Burkitt's lymphoma. By means of restriction enzyme analysis, blot hybridization experiments and molecular cloning of FF41 DNA we demonstrate that the deletion found in B95-8 is not present in the new mononucleosis isolate. The FF41 genome contains an extra 8 Md of DNA, represented by Bam HI fragments B', W' and I', which are located in a larger Eco RI C fragment. Thus the genome of this salivary isolate contains DNA that had previously been regarded to be unique to strains from Burkitt's lymphoma. It is therefore unlikely that major insertions or deletions in the EBV genome account for differences in disease manifestation following EBV infection.
