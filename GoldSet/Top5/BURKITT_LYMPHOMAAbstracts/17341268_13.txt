Epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressor genes (TSG) inactivates TSG functions. Previously, we identified PCDH10 as a methylated TSG in carcinomas. Here, we detected its frequent silencing and methylation in lymphoma cell lines including 100% Burkitt, 100% diffuse large B cell, 86% Hodgkin, 100% nasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma and 1/3 of leukaemia cell lines, and in primary tumours but not in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells or lymph nodes. PCDH10 silencing could be reversed by demethylation with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Methylation was further detected in 14% of Hodgkin lymphoma sera. Thus, PCDH10 methylation is frequently involved in lymphomagenesis and could serve as a tumour-specific biomarker.
