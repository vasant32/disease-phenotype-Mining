It has previously been shown that differential fucose labelling of many normal and homologous tumor cells, followed by proteolytic release and degradation, yields glycopeptides which upon gel filtration shown an increase in fast-eluting glycopeptides for the tumor cells. This technique has now been applied to cell-surface glycoproteins of different human hematopoietic cell lines. These lines included Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-carrying lymphoblastoid cell lines of presumed non-neoplastic origin, and malignant EBV-genome-positive Burkitt lymphoma and EBV-negative non-Burkitt lymphoma, leukemia and myeloma lines. As compared with normal peripheral lymphocytes, both the lymphoblastoid type of cell lines and the different types of lines of proven malignant ancestry contained the fast-eluting glycopeptides on their cell surface with very few exceptions. It is therefore concluded that (I) malignant conversion of human lymphoid cell in vivo is commonly, but not obligatorily, associated with a specific change in the composition of the fucosyl glycopeptides, and (2) EBV infection of B lymphocytes does not lead only to the well-documented immortalization in vitro but also, as a rule, to the same type of alteration in fucosyl glycopeptides as was demonstrated for the neoplastic cell lines. It proved possible to distinguish several categories of hematopoietic cell lines due to the effect that pretreatment of the glycopeptides with neuraminidase or mild acid exerted on their subsequent chromatographic behavior.
