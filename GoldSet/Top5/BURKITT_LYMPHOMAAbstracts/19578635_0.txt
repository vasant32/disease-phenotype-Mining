Hemophagocytic syndrome is a clinical condition characterized by the infiltration of the bone marrow and reticuloendothelial system by macrophages and activated histiocytes, leading to uncontrolled phagocytosis of platelets, erythrocytes, lymphocytes and precursor cells. It is a severe inflammatory and aggressive condition, characterized by high fever, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and cytopenia, and it may lead to organ dysfunction. This syndrome is classified as familial or acquired; the latter is more frequent and is associated with diverse conditions, such as infections, malignancies and rheumatic diseases. We report a case of HLH associated with cytomegalovirus infection in a patient with acquired-immunodeficiency syndrome and Burkitt's lymphoma.
