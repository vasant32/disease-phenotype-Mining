Antibody titers to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated early antigens (EA) and the viral capsid antigen (VCA) were determined by ELISA on 263 sera obtained from healthy donors, patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD), non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), infectious mononucleosis (IM), Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). As expected, most lymphoma patients showed markedly elevated anti-VCA IgG and anti-EA IgG antibody titers. Only one patient in the NHL group (n = 56) consisting of patients with lymphomas other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and hairy-cell leukemia (HCL), and 3 patients with HCL (n = 19) had high antibody titers of the IgA class to VCA and EA. Seventeen out of 48 patients (36%) with CLL had high IgA anti-VCA titers and 10 of these sera (21%) also contained IgA anti-EA. The geometric mean titer (GMT) of IgA anti-VCA was 2,510, the GMT of IgA anti-EA was 780. These antibody titers were about 10 times lower than the corresponding GMT of the NPC patients investigated in this study. The elevated IgG and IgA antibody titers to VCA and EA in CLL and HCL patients seem to reflect an immunodeficiency secondary to the malignant disease leading to reactivation of latent EBV infection. The possibility that at least some of these B-cell lymphomas are associated with EBV cannot be excluded.
