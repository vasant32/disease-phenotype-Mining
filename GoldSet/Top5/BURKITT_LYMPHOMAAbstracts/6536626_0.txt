A study was made of 527 cases of lymphoma diagnosed over the period 1960-1980 in the Department of Pathology of the University of Kinshasa. Of these cases, 115 were found to be Burkitt's lymphoma, the maxilla being the most frequently affected site. Most of the cases (74%) were diagnosed during the first decade of life and the majority (75%) of the cases of maxillary BL occurred in young children. The results show that the disease is quite common in Zaire and occurs in all the Provinces of the country and among all ethnic groups.
