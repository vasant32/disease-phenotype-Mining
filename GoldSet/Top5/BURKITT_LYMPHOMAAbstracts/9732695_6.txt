Cells of the Epstein-Barr virus genome-negative Ramos-Burkitt lymphoma (Ramos-BL) B cell line can be rescued from antigen receptor (AgR)-triggered growth inhibition and apoptosis by signals transduced through their surface CD40. This study investigates whether phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), which has been reported to be intimately involved in the regulation of normal and neoplastic cell growth, plays a role in CD40-promoted Ramos-BL B cell survival and uses the selective and reversible PI3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002 (LY). LY-mediated inhibition of PI3-kinase activity triggers growth inhibition and leads to the processing of caspase-3, caspase-3-like activity, cleavage of the death substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and apoptosis from the G1 phase of cell cycle. These data indicate that constitutive PI3-kinase activity is critical for Ramos-BL B cell progression through the cell cycle such that if this PI3-kinase-dependent pathway(s) is inhibited, the cells default to apoptosis. Signals transduced through CD40 abrogate LY-triggered caspase-3-like activity and PARP cleavage but fail to inhibit LY-triggered growth inhibition, processing of caspase-3, and apoptosis. Likewise, in the presence of LY, signals transduced through CD40 abrogate AgR-triggered caspase-3-like activity and PARP cleavage but fail to inhibit AgR-triggered growth inhibition, caspase-3 processing, and apoptosis. The LY-mediated induction of growth inhibition and apoptosis occurs in the presence of the CD40-induced anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL. Taken together these data indicate that the CD40 of Ramos BL B cells is linked to PI3-kinase-independent and -dependent routes of survival: CD40-mediated inhibition of AgR-triggered caspase-3-like activity, PARP cleavage, and CD40-triggered Bcl-XL expression are PI3-kinase-independent, whereas PI3-kinase is critical for CD40-mediated rescue of this cellular population from AgR-triggered growth inhibition, caspase-3 processing, and apoptosis.
