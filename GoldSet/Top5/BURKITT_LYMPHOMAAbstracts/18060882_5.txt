Increasing the levels of CD20 expression in cells that harbor low CD20 levels may enhance their responsiveness to CD20-specific antibody therapies. Here, we examined the regulation of CD20 expression after treatment with 0.5-2.0 Gy X-irradiation and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), in the presence or absence of known antioxidants, in the Burkitt lymphoma cell lines Daudi and Raji. Irradiation of cells enhanced cell-surface CD20 expression; the kinetics and extent of this change were cell-type specific and time-dependent. The kinetics of reactive oxygen species generation and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential after irradiation were also correlated with changes in CD20 expression. Raji and Daudi cells treated with H(2)O(2) showed a 2-to 2.5-fold increase in CD20 expression at 12 and 20 h, respectively. Buthionine sulfoximine, which depletes glutathione, also increased surface CD20, whereas antioxidants, such as PEG-catalase, PEG-SOD, vitamin C, and amifostine, decreased CD20 expression induced by radiation or H(2)O(2). The antioxidant-mediated decrease in CD20 expression induced by radiation or H(2)O(2) suggests a mechanism involving redox regulation. These results demonstrate the critical role of radiation-induced oxidative stress in CD20 expression and may have implications for defining and improving the efficacy of CD20-targeted antibody therapy and radioimmunotherapy.
