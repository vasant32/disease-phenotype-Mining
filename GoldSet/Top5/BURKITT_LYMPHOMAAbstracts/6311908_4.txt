Two Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific ELISA tests were developed. One, based on the use of crude extracts from virus producer cells highly induced in the presence of Ara C (providing EA + VCA- cells) or in the absence of the drug (providing EA + VCA + cells) is suitable for the detection of antibodies directed against antigen complexes associated with the lytic virus cycle; i.e., EA, VCA and presumably also MA. The second, performed with purified EBNA, can be used for the detection of antibodies to the transformation-associated nuclear antigen. The tests are expected to find application in the dissection of antibody responses of patients to various antigenic subcomponents, the monitoring of EBV-coded antigens during biochemical purification, and the screening of spent media from hybridoma cultures for EBV-specific antibodies.
