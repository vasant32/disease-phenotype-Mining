A 6-year-old boy presenting with swelling of cervical and axillary lymph-nodes was diagnosed as having an Epstein-Barr virus infection because of EBV-nuclear-antigen-positive B-lymphocytes in blood and lymph nodes and high antibody titres to EBV antigens. The natural killer activity of blood-lymphocytes was low, and so was the percentage of T-lymphocytes with Fc receptors for IgG (T-gamma cells). Chromosomal studies revealed a defect in the long arms of one of the chromosomes in pair no. 16 (16q22). The defect only appeared after addition of interferon to the lymphocyte cultures and preferentially in T-gamma lymphocytes. The disease progressed despite attempts to restore the patient's immune reactivity by interferon, transfer factor, and blood transfusions. Necropsy showed that the severe hyperplasia of lymph nodes found during life had become a Burkitt-like lymphoma. The possible connection between an interferon-induced chromosomal defect (break at 16q22) and reduced level of natural killer activity, reduced T-gamma lymphocytes, and proliferation of EBV-positive B-lymphocytes is discussed.
