The suspension lymphoblastoid cell line named ChSL-1 was established from the tumor node of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. The cells of this culture produce a virus with morphological and physicochemical properties of herpes viruses. Immunologic study of the isolated virus demonstrated great similarity with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).
