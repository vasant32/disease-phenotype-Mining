Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is involved in numerous lymphoproliferative diseases. In addition to classical lesions such as endemic Burkitt's lymphoma and infectious mononucleosis, there are other disorders of the lymphoid system that are discussed in relation to EBV: B-cell lymphomas in immunosuppressed individuals. Hodgkin's disease and, to some extent, primary extranodal lymphomas. Studies of the EBV expression in classical and nonclassical lesions could lead to the better understanding of different EBV mechanisms in lymphomagenesis.
