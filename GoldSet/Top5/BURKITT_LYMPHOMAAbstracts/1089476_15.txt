Lymphomatous diseases (non-Hodgkin's) of children differ markedly from those of adults in histology, natural history, and response to therapy. Information obtained from treating adults with lymphoma cannot be applied to children with equal success; the progress in treating children has been slow. The following types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have been distinguished in children seen at the M. D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute in the past 7 years: 1) diffuse undifferentiated lymphoma (Burkitt's lymphoma); 2) diffuse undifferentiated lymphoma (non-Burkitt's lymphoma lacking leukemic propensity); 3) diffuse poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (non-Burkitt's lymphoma with leukemic propensity (convoluted cell type); and 4) diffuse histiocytic lymphoma (histiocytic lymphoma). The interrelationships of age, sex, histology, and primary site are presented. The occurrence of mediastinal masses in non-Burkitt's tumor (convoluted cell type) is particularly striking. Therapeutic regimens designed for specific types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have improved the outcome of treatment in Burkitt's lymphoma, non-Burkitt's lymphoma (convoluted cell type), and histiocytic lymphoma (Stages I and II) as compared with treatment regimens used prior to 1967.
