The class II transactivator (CIITA) is a master regulator of MHC class II expression. CIITA also modulates the expression of MHC class I genes, suggesting that it may have a more global role in gene expression. To determine whether CIITA regulates genes other than the MHC class II and I family, DNA microarray analysis was used to compare the expression profiles of the CIITA expressing B cell line Raji and its CIITA-negative counterpart RJ2.2.5. The comparison identified a wide variety of genes whose expression was modulated by CIITA. Real time RT-PCR from Raji, RJ2.2.5, an RJ2.2.5 cell line complemented with CIITA, was performed to confirm the results and to further identify CIITA-regulated genes. CIITA-regulated genes were found to have diverse functions, which could impact Ag processing, signaling, and proliferation. Of note was the identification of a set of genes localized to chromosome 1p34-35. The global modulation of genes in a local region suggests that this region may share some regulatory control with the MHC.
