Group I and Epstein-Barr virus-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and the B104 lymphoma cell line which expresses a phenotype of immature B cells undergo apoptosis after cross-linking of their surface Ig receptors or after exposure to a calcium ionophore. We show here that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha protects these B cell lines against Ca(2+)-dependent apoptosis. Protection was associated with up-regulation of bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression. The increase of Bcl-2 expression induced by TNF-alpha was inhibited by chelerythrine, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), suggesting that Bcl-2 expression was dependent on PKC activation. Furthermore, we show that phorbol esters and cyclosporin A (CsA), which prevent Ca(2+)-dependent apoptosis, up-regulated Bcl-2 expression. The effect of CsA on Bcl-2 expression is controlled by calcineurin since we have shown that FK506 but not rapamycin had the same effect on Bcl-2 expression, whereas okadaic acid, an inhibitor of phosphatases 1, 2A and 2C, was ineffective. These data provide direct evidence that TNF-alpha prevents Ca(2+)-dependent apoptosis by a Bcl-2-dependent mechanism mediated by PKC.
