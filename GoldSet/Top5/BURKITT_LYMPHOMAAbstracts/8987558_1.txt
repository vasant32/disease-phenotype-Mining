The effects of oxidized cholesterols on proliferation and IgM production of human lymphoblastoid Namalwa cells were examined. An oxidized cholesterol mixture, in contrast to cholesterol, was a potent cytotoxin to Namalwa cells. Among oxidized cholesterols examined, 25-hydroxycholesterol was the most cytotoxic. However, no oxidized cholesterol examined suppressed IgM production, although cholestanetriol and 7-ketocholesterol did suppress it. Thus, oxidized cholesterols are cytotoxic to lymphocytes, while the influence on the immunoglobulin production may be marginal.
