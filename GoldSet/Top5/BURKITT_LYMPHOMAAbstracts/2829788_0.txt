Tumor tissue specimens of 25 patients with various entities of Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were examined for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nucleic acids and EBV nuclear antigens (EBNA) by in situ hybridization and anticomplement immunofluorescence. In tumor cells of five patients EBV nucleic acid and EBNA were demonstrated. The histopathologic examinations revealed in these cases one Burkitt's lymphoma, two centroblastic lymphomas and each one lymphoplasmocytic and lymphocytic lymphoma.
