Paranasal sinus and related malignancies affect air-containing mucosal-lined bony structures which can only be studied by appropriate radiologic examination. Pre-treatment staging by radiologic study, primarily utilizing tomography with complex motion, is essential for election of proper treatment modalities. It is the purpose of this presentation to define the conventional tomographic and advanced radiologic modalities which can be used in paranasal sinus radiologic examinations. The indications for the studies as well as their limitations are demonstrated. Finally, the role of radiology in post-therapy evaluation is noted.
