The occurrence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) specific DNase antibodies was measured in the sera of 400 patients. Three hundred sera were positive (greater than or equal to 20) for early antigen diffuse component (EA-D) antibodies, as measured by indirect immunofluorescence (IF). One hundred sera were EA-D antibody-negative but had IF IgG titers (greater than 40) to the viral capsid antigen (VCA). Twenty-nine of the anti-EA-D-positive sera, and 14 of the anti-EA-D-negative sera showed specific inhibition of EBV DNase. The mean age of positive male patients (39 years) for DNase antibodies was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than the mean age of positive females (27 years). Thirteen of the 40 patients (29.5%) with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had EBV DNase-neutralizing antibodies. No correlation between the level of anti-DNase antibodies and the antibody titer to EA-D or VCA was observed. These results support the notion that the EBV DNase antibody assay measures an independent index reflecting factual EBV disease.
