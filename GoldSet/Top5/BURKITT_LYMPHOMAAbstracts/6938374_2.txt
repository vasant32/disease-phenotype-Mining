Cells isolated directly from primary biopsies of Burkitt's lymphoma were found to activate the alternative complement pathway in hypogammaglobulinemic human serum. In contrast, cells isolated from patients with either acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or chronic myeloid leukemia did not activate. No defects in the ability of Burkitt's lymphoma sera to support alternative pathway activation were detected.
