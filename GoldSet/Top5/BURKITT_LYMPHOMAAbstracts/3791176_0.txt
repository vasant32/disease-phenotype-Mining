A case of diffuse large cell lymphoma with t(2p-;8q+) is reported. Immunologically the lymphoma cells were shown to be of B-cell origin and positive for surface gamma and kappa chains, B4, CALLA, and Ia1 markers. Karyotypically three major clones were detected: 47,XX, + 12,t(2;8)(p11-13;q24) (52%); 47,XX, + 12 (26%); and 46,XX,t(2;8)(p11-13;q24) (15%). A t(2p-;8q +) has been exclusively reported in cases of Burkitt's lymphoma or Burkitt-type acute lymphocytic leukemia. The present case is the first one with t(2p-;8q +) observed in non-Burkitt-type lymphoid malignancy of the B-cell lineage. The t(2p-;8q +) may play a primary role in the early stage of transformation of B cells, and trisomy 12 may provide them secondarily with an advantage for tumor progression. The phenotypic pictures provided by 8q24 rearrangements seem to be heterogeneous, as previously suggested.
