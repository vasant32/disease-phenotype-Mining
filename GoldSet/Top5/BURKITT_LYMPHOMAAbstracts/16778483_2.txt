Herpes zoster (HZ) occurs with an increased incidence in immunosuppressed patients, in whom it frequently displays atypical clinical presentations. Herpetic syringitis, the involvement of the eccrine epithelium by herpes virus infection, is an infrequently described histologic pattern that has been rarely and almost exclusively reported in HIV-infected patients. We report the case of a woman with Burkitt lymphoma who developed 2 nodular, asymptomatic lesions while receiving treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy for her hematological disease. Histology showed viropathic changes in the epithelium of eccrine glands not in the epidermis. PCR was positive for varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Nodular herpes zoster seems to be an exceptional clinical presentation. We report another such case which is, as far as we know, the first report of herpetic syringitis with no concomitant epidermal involvement.
