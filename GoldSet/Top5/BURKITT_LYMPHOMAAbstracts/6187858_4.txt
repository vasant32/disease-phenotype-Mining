In the Jijoye-P3HR-1 family of Burkitt lymphoma sublines, the expression of the B lymphoblast-1 antigen, BB-1, identified by the monoclonal antibody described by Yokochi and colleagues, was found to be strictly related to the expression of the EBV receptor/C3 receptor (EBVR/C3R) complex. It was absent on the receptor-negative P3HR-1 line, present in the original receptor-positive Jijoye line, and reappeared in nonvirus producer sublines derived from P3HR-1 itself. We suggest the BB-1 antigen is related to the EBVR/C3R complex in the Jijoye family, either at the level of genetic or epigenetic determination or at the level of steric interaction on the cell membrane. In all probability, however, the BB-1 antigen is not identical to the receptor itself. It is also clear that a similar relationship does not necessarily apply to other cell lines. In the course of the studies, it was accidentally discovered that propagation of the P3HR-1 cells on newborn instead of fetal calf serum induces the concomitant expression of EBV receptors, C3 receptors, and the BB-1 antigen. The mechanism of this induction is obscure; it does not appear to be related to any significant change in the frequency of virus-producing cells.
