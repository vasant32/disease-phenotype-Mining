Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus that causes infectious mononucleosis and is associated with several types of cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Burkitt's lymphoma. An EBV protein that plays an integral role during lytic replication is the immediate-early protein BZLF1. Our laboratory has found that BZLF1 (Z) localizes to host chromosomes during mitosis. Two Z-interacting proteins are also found localized to mitotic chromosomes in the presence of Z. The association between Z and mitotic chromosomes may lead to the sequestering of Z-interacting proteins within the cell and potentially cause an alteration of chromosome compaction or chromatin structure.
