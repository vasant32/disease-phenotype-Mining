Sixty-six cases of Burkitt's lymphoma were studied. Twenty-five of the cases had tumour involvement of the bowel. The commonest site of gastro-intestinal involvement was the stomach. No lesions were found in the oesophagus and rectum except in one case where the tumour was thought to have extended to the lower oesphagus from the cardia of the stomach. Attention is drawn to complications that may arise which require emergency measures and also to the infrequency of symptoms directly referable to bowel lesions. Illustrative case reports are given.
