Although the great majority of acute leukemias have been designated as being of lymphocytic or myelocytic origin, recent reports have described elements of both in some patients. We describe here the first case of hybrid acute leukemia in an HIV-antibody-positive patient as well as the first hybrid involving B-cell (Burkitt) acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute myelomonocytic leukemia proven by cytochemical, immunologic, and cytogenetic methods. This case illustrates the increasingly complex difficulties in the diagnosis and treatment of AIDS-related malignancies.
