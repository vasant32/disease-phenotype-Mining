We have determined the levels of cellular DNA polymerases and Epstein-Barr virus specific DNA polymerase in three Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines producing varying amounts of EBV, one of which was induced by 12-0-tetra-decanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). There was a proportional increase in the level of EBV-DNA polymerase with an increase in the percent of virus-producing cells. However, there was a reciprocal relationship between the levels of EBV-DNA polymerase and DNA polymerase alpha i.e., in cell line containing the highest level of EBV-DNA polymerase, activity of DNA polymerase alpha, but not of DNA polymerase beta, was reduced to an insignificantly low level. TPA does not have any direct effect on activities of either EBV-DNA polymerase or DNA polymerase alpha. EBV-DNA polymerases isolated from cells grown with or without TPA are indistinguishable in their properties such as elution position on phosphocellulose column, molecular weight, mono and divalent cation requirements, pH optimum, and other requirements for optimum activity. Addition of crude extracts of cells grown in presence of TPA to the purified DNA polymerase alpha did not inhibit its activity indicating that the observed loss was not due to any specific inhibitor present in TPA treated cells. Raji, a nonproducer cell line, did not contain EBV-DNA polymerase. There was no induction of EBV-DNA polymerase when Raji cells were grown in presence of TPA. The phenomenon of reduction in the levels of DNA polymerase alpha in cells induced to produce EBV may represent a mechanism by which the host DNA replication is shut off following virus infection.
