 BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) share epidemiologic characteristics suggesting a possible common etiology. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with HL, Burkitt lymphoma, some varieties of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHOD: Patients were located through MS databases for (a) Barking and Havering, NE London; catchment approximately 400,000; MS patient number 751, and (b) Nottingham, catchment approximately 2,000,000; MS patient number 1,236. Search was undertaken for lymphoma or NPC and diagnosis of MS verified by McDonald criteria. RESULTS: We identified five UK-born and resident patients of interest: (1) male with onset HL aged 20 years developing relapsing-remitting MS 11 years later; (2) female with severe relapsing-remitting MS whose partner developed NHL, 5 years after MS diagnosis; (3) female with secondary progressive MS beginning at age 38 years who developed NHL 25 years later; (4) female diagnosed with MS aged 19 years who developed HL 4 years later, and (5) female with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy developing cervical cancer at the age of 32 years, NPC at 33 years, and RR MS at 36 years. CONCLUSION: Our study supports a possible association between MS, HL, NHL, and perhaps NPC all of which are associated with EBV infection.
