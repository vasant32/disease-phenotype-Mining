We report an unusual case of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) presenting with jaw lesions in a 14-year-old Chinese boy. The patient presented initially with mobile teeth in all 4 jaw quadrants, with corresponding radiographic detection of alveolar bone crest destruction and periapical bone resorption in the absence of clinically detectable jaw tumors. Moreover, radiographs taken only 17 days later showed clearly distinguishable signs of more extensive alveolar bone destruction compared with the initial radiographs.
