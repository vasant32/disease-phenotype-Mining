Results obtained by the "cellular synchronization" method in 19 patients are reported; there were five Ewing's sarcomas, three nephroblastomas, nine neuroblastomas and two Burkitt lymphomas. Ages ranged between four months and six years. Most of them had metastatic diseases, resistent to previous therapies. The protocol consisted on vincristine as "synchronizator agent" days 1 and 2, and cyclophosphamide as "effector agent", days 3, 4, 5 and 6 of each pulse. The clinical and hematologic tolerance was generally good. Results were: 12 complete remissions, two partial remissions and three failures.
