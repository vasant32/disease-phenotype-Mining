It is well known that translocation between chromosomes 2 and 8, t(2;8)(p12;q24), has a strong association with Burkitt's lymphoma. It has rarely been seen in indolent lymphoproliferative disorders. In this study, we report for the first time on 2 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with t(2;8). They were diagnosed as having typical CLL (case 1) and CLL/prolymphocytic leukemia (case 2), respectively, based on morphology and immunophenotyping. Karyotypic analysis of the bone marrow cells using the R-banding technique revealed a karyotype of 47,XY, t(2;8)(p12;q24), +4,[17]/46, XY[9] in case 1 and a karyotype of 45,X, t(Y;7)(q12;q21),t(2;8)(p12; q24),del(12)(p12),-17[5]/46,XY[9] in case 2. T(2;8) translocation was confirmed by whole chromosome painting. Rearrangement of the MYC gene and loss of one p53 allele were detected by FISH only in case 2. Both cases had negative ZAP70 and CD38 expressions; however, only case 1 showed good response to therapy. We consider that MYC rearrangement, loss of one p53 allele as well as other factors, such as more prolymphocytes in the blood and bone marrow and complex chromosome abnormalities, also had adverse effects on the poorer prognosis of case 2.
