The c-fos proto-oncogene is found to be overexpressed at least 30-fold in SMS-SB, a pre-B leukemic cell line compared to other cell types. No gross alteration of the c-fos gene structure in SMS-SB cells can be detected by karyotypic or Southern analyses. C-fos in SMS-SB cells can still be induced by serum, TPA and the calcium ionophore, A23187, and superinduced by the combination of serum and cycloheximide. The elevated levels of c-fos transcripts are not due merely to an increased life span of mRNA, as the half-life of steady state c-fos mRNA in SMS-SB cells is about 40 min. Nuclear run-on transcription assays demonstrate that the transcription rate of c-fos in SMS-SB cells is up-regulated about 30-fold as compared to another pre-B leukemic cell line, NALM-6. In order to determine whether this is a cis- or transacting effect, we sequenced the 550 base pairs upstream of the SMS-SB c-fos coding region and found no mutations upstream of the mRNA CAP site. However, two point mutations at positions +23 and +98, respectively, were found in the 5' noncoding region of the first exon. Consistent with the overexpression of c-fos mRNA, the 55 kD c-fos protein is present in SMS-SB cells through detection by immunoprecipitation, but could not be detected in NALM-6 cells. SMS-SB cells however, do not appear to contain more abundant AP-1 DNA binding activity than NALM-6 cells.
