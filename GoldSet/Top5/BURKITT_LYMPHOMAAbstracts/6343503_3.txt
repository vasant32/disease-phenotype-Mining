A simplified assay to measure polymeric IgA-immune complexes in biological fluids is described. The assay is based upon the specific binding of a secretory component for polymeric IgA. In the first step, multimeric IgA (monomeric and polymeric) immune complexes are determined by the standard Raji cell assay. Secondly, labeled secretory component added to the assay is bound to polymeric IgA-immune complexes previously fixed to Raji cells, but not to monomeric IgA immune complexes. To avoid false positives due to possible complement-fixing IgM immune complexes, prior IgM immunoadsorption is performed. Using anti-IgM antiserum coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B this step is not time-consuming. Polymeric IgA has a low affinity constant and binds weakly to Raji cells, as Scatchard analysis of the data shows. Thus, polymeric IgA immune complexes do not bind to Raji cells directly through Fc receptors, but through complement breakdown products, as with IgG-immune complexes. Using this method, we have been successful in detecting specific polymeric-IgA immune complexes in patients with IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease) and alcoholic liver disease, as well as in normal subjects after meals of high protein content. This new, simple, rapid and reproducible assay might help to study the physiopathological role of polymeric IgA immune complexes in humans and animals.
