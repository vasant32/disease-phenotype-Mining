 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinicopathological features of primary Burkitt lymphoma of the seminal vesicle. METHODS: We reported the clinical characteristics, histological changes and the results of immunohistochemical staining and molecular in situ hybridization of 1 case of primary Burkitt lymphoma of the seminal vesicle. We also reviewed the related literature and studied the pathomorphological characteristics and differential diagnosis of the tumor. RESULTS: The characteristic manifestations of the patient were frequent micturition with dysuria, followed by inguinal lymphadenectasis 2 months later. Medical imaging showed a diffuse and monotonous infiltration of neoplastic cells with scanty cytoplasm and a few mitosis images. Microscopy displayed a starry sky pattern. The tumor cells were positive for CD10, CD20, CD79alpha, Bcl-6 and EBER in situ hybridization, but negative for CD3, CD6 and Cyclin D1. The Ki-67 index was > 95%. CONCLUSION: Primary Burkitt lymphoma of the seminal vesicle is a very rare tumor with aggressive behavior. The pathological diagnosis of the tumor depends on histopathological examination and immunohistochemical techniques. However it should be differentiated from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma and small cell carcinoma of the seminal vesicle or prostate gland.
