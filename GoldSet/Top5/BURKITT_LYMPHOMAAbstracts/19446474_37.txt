The full set of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the human genome is not known. Because presently known miRNAs have been identified by virtue of their abundant expression in a few cell types, many tissue-specific miRNAs remain unrevealed. To understand the role of miRNAs in B cell function and lymphomagenesis, we generated short-RNA libraries from normal human B cells at different stages of development (naive, germinal center, memory) and from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line. A combination of cloning and computational analysis identified 178 miRNAs (miRNome) expressed in normal and/or transformed B cell libraries. Most notably, the B cell miRNome included 75 miRNAs which to our knowledge have not been previously reported and of which 66 have been validated by RNA blot and/or RT-PCR analyses. Numerous miRNAs were expressed in a stage- or transformation-specific fashion in B cells, suggesting specific functional or pathologic roles. These results provide a resource for studying the role of miRNAs in B cell development, immune function, and lymphomagenesis.
