Complex compounds of ruthenium(III) with 1,2-dimethylimidazole (CAS 1739-84-0), 2-phenylimidazole (CAS 670-96-2) and 2-aminobenzimidazole (CAS 934-32-7) were prepared and were characterised by physicochemical methods. Coordination sites were determined. The complexes were tested for cytotoxic activity using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyithiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) dye-reduction assay and the values LD50 were evaluated.
