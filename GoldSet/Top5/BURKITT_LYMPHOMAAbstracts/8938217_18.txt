A consecutive cohort of patients with NHL was examined to identify the factors predictive of CNS-involvement with Cox's proportional hazards model in a multivariate analysis. Twenty-seven cases of CNS-involvement were found among 498 patients with NHL. Only 3 of 96 patients with low-grade lymphomas had CNS involvement, all occurring after transformation into high-grade lymphoma. In univariate analysis of 402 patients with intermediate or high-grade lymphoma, lymphoblastic histology (including Burkitt's lymphoma), age <35 years, B-symptoms, stage IV disease, testis involvement and bone marrow involvement were found to be statistically significant risk factors. Lymphoblastic histology was found to be strongly correlated to age younger than 35 years. In the multivariate analysis only lymphoblastic histology, stage IV disease and B-symptoms were found to be significantly associated with CNS involvement. It is concluded that CNS prophylaxis should be considered in all patients with lymphoblastic histology and in patients with stage IV B lymphomas other than those of low-grade types.
