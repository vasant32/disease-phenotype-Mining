A study of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) in Papua New Guinea for the years 1958-87 revealed four instances of familial BL. Incident cases occurred within 1 year of each other in the four families. Personal follow-up was possible for three of these families whose pedigrees showed that two or more siblings were affected. There was no significant variation of the incidence of BL by year of diagnosis or month of onset. There was significant variation in annual average incidence of BL between the three provinces studied, with the highest incidence in the Nuku and Lumi census districts (of the West Sepik Province). This is the first report of familial BL outside Africa.
