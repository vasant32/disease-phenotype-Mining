Burkitt's lymphoma primarily originating from the soft tissue is a very rare neoplasm. A five-year-old boy was admitted with a mass on the lateral side of the right breast. Radiological examination revealed a mass, which had originated from the soft tissue of the chest wall without any contiguous pleural and lung parenchyma disease. Histopathology showed this to be Burkitt's lymphoma. To our knowledge, this case is the first instance of Burkitt's lymphoma presenting as an isolated chest wall mass which originated from the soft tissue.
