Thirty-one Burkitt's patients and forty-eight matched controls from Uganda were HL-A typed to investigate possible antigen frequency differences which could suggest association of an HL-A antigen with disease susceptibility. Cells were shipped in tissue culture medium from Uganda to Oxford where they were HL-A typed using sera from the Fifth International Histocompatibility Workshop in the cytotoxic fluorochromatic assay. No significant frequency differences between patients and control were found.
