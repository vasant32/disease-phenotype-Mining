We have detected lactoferrin in tumor tissue from a patient with Hodgkin's disease and a patient with Burkitt's lymphoma. Both patients had radiogallium scans demonstrating increased uptake in the tumor tissue subsequently found to contain lactoferrin. Tissue assay for lactoferrin was performed by the indirect immunofluorescence method. Control splenic tissue showed either slight lactoferrin content or none.
