 PURPOSE: In this study, we sought to determine the occurrence of primary non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) in the oral and maxillofacial region among Nigerians. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied hospital records that included radiographs of all patients with a histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of NHL in the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife, Nigeria, between January 1992 and December 1997. Data were expressed as mean +/- SD or number (%). RESULTS: During the study period, 66 cases of NHL were recorded. Seventeen patients had concomitant extranodal lymphomas involving the gastrointestinal tract, nasopharynx, skin, lungs, kidney, and thyroid, in descending order. Three patients (4.5%) presented primarily with extranodal oral and maxillofacial disease. The ages of these patients ranged from 18 to 50 years (mean +/- SD, 32.3 +/- 16.3 years; median, 29 years). Within the same period, there were 121 cases of Burkitts lymphoma. The onset of lesions varied from 6 to 20 weeks. Two patients had intermediate-grade lesions; the remainder had low-grade lesions. Two presented with stage II disease, and the remainder were stage I. All of the patients had chemotherapy with remission of their lesions but were followed up to 6 months. Most of them did not complete the treatment cycles due to financial and social constraints. CONCLUSIONS: The rarity of primary NHL of oral and maxillofacial region has been aptly shown in this study. The need for the establishment of an effective oncology policy with the active collaboration of voluntary agencies is emphasized. This would ensure ready availability of the required chemotherapeutic agents and hospital care at affordable costs.
