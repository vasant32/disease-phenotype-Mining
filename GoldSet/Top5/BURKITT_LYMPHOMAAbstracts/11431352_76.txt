Development of the chimeric mouse antihuman CD20 antibody, Rituximab, presented a notable advance in the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Its use allowed the specific targeting of tumor B cells without the systemic toxicity of traditional therapies. The mechanisms by which Rituximab induces its antitumor activity are not fully understood. We have shown previously that Rituximab down-regulates Bcl-2 expression in some B-NHL cell lymphoma lines through an interleukin 10 (IL-10)-dependent autocrine loop, an effect that renders the resistant cells susceptible to chemotherapeutic drugs. The objective of this study was to delineate the signaling pathway by which Bcl-2 is controlled by Rituximab and IL-10. We hypothesized that the down-regulation of IL-10 by Rituximab decreases activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) protein, which in turn, is responsible for decreased levels of Bcl-2. We demonstrate by phosphoprotein immunoblotting and gel shift analyses that endogenous IL-10 induces activation of STAT3 in the 2F7 cell line. Furthermore, we show that Rituximab and anti-IL-10 antibody treatment decreases the ability of STAT3 to bind to its DNA binding site. The decrease in STAT3 activation by these treatments correlates with a decrease in Bcl-2 expression. Additionally, piceatannol, an inhibitor of STAT3 activation, down-regulates the expression of Bcl-2. Altogether, these results demonstrate that Bcl-2 expression is under the regulation of the STAT3 signaling pathway, which is regulated by endogenously secreted IL-10. Hence, Rituximab-induced down-regulation of IL-10 expression is responsible for the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and sensitization of NHL cells by therapeutic drugs. Furthermore, these findings support the notion that circulating IL-10 in vivo may control the resistance of NHL to drug-mediated cytotoxicity.
