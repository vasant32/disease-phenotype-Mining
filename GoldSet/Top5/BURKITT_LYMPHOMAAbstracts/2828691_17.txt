We analyzed 17 B-cell lineages cloned from two patients with infectious mononucleosis and found that different B-cell lineages exhibited notable variation in the length of the fused Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) terminal region on intracellular EBV episomes. EBV termini in different B-cell clones from the same person differed by as many as 15 to 20 reiterations of the ca. 500-base-pair terminal repeat sequence. In contrast, analysis of seven B-cell lineages cloned from a patient with a fatal, oligoclonal lymphoma revealed that three of the cell clones had the same-sized EBV terminal region. These three clones had previously been shown, by immunoglobulin gene analysis, to be metastatic daughter cells descended from a common progenitor. Similarity of the EBV terminal regions in the three daughter clones suggested that EBV infected the progenitor cell before proliferation and metastasis. Individual, EBV-infected cells from a single individual showed sufficient heterogeneity in their EBV termini to allow use of terminal fragment size as a clonal marker in studies addressing the contribution of EBV to the clonal pathogenesis of tumors with which this virus has been associated.
