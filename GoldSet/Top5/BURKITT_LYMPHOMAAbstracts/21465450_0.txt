There is an impending cancer epidemic in Africa. In Nigeria, this disease is causing untold devastation, and control measures are desperately needed. Breast, cervical, prostate, and liver cancers are the most common types in Nigerian adults. In children, the predominant malignant diseases are Burkitt's lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, neuroblastoma, and Wilm's tumor (nephroblastoma). The focus of efforts to control cancer in Nigeria should be directed at prevention with adequate attention to planning/policy making, early detection, accurate diagnosis, treatment and palliative care. National and regional allocation of sufficient resources is required, accompanied by measurable objectives and appropriate emphasis on accountability.
