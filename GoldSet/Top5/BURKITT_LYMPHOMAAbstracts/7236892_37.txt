Clinical and histopathologic material from 151 cases of diffuse mixed, diffuse histiocytic, and diffuse undifferentiated non-Burkitt's lymphomas have been reviewed to determine the factors that predict long-term survival. Median survival of all patients was 34 mo with 43% alive at 70 mo. Factors associated with a poor prognosis include: male sex, constitutional symptoms, advanced stage, bone marrow involvement, huge (greater than 10 cm) abdominal masses with gastrointestinal involvement, hepatic involvement, hemoglobin greater than 12 g/dl, or serum LDH greater than 250 U. The best prediction of a given patient's survival was defined by a set of four variables, which includes sex, symptoms, bone marrow status, and the presence or absence of a huge abdominal mass with gastrointestinal involvement. In contrast, classification of these patients according to the histopathologic categories of Rappaport of Strauchen did not define patient groups with significant differences in survival, nor did these categories correlate with the previously described clinical factors. Knowledge of the distribution of these prognostic factors in any clinical trial is needed before therapeutic results can be compared. In addition, such data may define subsets of patients for whom current therapy is inadequate and conversely those patients for whom current therapy yields excellent long-term survival.
