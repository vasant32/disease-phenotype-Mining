 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the B-NHL-BFM-90 protocol in the treatment of Chinese childhood and adolescent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHL). METHODS: Forty-two untreated childhood and adolescent B-NHL were enrolled in the present study. Of them 18 cases were Burkitt's lymphoma, 16 diffuse large B cell lymphoma and 8 anaplastic lymphoma. There were 10 cases in stage II and 32 in stage III/IV. The patients were grouped by risk factors into low, medium and high risk groups. All patients were treated with the B-NHL-BFM 90 (Berlin-Frankfurt- MÃ¼nster) protocol. The low risk group received A, B courses for 4 cycles, the medium risk group AA, BB courses for 6 cycles, and the high risk group AA, BB, CC courses for 6 cycles. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 37 patients (88%), and partial remission (PR) in 5 (12%). Of the 5 PR patients, I received autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 3 received radiotherapy for residual disease and 1 just under watching. Major toxicity was myelosuppression and mucositis, especially in AA, BB and CC cycles, but was tolerant and manageable. Median follow-up was 20 (4 - 89) months. Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyse survival data. Two year event free survival (EFS) for all patients was 86. 24%, being 100% for stage II and 80.95% for stage III/IV. CONCLUSION: Short term and intensive chemotherapy can improves the efficacy and survival rate of childhood and adolescent B-NHL, especially for advanced stage patients.
