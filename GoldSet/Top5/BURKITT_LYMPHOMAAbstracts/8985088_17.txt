We have registered 2,064 cases of cancer among the inhabitants of Conakry, Guinea, during 1992-1994, corresponding to age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) of 83.3 per 100,000 in men and 110.5 per 100,000 in women. As elsewhere in West Africa, the principal cancer of men was liver cancer (ASR 32.6), with modest rates of stomach (ASR 6.2) and prostate (ASR 8.1) cancers. In women, cervix cancer was the dominant malignancy (ASR 46.0), followed by liver cancer (ASR 12.5) and breast cancer (ASR 10.9). In contrast to contemporary East and Central Africa, Kaposi's sarcoma remained rare (only 4 cases). In the childhood age group, relatively high incidence rates were found for Hodgkin's disease, Burkitt's lymphoma and, especially, retinoblastoma.
