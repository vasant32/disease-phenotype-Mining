Sera from patients with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) were tested for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) determined antigens and for antibodies directed against various EBV-specific antigens. No correlation was found between EBV serology and ADCC in sera selected for high or low titres against the membrane antigens (MA) or in consecutive sera from three patients with isolated late tumour recurrences. Furthermore, no correlation was found between ADCC and tumour development.
