Euphorbia tirucalli (Euphorbiaceae family) an environmental risk factor for Burkitt's lymphoma also has pharmacological activities. In the northeast of region in Brazil its latex is used as an antimicrobial, antiparasitic in the treatment of coughs, rheumatism, cancer and other disease as folk treatment. The prevalent constituents of this plant latex are diterpenes from the Inganen types (ingenol esters) as well as the tigliane (phorbol esters). Scientifically, there is not any data till now about anticancer effects of the Euphorbia tirucalli Linn., since the Ingenol esters have already presented tumor-promoting ability. Microtubules (MTs), and cytoskeletal proteins are essential in eukaryotic cells for a variety of functions, such as cellular transport, cell motility and mitosis. Single Inganen in cytoplasm can interact with these proteins and affect on their crucial functions. In this study, we showed the effects of Inganen on MT organization using ultraviolet spectrophotometer and fluorometry. The fluorescent spectroscopy showed a significant tubulin conformational change at the presence of Inganen which decrease polymerization of tubulin as well as the ultraviolet spectroscopy results. The aim of this study is to find the potential function of Inganen for treatment of cancer in cells and human organs.
