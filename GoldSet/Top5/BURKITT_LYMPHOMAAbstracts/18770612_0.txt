Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was first reported as the etiological agent of Burkitt's lymphoma in 1964. Since then, EBV has also been associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which is highly prevalent in Southeast Asia, as well as infectious mononucleosis, complications of AIDS, and transplant-related B cell lymphomas. This virus has further been linked with T cell lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease, establishing the concept of a wide spectrum of EBV-associated malignant disorders. So far, there are a number of EBV-infected cell lines established that can be induced for production of infectious viral progeny and that facilitate the study of the mechanism of EBV-related infection, transformation, and oncogenesis. This unit describes procedures for the preparation of EBV virion particles and in vitro infection of cells with EBV. In addition, procedures for quantitation and storage of the virus are provided.
