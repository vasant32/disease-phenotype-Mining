Twenty seven B cell neoplasms were examined by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) and immune thin layer chromatography (ITLC) to determine ganglioside expression. Patterns of expression in the cells were compared with conventional morphology, genotype, and glycoprotein immunophenotype. Patterns of ganglioside expression were found for each of the tumor types analyzed (5 acute lymphoblastic lymphomas (ALL), 5 Burkitt's Lymphomas (BL), 4 chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL), and 3 diffuse poorly differentiated lymphomas (DPDL), 7 diffuse histiocytic lymphomas (DHL), and 3 multiple myelomas (MM). GM3 was the predominant ganglioside found in all B cell neoplasms except multiple myeloma where GM2 was equivalent to GM3. GM1 was detected by ITLC in all B cell tumors, but significant amounts were found by HPTLC only in ALL, CLL, and DHL. Small amounts of GD3 and GD2 were found in several B cell neoplasms. Significant amounts of other gangliosides were not found. The expression of GM2 on the MM cell lines, a cell type derived from outside of the nervous system, is unusual. This high level of expression was also seen in metabolic labeling studies. GM2 was readily detectable in the SKMM1 human multiple myeloma cell line by flow cytometry and served as a target for human complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Although the functions of gangliosides are largely known, the patterns of gangliosides found for this system of human B cell malignancies may serve to provide targets for specific immunotherapy and clues to their functions.
