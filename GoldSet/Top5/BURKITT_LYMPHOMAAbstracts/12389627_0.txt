A human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line, BALM-27, was established from the peripheral blood specimen of a patient with B-cell ALL L3 type (ALL-L3) at diagnosis. As with the original leukemia cells, the established line was negative for all cell surface immunoglobulin (Ig) chains, but carrying only cytoplasmic Ig delta heavy chain. Southern blot analysis of the various Ig chain genes demonstrated homozygous deletion of the Jkappa gene, germ line configuration of the Jlambda and rearrangement of IgJH genes. Cytogenetic analysis of both primary leukemic bone marrow and BALM-27 cells showed the der(8;15)(q10;q10) chromosomal alteration, in addition to the t(8;22)(q24;q11) abnormality which is highly associated with ALL-L3 and Burkitt's lymphoma. The established cell line BALM-27 represents a rich resource of abundant, accessible, and manipulable cell material for analyzing the unique expression of Ig chain and for investigating the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancy. The scientific significance of BALM-27 lies in (1) the rarity of this type of leukemia cell lines, and (2) its unique chromosomal aberrations.
