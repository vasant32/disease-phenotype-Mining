The Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) is speculated to be involved in cell transformation by the virus. Studies on the molecular properties of EBNA, however, have yielded conflicting results. In this study, three Epstein-Barr virus(EBV)-induced antigens were isolated and purified from extracts prepared from Raji cells. These antigens were able to block the anticomplement immunofluorescence reaction, indicating that all three were related to EBNA. The soluble antigen was found wholly in the cytosol fraction. An EBV-induced nuclear antigen I was found both in the cytosol and the nucleus. The EBV-induced nuclear antigen II was found associated with the chromatin. The soluble antigen and the nuclear antigen I were separated and partially purified using phosphocellulose chromatography. Each was further purified 1,400-fold with respect to the whole cell state by chromatography on CL-Sepharose 6B followed by blue dextran-Sepharose. subunit molecular weights of 70,000 were determined for each of these antigens, both in the crude and purified state, by radioimmunoelectrophoresis and gel filtration. The nuclear antigen II was purified 2,500-fold using hydroxylapatite, CL-Sepharose 6B, and blue dextran-Sepharose chromatographies. This antigen displayed two subunits by radioimmunoelectrophoresis with molecular weights of 65,000 and 70,000. Although all antigens shared similar molecular weights, the extent of their homology remains to be determined.
