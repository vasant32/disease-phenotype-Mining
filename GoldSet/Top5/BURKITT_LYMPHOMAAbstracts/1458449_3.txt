A mathematical model simulating lymphomagenesis based on the two-hit theory of carcinogenesis is presented by contrasting the biologic variables responsible for a high risk of developing Burkitt lymphoma (BL) in three immunosuppressed groups with that of nonendemic BL. In this model, the pro-B lymphocyte is considered to be the target for BL-specific translocations such as t(8;14). With repeated mitosis, the target cell pool expands in the high-risk individual, and, thereby, the opportunities for a spontaneous translocation to arise are increased. The chromosomal translocation endows the target cell with survival advantages, and, hence, lymphoma develops. Modeling results demonstrate that this increased cell proliferation is sufficient in accounting entirely for the increase in tumor prevalence. Preventing enhanced cellular proliferation by obviating immune deficiency and treating patients with agents that restore immunity or have antiviral and antiproliferative properties prior to conversion from polyclonal B-cell proliferation to monoclonal malignancy could obviate the development of BL.
