Secondary acute lymphocytic leukemias (ALL) are uncommon events in the pediatric patient population. There are few detailed reports on the laboratory characteristics and clinical course of patients with secondary lymphocytic leukemia. Historically, these patients have had a poor outcome. We report two patients treated at one institution who developed treatment-related secondary ALL. Both patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, one with a compatible unrelated donor cord blood unit and one with an HLA-matched sibling donor bone marrow. One of the two patients survives disease-free 3 years after transplantation.
