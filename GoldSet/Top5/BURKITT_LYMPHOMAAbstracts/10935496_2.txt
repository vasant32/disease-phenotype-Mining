We have investigated a single telomere expansion in a case of acute lymphoblastic B-cell leukemia (B-ALL), where half of the cells in the bone marrow sample appeared with a Philadelphia chromosome. Comparing telomere sizes in Philadelphia-positive versus -negative cells, we found generally shorter telomeres in the Philadelphia-positive cells, but with an expansion of the telomere on the long arm of one chromosome 11 homologue. This expansion was also found in a minority of Philadelphia-negative cells. The telomeres in these cells were of the same overall size as the telomeres in the Philadelphia-negative cells without the 11q expansion. Together, these findings suggest that the order of events was: 11q telomere expansion, Philadelphia translocation, overall telomere shortening. The expanded 11q telomere contained the standard telomeric (AGGGTT)(n) repeat, but also variant repeat sequences. The single telomere expansion suggests a non-telomerase mechanism behind the expansion which may also explain the presence of variant repeats in the expanded telomere. The present case illustrates that telomere changes may occur at only some chromosome ends in a subset of cells. To reveal such changes, telomere morphology should be studied with in situ methodology.
