Members of the BCL-2 gene family are well known for their role in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas in humans and in mouse models. A recent report that knockout mice deficient for the proapoptotic BCL-2 family member gene BAD frequently develop B-cell lymphomas prompted us to analyze a large collection of human B-cell lymphomas for inactivating mutations in the BAD gene. All 3 exons of the BAD gene were amplified and directly sequenced. The 81 lymphomas analyzed included 16 cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 11 mantle-cell lymphomas, 10 follicular lymphomas, 7 MALT lymphomas, 8 Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, 3 cell lines of multiple myeloma, 15 cases and 4 cell lines of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 7 Hodgkin's lymphoma lines. No mutations were found in any of the cases. We conclude that mutations in the BAD gene do not play a role in the pathogenesis of the major subtypes of human B-cell lymphomas.
