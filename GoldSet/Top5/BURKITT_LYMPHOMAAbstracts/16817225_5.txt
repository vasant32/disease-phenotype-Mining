Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects more than 90% of the human population and has a potential oncogenic nature. Trichostatin A (TSA) has potent antitumor activity, but its exact mechanism on EBV-infected cells is unclear. This study examined the effects of TSA on proliferation and apoptosis of the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Akata. TSA treatment inhibited cell growth and induced cytotoxicity in both the EBV-negative and -positive Akata cells. TSA sensitively induced apoptosis in both cells, as demonstrated by the increased number of positively stained cells in the TUNEL assay, the migration of many cells to sub-G1 phase by flow cytometric analysis, and the formation of DNA ladders. This suggests that EBV has no effect on the sensitivity to TSA. Western blot analysis showed that the cleavage of PARP and Bid and the activation of caspases are closely related to the TSA-induced apoptosis of the cells. The reduction in mitochondrial transition potential and the release of apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria to cytosol was also observed after the TSA treatment, but was suppressed by treating the cells with a cathepsin B inhibitor. Overall, these findings suggest that besides the caspase-dependent pathway, mitochondrial events are also associated with the TSA-induced apoptosis of Akata cells.
