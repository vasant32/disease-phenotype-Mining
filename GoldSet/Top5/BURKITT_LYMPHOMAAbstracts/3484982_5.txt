1255 cases of leukemia-lymphoma were tested between 1972 and 1984 by multiple marker analysis. Routine leukemia phenotyping was performed using standard morphological and cytochemical techniques in combination with clinical and histo-pathological information; the main emphasis was put on immunological surface marker analysis using erythrocyte rosette assays, TdT and a large panel of poly- and monoclonal antibody tests. The 1255 cases were divided into these major types and subtypes: 349 cases of ALL and related immature T- and Burkitt-lymphomas (cALL, pre B-ALL, B-ALL and Burkitt-lymphomas, T-ALL and immature, mostly leukemic T-lymphomas, Null-ALL), 454 cases of mature T- and B-cell malignancies (T-CLL, mycosis fungoides, Sezary-syndrome, T-lymphomas, B-CLL, hairy cell leukemia, multiple myeloma, B-lymphomas), 263 cases of acute myeloid leukemias (AML, AMMoL/AMoL), 182 cases of chronic myeloid leukemias (CML in chronic phase, CMoL, CML in blast crisis), 6 cases of erythroleukemia and 1 case of megakaryoblastic leukemia. A simplified classification scheme which has been used in our laboratories is presented. Phenotyping is of diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic relevance, most evidently for patients with ALL. Routine leukemia phenotyping should be performed with highly standardized techniques and reagents and by combining information from several fields in the multiple marker analysis. New areas of leukemia research might become very useful for the routine procedure of phenotyping.
