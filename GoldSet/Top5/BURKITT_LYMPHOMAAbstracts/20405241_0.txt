 INTRODUCTION: We report the first case of immunophenotypically confirmed primary hepatic Burkitt lymphoma presenting with acute liver failure. The patient survived following an aggressive diagnostic approach followed by emergent chemotherapy. DISCUSSION: Data from the primary hepatic non-Hodgkin lymphoma literature show a survival rate of 87% at 5 years with combination regimens of chemotherapy. However, mortality rate in this population is 85% in patients with acute liver failure. CONCLUSION: Primary hepatic Burkitt lymphoma may respond well to emergent chemotherapy even in the setting of acute liver failure.
