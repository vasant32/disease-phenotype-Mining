Treatment recommendations for endemic Burkitt lymphoma (BL) in settings with only minimum requirements for curative treatment (PODC setting 1) are described. The reported cure rate for endemic BL is usually <50%. Facilities within setting 1 differ. Three treatment schedules are proposed based on: (1) when accurate staging is not possible, (2) when staging is possible and for (3) relapses and poor responders to primary therapy. A literature review and personal experience were used to formulate the recommendations. Recorded 1-year event free survival was 48% for treatment 1, 61% for treatment 2, and 35% for the rescue treatment.
