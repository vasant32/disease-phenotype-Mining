An increased incidence of lymphoproliferative disorders in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients has long been recognised. Lymphoproliferative disorders occur in 2% of orthotopic liver transplant patients. Different therapies have been used, but the optimal treatment remains unknown. Relatively little information is available on experience with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Three children who developed Burkitt-like, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas after liver transplantation are described. The disease failed to regress after initial management, which included a reduction in immunosuppression. With cytotoxic chemotherapy all three achieved complete remission, which continued 36+, 35+, and 16+ months after diagnosis. Results suggest that in selected cases chemotherapy can be safe in late-onset lymphomas appearing after solid organ transplantation.
