The fine structure of metaphase chromosomes and nuclei were studied by scanning electron microscopy. A coiled-coil structure of chromosomes was suggested by hypotonically unravelled chromosomes observed under light microscope. But chromosome preparations made for the light microscopic studies were not adequate for detailed examination with scanning electron microscope. Surface-spread chromosomes revealed that they were composed of nodular, twisted looping fibers of about 300 A in diameter. Surface-spread nuclei were also composed of fibers identical to the chromosome fibers.
