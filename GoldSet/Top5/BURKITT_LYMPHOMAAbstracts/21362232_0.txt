This study was purposed to investigate the effects of phenylhexyl isothiocyanate (PHI) on Burkitt lymphoma Daudi cell line and regulation of histone acetylation and methylation in Daudi cells, and to explore the potential mechanism. The apoptotic rate of Daudi cells treated with PHI was measured by flow cytometry, the changes of histone H3 and H4 acetylation, histone H3K9 and H3K4 methylation in Daudi cells treated with PHI were detected by Western blot. The results showed that PHI could induce apoptosis of Daudi cells, increased the acetylation level of H3 and H4, enhanced the methylation of H3K4, but reduced the methylation of H3K9. It is concluded that the PHI can up-regulate the acetylation level of histone H3 associated with transcription stimulation and the methylation of histone H3K4, down-regulate the methylation on histone H3K9 associated with transcription inhibition, promotes the apoptosis of Daudi cells. PHI may be a potential agent for target therapy of lymphoma.
