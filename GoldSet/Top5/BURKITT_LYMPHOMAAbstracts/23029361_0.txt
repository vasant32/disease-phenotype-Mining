Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an important environmental factor associated to the development of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) in endemic and intermediate risk regions. However, little is known about the contribution of genetic constitution to the development and clinical response of the disease. The aim of this work was to investigate the role of EBV and Interleukin 10 (IL10) single nucleotide polymorphisms (-1082A/G, -819C/T, -592C/A) and microsatellites (IL10.R and IL10.G) in susceptibility and clinical outcome in pediatric BL patients, in a region with intermediate EBV association frequency. The frequencies of IL10 promoter Single nucleotide polymorphisms -1082A/G, -819C/T, -592C/A, and IL10.R and IL10.G microsatellites were compared in 62 pediatric patients and 216 healthy donors. IL10 -1082GG and GCC/GCC genotypes were more frequent in patients than in controls, and associated to a higher risk of BL development (GG genotype OR 2.62, 95% CI, 1.25-5.51; P = 0.008; Pc = 0.024). EBV was detected in tumor samples by EBER-ISH in 54.1% of cases. EBV+ patients exhibited a better event free survival (EFS) (P = 0.019) than EBV- patients. Carriers of IL10 R3-GCC had worse EFS (P = 0.028). Our results suggest a risk effect and an independent prognostic value of IL10 polymorphisms and EBV in childhood BL patients.
