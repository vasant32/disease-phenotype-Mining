Twenty-four patients with advanced malignant lymphoma including Hodgkin's disease (HD, n = 1), intermediate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (IGL, n = 12) and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (HGL, n = 11) were prepared for syngeneic (n = 2), allogeneic (n = 11) or autologous (n = 11) marrow transplantation with cytosine arabinoside, 3 g/m2 every 12h for 12 doses (HDAC) and total body irradiation, 200 cGy daily for 6 days (TBI) to determine toxicity and efficacy. Eight patients (33%) died from early regimen related toxicity and all eight had a Karnofsky performance score less than or equal to 80 at the start of treatment. The actuarial probability of disease-free survival was 17% with a 65% probability of relapse at 4 years after transplantation. Four patients are surviving 2-4 years post-transplant, three transplanted for IGL and one for HD. None of the patients transplanted for HGL survived. The result of this phase II study suggests that HDAC followed by TBI and marrow infusion offers no apparent advantage over cyclophosphamide + TBI for patients with relapsed advanced malignant lymphoma. Earlier transplantation currently is the only demonstrated method of achieving better results.
