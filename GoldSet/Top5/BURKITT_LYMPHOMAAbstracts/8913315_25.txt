Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) represents a high malignant B cell tumour. It has been proposed that cytokines are responsible for some of the characteristics of BL. We have analysed a panel of different BL and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) for the expression of cytokines, including: IL 1 alpha, IL 1 beta, IL2, IL3, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, TNF alpha and TNF beta and for the soluble cytokine receptor for IL2 (slL2R). Our results show that expression of IL8, IL10, TNF alpha or TNF beta was detected frequently in several of the Burkitt or lymphoblastoid cell lines. There was a correlation between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and cytokine protein production. Our results suggest that EBV promote the expression of IL8, IL10, TNF alpha and TNF beta.
