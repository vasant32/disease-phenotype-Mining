 OBJECTIVE: The viability of normal and malignant B-cells was shown to depend on the constitutive activation of the nuclear factor (NF)- kappaB pathway. Thus, attempts to find efficient inhibitors of NF-kappaB play a central role in the search for novel anti-B lymphoma therapies. We studied the effects of two NF-kappaB inhibitors, Bay 11-7085 (BAY) and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), on the viability of B-lymphoma cell lines. METHODS: We investigated the mechanism(s) of the cytotoxic effect of the NF-kappaB inhibitors, BAY, and CAPE on human-lymphoma and nonhematological cell lines. RESULTS: BAY and CAPE were shown to kill Ramos-Burkitt's lymphoma cells with IC(50) values of 0.7 microM and 4 microM, respectively. The rapid killing by BAY (h) vs the slower killing by CAPE (1-3 days), and their differential effects on the stages of the cell cycle, indicated that these drugs induce killing by different mechanisms. BAY and CAPE induced a loss of the cytoplasmic compartment and generated pyknotic nuclei, which lacked nuclear or nucleosomal fragmentation, features characteristic of necrosis rather than apoptosis. BAY also induced a rapid loss of the mitochondrial potential and rapid inhibition of p65 NF-kappaB binding to its kappaB motif without reducing the level of nuclear p65. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that BAY causes a necrotic rather than apoptotic cell death, either through its effect on the NF-kappaB pathway and/or by affecting additional molecular targets. The high sensitivity of B-lymphoma cell lines to the cytotoxicity of BAY, justify further research to explore its potential therapeutic effect on human B lymphomas.
