Acute leukemia cells express myeloid, B-lymphoid and T-lymphoid lineage specific antigens. Many acute leukemias express the hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen CD34. Three proposed models of the normal human hematopoietic stem cell include CD34+ Thy-1low Lin-, CD34+ CD38-, and CD34+ HLA-DR-. The patterns of expression of CD34, Thy-1, CD38, HLA-DR, and multiple lineage-specific antigens on 49 consecutive pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases submitted for immunophenotyping (36 at first diagnosis, 13 at relapse) were analyzed. CD34+ expression was observed in 67% of the cases. CD34+ expression correlated with Thy-1low expression and expression of myeloid antigens (p < 0.001 and < 0.025, respectively). The CD34+ Thy-1low phenotype was observed in 65% of the cases; the CD34+ CD38- or CD34+ HLA-DR- phenotypes were observed in only three cases. Examples of heterogeneous expression of CD34 and Thy-1 were found in six cases, but CD38 expression was always bright and homogeneous in all positive cases. The data from this analysis indicates that the CD34+ CD38- or CD34+ HLA-DR- phenotypes would be more useful than the CD34+ Thy-1low phenotype for distinguishing normal hematopoietic stem cells from leukemic cells in childhood B-cell precursor ALL.
