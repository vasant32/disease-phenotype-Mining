Cellular DNA polymerases of a Burkitt lymphoma-derived cell line (P3HR-1) were found to be greatly induced by treatment of the cells with 5-iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) at a concentration which induces Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) early antigen (EA) expression. The activities of all the DNA Polymerases alpha, beta and gamma in P3HR-1 cells increased 7-9 fold by exposure of the cells to IUdR (25 micrograms/ml) for 3 days, while the EBV-coded DNA polymerase activity in the cell remained undetectable under the assay conditions employed. Under the same culture conditions with IUdR, EA-positive P3HR-1 cells increased to 16.6% which was much higher than that of the non-treated control cells (0.32%). On the other hand, another Burkitt lymphoma cell line, Raji, had very low incidence (1.27%) of EA induction by IUdR-treatment and the level of DNA polymerase activities remained almost unchanged. From these results it seems that the increase in DNA polymerase activity during the treatment of P3HR-1 cells with IUdR is closely related to high incidence of EA expression in these Burkitt lymphoma cells. Also, the finding has revealed yet unknown effect of IUdR on cultured cells and provides a useful tool to obtain a large quantity of the induced cellular DNA polymerases from the P3HR-1 and KB cells.
