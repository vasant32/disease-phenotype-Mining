A specific chromosome translocation, t(8q-; 14q+), was observed in a 43-year-old female with non-African Burkitt's lymphoma in which leukemic conversion had occurred. The chromosome studies used cells from ascites. The ascites was apparently the result of a primary tumor involving the ovaries and contained 68% of lymphoma cells. The frequent occurrence of abnormalities related to chromosomes 1, 8 and 14 in African and non-African Burkitt's lymphomas was emphasized.
