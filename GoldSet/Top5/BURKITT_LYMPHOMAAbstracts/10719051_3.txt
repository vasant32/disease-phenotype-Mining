The Epstein-Barr virus is an agent that causes African Burkitt's lymphoma, infectious mononucleosis, and Hodgkin's disease. It is also related to nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of the Epstein-Barr virus in esophageal cancer. Polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization were used to detect the Epstein-Barr virus. We detected 103 Epstein-Barr virus positive cells out of 107 of KYSE 273 cells using first standard-PCR. Epstein-Barr virus DNA could not be detected in 30 of the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and 2 of the Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines. Out of 77 esophageal cancer patients, 3 cases were found positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA using polymerase chain reaction. However, by in situ hybridization we found signals in only 1 of the 3 cases, the signal was located in the infiltrating lymphocytes. The Epstein-Barr virus is rarely associated with esophageal cancer.
