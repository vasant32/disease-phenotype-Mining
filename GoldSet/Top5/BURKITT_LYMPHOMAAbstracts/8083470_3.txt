Despite the recent advances in knowledge of the molecular mechanism by which interleukin-4 (IL-4) induces IgE production, little is known about the signal transduction pathway that leads to this event. This study investigated the signal transduction mechanism responsible for IL-4-induced expression of germ-line C epsilon transcripts with use of a human Burkitt lymphoma B-cell line, DND39, which is known to express germ-line C epsilon transcripts in response to IL-4. On stimulation with IL-4, the generation of inositol triphosphate was observed in the cells. In addition, this generation was associated with activation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1). Although herbimycin A, a potent inhibitor of tryosine kinase, inhibited IL-4-induced activation of PLC-gamma 1 and generation of inositol triphosphate, direct phosphorylation of PCL-gamma 1 was not determined. Nevertheless, IL-4 stimulation could induce activation of FYN but not LYN kinase, suggesting that additional molecule(s) might link FYN kinase to PLC-gamma 1. Interestingly, herbimycin A almost completely inhibited IL-4-induced expression of germ-line C epsilon transcripts when present during the entire culture period. These results indicate that the induction of germ-line C epsilon transcripts in IL-4-stimulated DND39 cells is essentially dependent on the activation of tyrosine kinase, possibly FYN kinase.
