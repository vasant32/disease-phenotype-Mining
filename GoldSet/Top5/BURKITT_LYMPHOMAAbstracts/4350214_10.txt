Somatic cell hybrids of Burkitt lymphoblastoid cells, from which Epstein-Barr virus can be recovered, were examined for the presence of virus DNA by DNA-RNA hybridization. Four clones of hybrid cells, each negative for virus antigens by immunofluorescence, contained virus DNA in varying genomic equivalents. The number of virus genome equivalents increased in the hybrid cells after induction of virus with iododeoxyuridine.
