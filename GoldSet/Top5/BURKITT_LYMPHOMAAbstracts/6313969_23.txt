The two regions of the Epstein-Barr virus genome carrying partially homologous clusters of short tandem repeats (DSL and DSR [duplicated sequences, left and right, respectively] ) are transcribed into polyadenylated RNA upon spontaneous or chemical induction of the lytic virus cycle. In Raji, an Epstein-Barr virus genome carrying a nonproducer cell line, transcription of DSL and DSR is only observed upon induction of an abortive life cycle of the virus. In the nonproducer cell line Raji, the polyadenylated transcripts of DSL and DSR are about 2,500 and 2,700 bases, respectively, in length. Four different spontaneous Epstein-Barr virus producer lines, M-ABA, CC34-5, QIMR-WIL, and B95-8, differ in the length of their DSL and/or DSR regions by different numbers of tandem repeats. The size of the RNAs corresponds in all cases to the size of the respective cluster of repeats, indicating that a large part of each RNA species is colinearly transcribed from the entire tandem repeat arrays. Both the DSL and the DSR RNAs have the same polarity proceeding from right to left on the Epstein-Barr virus genome. DNA sequence analysis of the DSR repeat revealed that translation of the RNA would be possible in three open reading frames within the repeat cluster. Short homologies to herpes simplex virus IR-TR sequences and to immunoglobulin switch region sequences (IgH-S) are discussed.
