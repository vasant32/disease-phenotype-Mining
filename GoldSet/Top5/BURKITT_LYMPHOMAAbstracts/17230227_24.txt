Chromosomal translocations joining the immunoglobulin (IG) and MYC genes have been extensively reported in Burkitt's and non-Burkitt's lymphomas but data concerning MYC rearrangements with non-IG partners are scarce. In this study, 8q24 breakpoints from 17 B-cell lymphomas involving non-IG loci were mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In seven cases the breakpoint was inside a small region encompassing MYC: in one t(7;8)(p12;q24) and two t(3;8)(q27;q24), it was telomeric to MYC whereas in four cases, one t(2;8)(p15;q24) and three t(8;9)(q24;p13) it was located in a 85 kb region encompassing MYC. In these seven cases, partner regions identified by FISH contained genes known to be involved in lymphomagenesis, namely BCL6, BCL11A, PAX5 and IKAROS. Breakpoints were cloned in two t(8;9)(q24;p13), 2.5 and 7 kb downstream from MYC and several hundred kb 5' to PAX5 on chromosome 9, joining MYC to ZCCHC7 and to ZBTB5 exon 2, two genes encoding zinc-finger proteins. In these seven cases, MYC expression measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was significantly higher when compared to that of patients without 8q24 rearrangement (P=0.006). These results suggest that these rearrangements are the consequence of a non-random process targeting MYC together with non-IG genes involved in lymphocyte differentiation and lymphoma progression.
