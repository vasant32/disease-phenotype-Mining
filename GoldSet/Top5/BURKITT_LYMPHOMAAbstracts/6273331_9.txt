Burkitt's lymphoma was diagnosed in male Algerian child presenting with abdominal and jaw tumours. Viral studies revealed that this non-endemic case was associated with the Epstein-Barr virus. Cytogenetic examination of tumour cells showed a complex three-way rearrangement involving chromosomes 2, 8 and 9. Our report indicates that, in Burkitt's lymphoma, not only simple but also complex translocation involving chromosome 8 may arise. This finding in a North African case emphasizes the need for more detailed study of the clinical, virological and cytogenetic features of Burkitt's lymphoma throughout the world.
