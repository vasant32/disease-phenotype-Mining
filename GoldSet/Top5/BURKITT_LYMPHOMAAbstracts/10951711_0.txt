A 33-year-old patient, hitherto healthy, has been admitted for clarification of bilateral mammary hypertrophy. In the course of the usual routine examination a lump of the size of a cherry was identified in the right breast. Within 6 weeks both breasts had become tight and grown symmetrically to three times their original size. A provisionary diagnosis of high malignant non-hodgkin lymphoma was made by multiple high speed needle biopsies and was later confirmed by a surgical tissue specimen of the right breast. For further classification a bone-marrow biopsy was taken from the pelvic bone and an immature acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), known as preB1-ALL, diagnosed. Sonographic examination, computer tomography of the thorax and mammographical findings, as well as symptoms, outcome and differential diagnosis of a proliferative lymphatic disease with first manifestation in both breasts are presented and discussed.
