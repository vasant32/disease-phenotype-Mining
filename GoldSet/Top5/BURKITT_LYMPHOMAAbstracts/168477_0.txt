Three different forms of cancer--the Burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and skin cancer--are discussed in their relation to geographical distribution, the possible role of viruses, and genetic predisposition. Certain general conclusions in regard to cancer follow from these discussions. It is stated firmly that cancer is not a disease but a tissue manifestation which has not only many different presentations but also many different complex causes which consequently will need many different forms of treatment. A comparison of geographical differences is of immense value.
