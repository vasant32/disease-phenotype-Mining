Shiga-like toxin-1 (SLT-1) is a bacterial toxin that kills cells by inhibiting protein synthesis. SLT-1 is composed of one cytotoxic A-subunit and five B-subunits that bind to CD77, a cell-surface glycolipid. In the human hematopoietic system, CD77 expression is restricted to a subset of activated B cells and derived cancers. Here we report that SLT-1 treatment of murine bone marrow ex vivo effectively cures severe combined immunodeficient mice of a human B-cell lymphoma xenograft while sparing normal hematopoietic precursor cells. Flow cytometry results using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled SLT-1 B-subunit show the high prevalence of expression of SLT-1 receptors (CD77) in human non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, especially follicular lymphomas. These results suggest the use of SLT-1 for the purging of human bone marrow before autologous bone marrow transplant in the case of CD77+ B-cell lymphomas as just one of many possible uses.
