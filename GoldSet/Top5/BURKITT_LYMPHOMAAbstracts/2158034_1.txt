We previously established an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome-positive epithelial hybrid cell line, designated NPC-KT, which was prepared by fusing primary epithelial cells derived from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with an epithelial Ad-AH cell line. In this study, we measured the presence of the EBV receptors using radiolabelled EBV. It was determined that similar amounts of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL)-derived P3HR-1 or NPC-KT-derived EBV can attach BL-derived Raji cells, but that only P3HR-1 virus can attach to NPC-KT cells. In addition, the superinfection of NPC-KT cells with P3HR-1 virus could not be inhibited by pretreatment with a monoclonal antibody against C3d (OKB7). Raji cells adsorbed with OKB7 became much less susceptible to superinfection with P3HR-1 or NPC virus. The data suggest that EBV receptors unrelated to C3d receptor exist.
