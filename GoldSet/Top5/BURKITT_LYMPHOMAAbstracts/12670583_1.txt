Metastasis to the penis is an unusual event. Bladder and prostate tumors are the main sources of penile metastasis. Other sites include the rectosigmoid, kidney, and, less frequently, the pancreas, liver, nasopharynx, and lung. Other sources include malignant melanoma and Burkitt's lymphoma. The differential diagnosis includes idiopathic priapism, venereal or infectious disease, tuberculosis, Peyronie's disease, and primary penile tumor. Chondrosarcoma of the jaw is responsible for 10% of all chondrosarcomas that originate with craniofacial bones. Its behavior is usually characterized by local aggression; however, distant metastasis is uncommon. We report a case of chondrosarcoma of the jaw with penile metastasis. This is the first case described in published medical reports.
