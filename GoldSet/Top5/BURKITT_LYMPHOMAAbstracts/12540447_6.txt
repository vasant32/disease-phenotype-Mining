OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and to describe the CT findings of renal lymphoma in children. CONCLUSION: Renal lymphoma was seen in 11 children, most commonly due to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 10, 91%) and Burkitt's subtype (n = 5, 45%). Multiple bilateral masses were the most common CT appearance. Less common presentations included focal solitary masses or an engulfing mass. Retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement and other organ involvements were common associated findings. Five of six patients with renal involvement at initial diagnosis have had cures or remissions. Therefore, renal involvement at the time of initial diagnosis with lymphoma does not portend a poor prognosis.
