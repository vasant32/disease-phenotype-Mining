The antigens of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 are detected and localized in vitro in Hep-2 cells by indirect and direct immunoperoxidase. The direct procedure is applied successfully for the diagnosis of genital disease on cytosmears of cervical cells of patients with herpes simplex type 2 infection. With other procedures, as anti-complement immunoperoxidase (ACIP) and anti-IgG immunoperoxidase (AIIP) the Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen (EBNA) was detected precisely in EB3, Jijoye and Raji lymphocytes using anti-EBNA antibodies from patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma or Burkitt lymphoma, in dilution 1:10-1:5120. The indirect immunoperoxidase localized intracytoplasmic early antigen (EA) in 5% of EA--positive Raji cells induced by superinfection of EBV. The viral capsid antigen (VCA) is detected by this method in 5%-10% of virus producing cell lines Jijoye and P3HR-1. The standardized kits of immunoperoxidase procedures for diagnosis of intracellular viral antigens using monoclonal antibodies are under investigation.
