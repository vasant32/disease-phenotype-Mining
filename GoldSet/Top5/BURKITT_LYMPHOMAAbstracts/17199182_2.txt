AIM: Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a rare condition, which should be well known to all paediatric medical facilities dealing with bone marrow and solid organ transplantation. The spectrum and the primary detecting modality of the initial imaging findings in paediatric transplant recipients with abdominal and soft-tissue PTLD should be studied retrospectively. METHOD: 7 children/adolescents (female: 4, male: 3; age: 3 - 19 yrs.; study period: 7 yrs.) after heart (5), kidney (1) or liver (1) transplantation were evaluated regarding their initial clinical and imaging findings of PTLD. RESULTS: 6 patients had a latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. PTLD presented with clinical symptoms in only 5 patients (ileus: 2, soft-tissue swelling: 2, intussusception: 1) and was detected on routine abdominal ultrasound (US) controls in the remaining patients. US was the primary imaging modality in all children and led to suspecting PTLD in 6 patients. In the seventh case, US had been misinterpreted first. Compared to US, additional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computed tomography (CT) better demonstrated the extent of the disease in 3 children, but were even inferior in another 3. There was no completely false-negative US examination during the study period. CONCLUSION: US is reliable for detecting as well as excluding abdominal and soft-tissue PTLD in paediatric patients after solid-organ transplantation and might even be superior to MRI/CT. Therefore, all patients with an increased risk of developing PTLD should be closely monitored by ultrasound. MRI/CT may be reserved for supplementary imaging in cases incomplete or equivocal on US, but are primarily essential in all patients with a localisation of PTLD not accessible by US.
