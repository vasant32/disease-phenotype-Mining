 OBJECTIVE: To determine the spectrum of malignant lymphomas in our set up, according to the WHO classification. METHODS: All the cases diagnosed as malignant lymphoma, during the year 2005, were retrieved from the institution based tumour registry record and classified according to WHO criteria depending on the immunohistochemical results of a panel of lymphoma markers. RESULTS: The male to female ratio was 2.5:1 for almost all types of malignant lymphomas. The age range was 3 to 80 years. The frequency of Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma were higher amongst the children, whereas follicular lymphomas, mantle cell lymphoma and CLL/SLL were more frequently reported in 5th, 6th and 7th decades. Of the total cases 62% were nodal and 38% extranodal (majority in the GI tract). Non Hodgkin's lymphoma was more (73%) frequent than Hodgkin's disease. Mixed cellularity and nodular sclerosis were the main histological variants of Hodgkin's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemistry is not very frequently used in our set up and also at very few other centres. Therefore, its application should be encouraged to raise the quality of data on lymphoid neoplasms and contribute to their control.
