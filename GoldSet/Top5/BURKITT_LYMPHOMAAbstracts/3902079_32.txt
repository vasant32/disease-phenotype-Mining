A DNA glycosylase which catalyzes the release of thymine residues damaged by ring saturation, fragmentation, or ring contraction from double-stranded DNA has been used to characterize such base derivatives in gamma-irradiated DNA. It is shown by chromatographic analysis that irradiation of DNA in neutral solution generates the ring-saturated forms cis-thymine glycol, trans-thymine glycol, and a monohydroxydihydrothymine, probably 6-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymine. The latter compound is only observed after irradiation under hypoxic conditions. The ring-contracted thymine derivative 5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantoin is also formed, and it is the major lesion after irradiation of DNA under O2. Ring-fragmented products such as methyltartronylurea were only generated in small quantities. Isolation and analysis of the DNA from gamma-irradiated human cells also revealed the formation of ring-saturated thymine derivatives, but 5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantoin was not found in this case.
