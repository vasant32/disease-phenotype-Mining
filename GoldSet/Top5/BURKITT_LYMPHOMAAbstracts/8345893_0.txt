Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is seen in approximately 5% of patients with AIDS. In recent years, the incidence has increased due to an extension of the average lifespan of HIV-infected individuals. In this article we describe the histological and clinical features of 45 patients with HIV-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma seen at the Academic Medical Centre between 1984 and 1991. There were 43 men and 2 women with a median age of 40 years. Most patients had high-grade B-cell lymphoma; 85% had extranodal sites. Prognosis was poor: overall median survival was only 3.8 months. Twelve patients were treated with 3 or more courses of chemotherapy: their median survival was 8 months. In 7 of 12 patients a complete remission was obtained; their median survival was 18 months. A history of AIDS was a poor prognostic factor.
