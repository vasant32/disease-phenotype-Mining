The anthracycline derivatives are intercalating drugs which are of major importance in the treatment of leukemias and in the management of solid tumors. Structural analogs have been prepared by semisynthetic modifications in an attempt to extend the spectrum of antitumor activity and to reduce toxicity (acute myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity). This report concerns our preliminary clinical experience in 111 patients who received detorubicin. Two dose schedules were used in acute leukemia patients. Sequential doses were active in acute leukemia relapses but the mucous membrane toxicity was excessive; more recently, intermittent doses proved active in acute leukemia relapses (one 6-mg/kg dose) and in a patient with resistant Burkitt's lymphoma. In non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, a complete response rate of 71% was achieved with an intermittent schedule (3 mg/kg/day X 3 weeks). A remarkable shrinkage of skin involvement was also observed. Detorubicin showed a high activity in mycosis fungoides (five regressions among six patients) and some activity in soft tissue sarcomas, osteosarcomas, and various solid tumors.
