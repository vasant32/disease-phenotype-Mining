Cancer may develop in connection with rare, genetic diseases or after exceptional, environmental exposures. Most commonly, however, cancer results from an unhappy coincidence of normal, genetic factors and ordinary, environmental conditions. Oncogenes are normal growth genes. Anti-oncogenes are normal regulatory genes which control growth genes. Cancer may result from changes (mutations) in an oncogene (such as in the Philadelphia chromosome), or from the lack of control of normal oncogenes. The latter may be due to loss of function of a suppressor gene (mutation in an anti-oncogene, such as in retinoblastoma) or through a change in the position of an oncogene (such as in Burkitt's lymphoma and in certain leukemias).
