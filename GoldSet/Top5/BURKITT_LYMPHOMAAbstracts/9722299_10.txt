The CD95 system plays an important role in lymphocyte homeostasis, has been implicated in the development of lymphoid malignancies, exerts a tumour suppressor function, and contributes to drug-induced cytotoxicity. We hypothesized that mutations of CD95 may occur in childhood B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), a disease known for its constitutive resistance towards CD95-mediated apoptosis. We investigated 32 primary B-lineage ALL of childhood and five B-lineage ALL cell lines. All primary leukaemias expressed CD9 5 and bcl-2 to a variable degree. Most of the leukaemias were resistant towards CD95-mediated apoptosis. However, using SSCP analysis, no mutations in the coding and proximal promoter region could be detected. We conclude that the resistance towards CD95-mediated apoptosis observed in most de novo B-lineage ALL is not caused by mutations of the CD95 death receptor.
