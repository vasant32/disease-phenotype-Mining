The DNA sequence of Raji DNA spanning the deletion found in B95-8 cells has been determined. Three open reading frames and a region of homology with the BamHI-H fragment are found within the deletion. The deletion contains a region of 102-bp repeats which is transcribed into an mRNA. The Raji sequence reported here varies slightly from a smaller M-ABA sequence reported previously. This paper completes the sequence of all parts of the wild-type Epstein-Barr virus genome.
