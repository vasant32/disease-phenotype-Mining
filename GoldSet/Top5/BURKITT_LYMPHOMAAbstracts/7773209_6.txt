Based on our previous studies demonstrating marked anti-tumor activity of interleukin-2 (IL-2)-activated bone marrow in vitro and in vivo, we studied the generation of anti-tumor cytotoxic effectors from chemotherapy- and growth factor-mobilized PBSC from 12 patients with different solid tumors. As chemotherapy and growth factor priming could lead to important qualitative and quantitative alterations of lymphoid cells, we also looked at the distribution of lymphoid cells contained in primed PBSC. In addition, different variables were defined for successful application of the technique to clinical protocols. The cells were placed in culture at varying cell densities in either serum-containing or serum-free culture medium, supplemented with IL-2, 100 or 1000 Cetus units/ml at 37 degrees C for 24 or 72 h, in flasks or in culture bags. Anti-tumor cytotoxicity was tested against A375 (melanoma), K562 (CML) and Daudi (Burkitt's lymphoma) cell lines in standard 4 h 51Cr release assay. Marked cytotoxicity was seen against all cell lines tested (A375: 32.7% +/- 5.2; K562: 52.8% +/- 4.8; Daudi: 50.5% +/- 7.2). Cytotoxicity was comparable in serum-containing and serum-free culture conditions and in tissue culture flasks and bags. Cell density up to 10 x 10(6)/ml was not associated with any significant decline in cytotoxicity. IL-2 activation of PBSC after thawing led to the generation of cytotoxicity comparable to that obtained with fresh PBSC. On flow cytometric analysis, the proportion of CD8+ T cells and NK cells (CD56+) was found to be higher in primed PBSC than in control peripheral blood mononuclear cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
