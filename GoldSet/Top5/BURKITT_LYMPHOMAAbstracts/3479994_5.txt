The effects of combinations of dipyridamole, an effective blocker of the salvage pathway of DNA synthesis, and 8 types of anti-cancer drugs on the growth of human T, B and myeloid leukaemia/lymphoma cell lines in vitro were examined. In combinations, dipyridamole and vincristine (VCR), and dipyridamole and vindesine had synergistic inhibitory effects. Dipyridamole reduced the efflux of VCR from cells and enhanced their VCR accumulation in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of up to 10 microM in the lymphoid cell lines, MOLT-3 and BL-TH, and of up to at least 20 microM in the myeloid cell line, ML-1. Dipyridamole also enhanced the accumulation of VCR in PHA-stimulated and un-stimulated lymphocytes of normal donors, but efflux of VCR was more rapid from normal lymphocytes than from cultured cell lines. It is proposed that combination therapy with dipyridamole plus VCR should be effective in the treatment of leukaemia and lymphoma.
