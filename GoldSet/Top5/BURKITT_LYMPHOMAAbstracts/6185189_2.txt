Human alpha and beta interferons increase the rate of class I human MHC antigens mRNA HLA-A, B, C and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) in most human cells studied so far. The present work studies the effect of those interferons upon cell lines which do not express class I antigen on their membrane: K 562 et Daudi. If beta 2m mRNA is enhanced in K 562 cell by both alpha and beta interferons, those interferons are not able to promote the de novo synthesis of HLA-A, B, c mRNA, which is not detectable in this cell line. On the other hand, HLA-A, B, C mRNA, which is present in Daudi cell, is amplified by both alpha and beta interferons. Furthermore, we could show that, if it has not been possible to detect mature beta 2m protein either in the cytoplasm or on Daudi membrane, there is a poly A+ RNA in it, which hybridizes with a cDNA probe specific for beta 2m.
