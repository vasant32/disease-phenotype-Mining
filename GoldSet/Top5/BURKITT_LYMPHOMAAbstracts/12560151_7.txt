Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is one of the fastest growing malignancies in the pediatric population in the United States. BL is a high-grade B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) which exists in endemic, sporadic, and human immunodeficiency-associated subtypes. The African, or endemic, variant usually involves the maxilla and other facial bones while head and neck manifestations in non-endemic BL are rare. We present three unusual present ations of sporadic BL stemming from Waldeyer's ring and the orbit. The clinical and pathologic features of BL are reviewed.
