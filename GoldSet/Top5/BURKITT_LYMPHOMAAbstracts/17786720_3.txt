SV40 DNA sequences have been detected in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. A link between SV40 and NHL is biologically plausible since SV40 causes hematological malignancies in laboratory rodents. We investigated 266 Egyptian cases of hematological malignancies (158 NHL, 54 HD, 26 ALL, 13 AML, 8 CLL, 7 CML) and 34 subjects as a control for detection of SV40 DNA using nested PCR. SV40 DNA sequences were found in (53.8%) of NHL, (29.6%) of HD and in (40.7%) of different types of leukemia cases. Frequency of SV40 DNA sequences was higher in NHL patients compared with those with the other tumors and control group (p < 0.05). The highest frequency was in Burkitt's lymphoma followed by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The present study suggests that SV40 is significantly associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and most probably acts as a cofactor in the pathogenesis of these tumors. This could lead to new diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive approaches.
