We have previously found that the protein which bound to the essential region of human autonomously replicating sequences (ARS) could be the c-myc proto-oncogene product. Here we examined the binding specificity of human ARS binding protein purified from Burkitt's lymphoma Raji cells. Among several oligodeoxynucleotides, this protein bound to the fragments containing the sequence of 5'-CAPyCTCTNA-3'. Competition analysis revealed that the ARS binding protein could recognize not only the nucleotide sequences but also the high ordered structure.
