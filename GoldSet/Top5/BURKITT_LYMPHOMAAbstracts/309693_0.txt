In 1974 we suggested a schedule of the pathogenesis of CML. CML was described as a variant of the cutaneous lymphadenoid infiltrate (Fig. 2). Four years later, the schedule still appears to be valid, even to explain the three types of pseudolymphoma (Table 3). Recent findings concering. Burkitt's lymphoma and Mycosis fungoides fit in well with the proposed schedule. In studying CML recognition of the malignant lymphomatous cell is most important. Progress in immunology should make it possible to destroy these malignant cells by immunological measures since the cells belong to one clone.
