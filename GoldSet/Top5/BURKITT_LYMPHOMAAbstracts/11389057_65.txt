Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) were evaluated by flow cytometry in immunodeficient mice bearing human lymphoma. A trend toward higher CEC values was observed on days 7 and 14 after transplant, and differences versus controls were highly significant on day 21 (P = 0.0061). A strong correlation was found between CEC and tumor volume (r, 0.942; P = 0.004) and between CEC and tumor-generated VEGF (r, 0.669; P = 0.02). In mice given cyclophosphamide, most of the circulating apoptotic cells were hematopoietic and not endothelial. Conversely, in mice given endostatin, all of the increase in apoptotic cells was in the endothelial cell compartment. CEC evaluation is promising as a noninvasive, surrogate angiogenesis marker.
