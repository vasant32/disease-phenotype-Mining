We have studied five cases suggesting a relation between Epstein-Barr virus infection and primary lymphoma of the central nervous system. A 48-year-old man had primary lymphoma of the central nervous system in the absence of systemic lymphoma or immunosuppression. Development of the tumor was associated with serologic evidence suggesting a recent primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus. DNA preparations from tumor tissue, but not from adjacent normal brain tissue, contained Epstein-Barr virus genomes when hybridized with a probe consisting of the BamHI K fragment of Epstein-Barr virus strain FF41. Evaluation of serum samples from four additional patients with central-nervous-system lymphoma revealed patterns of Epstein-Barr virus-specific antibody that were suggestive of an ongoing infection with EBV. Our results suggest induction of the lymphoma by Epstein-Barr virus.
