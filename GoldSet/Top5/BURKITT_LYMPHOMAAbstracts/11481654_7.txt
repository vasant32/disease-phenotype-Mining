The majority of anterior mediastinal tumors in children are malignant. The most common tumors in this location are lymphomas, germ cell tumors, and thymic masses. Most require an operation, either a biopsy or a resection, for cure. Because of their size and location, patients with these masses are at significant risk for cardiopulmonary complications when general anesthesia is administered. Of the many clinical, functional, and radiologic criteria used to identify the children at greatest risk for anesthetic complications, the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and the tracheal cross-section area seem to be the most reliable. General anesthesia should not be administered to children if the PEFR and a tracheal cross section area are both less than 50% of predicted values. If both are greater than 50% of predicted values, general anesthesia can be administered safely. An algorithm is proposed for the preoperative evaluation and management of children with anterior mediastinal tumors.
