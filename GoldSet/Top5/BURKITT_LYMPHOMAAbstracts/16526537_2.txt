 OBJECTIVE: The authors review the epidemiological and histological features of urogenital tumours in Cameroon. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective study over a period of 18 years based on registries and clinical data of patients admitted to the Urology department of Yaound√© Central Hospital. RESULTS: A total of 2,371 urogenital tumours were identified, corresponding to 520 prostatic adenocarcinomas, 1,066 cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia, 41 testicular tumours (9 seminomatous tumours, 7 non-seminomatous tumours, 18 lymphomas, 4 benign papillomas and 2 rhabdomyosarcomas of the spermatic cord), 169 bladder tumours (25 transitional cell carcinomas, 70 squamous cell carcinomas, 67 adenocarcinomas, 2 lymphomas, 1 sarcoma and 1 benign papilloma), and 136 kidney tumours (20 Wilms tumours, 87 renal cell carcinomas, 6 transitional cell carcinomas, 16 lymphomas, 2 other malignant tumours and 5 adenomas). This survey also revealed 192 epididymal tumours, essentially cysts, 8 squamous cell carcinomas of the penis and 3 adenocarcinomas of the female urethra. Other tumours corresponded to condylomata acuminata. CONCLUSION: Urogenital tumours in Cameroon are dominated by prostatic tumours. The urogenital tract can also be the site of endemic Burkitt lymphoma in this country. These tumours are observed in young subjects.
