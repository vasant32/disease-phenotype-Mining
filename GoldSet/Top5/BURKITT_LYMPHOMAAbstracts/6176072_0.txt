The results of the study of the anticellular effect of alpha-interferons of various origins (human, porcine, and bovine) on the growth of human lymphoblastoid cells (Namalva and J-96). Both homologous (human) and heterologous (porcine and bovine) leukocyte interferons produced a similar anticellular effect on the cells under study. All 3 types of interferon inhibited proliferation of lymphoblastoid cells. No such effect of these interferons on the control (diploid) cells was observed.
