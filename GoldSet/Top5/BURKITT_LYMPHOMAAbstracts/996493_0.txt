A case of histopathologically proven Burkitt's lymphoma is described with special reference to clinical, serological and immunological features. This case report is followed by a review of the literature on the problem of American and African Burkitt's lymphoma. We can state that there is good correspondence between the white and black Burkitt's lymphomas with regard to epidemiology, histopathology, therapy and some immunological aspects. The two groups differ from each other in age, primary tumor manifestation, involvement of the bone marrow at time of diagnosis and quantitatively in the positive EBNA-test. It is therefore suggested that black and white Burkitt's lymphoma are not different diseases but different patterns of one disease.
