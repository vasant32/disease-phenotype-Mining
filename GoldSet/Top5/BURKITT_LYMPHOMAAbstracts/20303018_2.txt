In recent years it has become increasingly evident that MYC rearrangements are not confined to classical Burkitt lymphoma (BL), but also occur in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and in the new subtype, "B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and BL" (BCLU), which was recently described in the 2008 revision of the World Health Organization classification. The accurate identification of MYC rearrangements in these three subtypes of high-grade lymphoma is becoming increasingly critical both in terms of diagnosis of classical BL and in light of the prognostic implications in cases of DLBCL and BCLU. We describe three cases of high-grade lymphoma in which cryptic insertion events, resulting in clinically significant IGH-MYC rearrangements, were detectable using an IGH/MYC three-color, dual-fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe set, but were not detected using break-apart MYC FISH probes, thus highlighting the limitations of using break-apart probes as a stand-alone test, particularly with the increased use of interphase FISH analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections in the diagnostic work-up of these patients.
