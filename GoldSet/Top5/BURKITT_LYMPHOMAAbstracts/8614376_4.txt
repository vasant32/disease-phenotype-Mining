The importance of the cellular pharmacokinetics of cytarabine triphosphate (ara-CTP) with regard to therapeutic efficacy is well established. In vitro and in vivo monitoring of pharmacokinetic parameters of leukemic blast cells were initiated in order to contribute to the pharmacological basis of optimal ara-C treatment strategies. Peripheral or bone marrow blast cells from 66 leukemic patients [51 acute myelogenous leukemia (ALL), 15 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (AML) were separated and incubated with ara-C for 1 hour and in ara-C-free medium for another 3 hours, and the intracellular formation and retention of ara-CTP was measured. In eight children who received continuous ara-C infusion for induction treatment, the ara-CTP concentration in circulating blast cells was monitored in vivo. The in vitro values observed in this assay corresponded to the cellular levels monitored in vivo. The ara-CTP retention differed clearly among the individual groups, as classified by immunophenotype at the time of the initial diagnosis: non-T-ALL 67+/-25% (x+/-SD, n=33), T-ALL 37+/-15% (n=8), and AML 34+/-18% (n=14). The difference in ara-CTP retention between non-T-All and AML (P<0.05) as well as T-ALL (P<0.05) was significant. There was a tendency toward lower ara-CTP retention in relapsed as compared with newly diagnosed ALL, but the difference was not significant. The maximal accumulation of ara-CTP (after 1 hour incubation) was comparable in AML, T-ALL, non-T-ALL, and blast cells from children in relapse. The observed similarity of cellular accumulation in all groups and the significantly more rapid decrease in T-ALL and AML provide the pharmacokinetic rationale supporting the prolonged infusion duration for ara-C in these subgroups as an alternative to the intensification by high-dose ara-C schedules with short-term infusion.
