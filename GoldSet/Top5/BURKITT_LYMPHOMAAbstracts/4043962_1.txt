Conditioned culture medium from Daudi cells was used as a source of soluble H-Y antigen. Concentrated culture medium was labeled with 125I and then fractionated by gel filtration. Column fractions were assayed for the presence of H-Y antigen by urease-ELISA. H-Y antigen-containing fractions were then pooled and subjected to an improved immunoprecipitation protocol. Three predominant H-Y antigenic proteins were identified with estimated molecular weights of above 200,000, 50,000, and 20,000.
