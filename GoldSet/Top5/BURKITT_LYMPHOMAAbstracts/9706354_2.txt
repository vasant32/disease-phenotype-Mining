We report a case of unilateral primary Burkitt lymphoma of the breast. It occurred in a young woman with a history of recent abortion, as a painful mass confused with an abscess. The diagnostic was suggested after fine needle aspiration. Biopsy allowed confirmation, by revealing a B-phenotype lymphoma with intranuclear Epstein-virus small RNA (EBER) in all cells. Additional investigations (clinical and radiographic) were negative (no lymphadenopathy). Chemotherapy induced rapid and complete remission. Patient is in good health (no local recurrence) 5 years later.
