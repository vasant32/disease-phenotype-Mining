A 45-year-old white male, bisexual, with a 2-year history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prodrome, developed a Burkitt cell-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Marker studies of marrow blasts show an unusual and possibly unique pattern, in that an unequivocal monoclonal B cell leukemia, having K-IgM with HLA-DR and B cell subset antigen (BA-1) expression, was superimposed with a mature suppressor T cell marker profile (pan-T, mature T, and suppressor/cytotoxic T antigens). The leukemic blasts were totally negative for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), human T cell leukemia-lymphoma virus (HTLV) p19 antigen, and other immunoglobulin isotypes. Chromosome analysis of marrow cells disclosed that 70% of the cells had 47,XY, + 12,t(8;14)(q24;q32) chromosome complement, and 30% of the cells had a 47,XY, + 12,dup1q + (q22-31),t(8;14)(q24;q32). The consistent finding of the specific chromosome rearrangement (8/14 translocation) in all abnormal cells suggests that the cells were derived from a common precursor. With regard to the partial T cell marker expression, the significance of these markers in B cell leukemia is unclear, as is their relation to the additional chromosome abnormalities that apparently developed in the process of clonal evolution.
