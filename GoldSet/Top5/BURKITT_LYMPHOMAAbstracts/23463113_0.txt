Burkitt's lymphoma of the thyroid gland is a rare malignancy. We present a case of a 58-year-old female who developed a rapid enlargement of her thyroid gland. Core biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma. The tumour resolved after three cycles of chemotherapy. This case report emphasises the importance of considering lymphoma when dealing with thyroid nodules and goitres, as its management is different from that of other thyroid pathologies and delaying treatment has an impact on prognosis.
