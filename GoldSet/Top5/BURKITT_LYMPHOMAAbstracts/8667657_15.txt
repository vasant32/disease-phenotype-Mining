Despite its rarity by routine karyotypic analysis, cryptic t(12;21)(p12-13;q22) translocation leading to TEL/AML1 fusion has been recognized as the most frequent genetic rearrangement in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in two recent studies, one from France and the other from the United States. To estimate the frequency of this abnormality in the Chinese population, we studied 41 children with ALL and 17 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in two medical centers in Taiwan, using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Results of this analysis demonstrated a 17% frequency of this translocation in the ALL population overall and 19% in patients with B-lineage ALL, similar to previous findings in Caucasian children. None of the patients with AML had TEL/AML1 fusion transcripts. In addition to its association with the B-lineage immunophenotype, TEL/AML1 was also correlated with a low presenting leukocyte count and favorable age (1-10 years). These findings, combined with earlier reports, indicate that TEL/AML1 fusion is the most frequent genetic abnormality in childhood ALL, regardless of race. Molecular diagnosis of t(12;21)-positive ALL may identify a subgroup of patients who do not require intensive treatment for cure.
