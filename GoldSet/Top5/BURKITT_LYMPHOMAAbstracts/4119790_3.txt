A water-soluble component of membranes of cells from a Burkitt's lymphoma cultured cell line was used to develop an antiserum that detects an antigen(s) on acute leukemia cells. This antiserum did not react with nonlymphoid cultured cell lines except for human embryonic kidney cells infected with the Rauscher murine leukemia virus. Absorption studies demonstrated this antigen to be crossreactive with the antigen detected on the human acute leukemia cells.
