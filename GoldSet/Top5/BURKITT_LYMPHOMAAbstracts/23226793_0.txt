Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is a high-grade lymphoma which represents 8-10% of all tumors in individuals younger than 15 years old. It may occur as an abdominal tumor, which in rare cases may include gastric mucosa, although in most cases, the tumor is located in the ileum or cecum. Primary gastric lymphoma constitutes as low as 1.48% of all gastric cancers in children. In this study, we described a case of gastric BL in a 4-year-old child, presenting discontinuous abdominal pain, weight loss, constipation and irritability. Despite its rarity in children, this tumor should be treated aggressively and long-term survival has been reported.
