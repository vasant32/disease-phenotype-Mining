Expression of latent Epstein-Barr virus genomes in somatic-cell hybrids of Burkitt's lymphoblastoid cells has been studied. Treatment of the hybrid cells, D98/Raji and D98/HR-1, with IUDR induced the formation of EA and VCA and replication of virus DNA, whereas the same treatment of Raji cells induced only the formation of EA. The patterns of transcription of virus genomes in these three cell lines were, however, very similar: 25% without treatment with IUDR, 30% immediately after the treatment and 50% (entire genome transcription) three days after being transferred to fresh medium. The amount of virus RNA in the cells, calculated from DNA-RNA hybridization kinetics, was proportional to the number of virus genomes per cell, suggesting that every copy of virus DNA in these cells is actively transcribed.
