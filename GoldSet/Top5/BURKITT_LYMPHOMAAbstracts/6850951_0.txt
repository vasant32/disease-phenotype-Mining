Two cases of Burkitt's tumor treated in the Pediatric Hospital, Owendo, Libreville are discussed. The tumors were of the maxillofacial type, and remission by chemotherapy was obtained for a period of between 6 to 8 months. After this length of time, and in spite of spectacular local results, metastases developed and led to a fatal outcome. Cyclophosphamide chemotherapy is effective locally, but does not prevent recurrence.
