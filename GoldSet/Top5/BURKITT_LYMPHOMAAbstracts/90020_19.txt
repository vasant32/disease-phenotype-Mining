A cytogenetic study, including prophase-prometaphase chromosome analysis, of a patient with EBV-genome-negative acute lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell type with Burkitt-type cells is presented. All bone-marrow mitoses examined had a 14q+ marker chromosome which was identified as a reciprocal 8;14 translocation of exactly the same type as in Burkitt's lymphoma.
