In summer 1978, Burkitt lymphoma was diagnosed in a 23 year old Swiss male. A brief report on this patient appears justified for the following reasons: (1) Burkitt lymphoma is very rarely diagnosed in Switzerland. (2) The tumor cells of this patient could be established as a cell line. They have now been subpassaged in vitro for over 9 months. (3) In contrast to the majority of non-African Burkitt lymphomas, these tumor cells produce small amounts of Epstein-Barr virus.
