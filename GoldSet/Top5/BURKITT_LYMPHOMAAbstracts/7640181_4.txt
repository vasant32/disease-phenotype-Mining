From 1988 to 1992 160 children with clinically or pathologically proven Burkitt's lymphoma were seen and treated in Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. We present the epidemiologic features, the results of staging using ultrasonography, fine needle aspiration biopsy, and the different treatment regimens used. Lack of resources made it extremely difficult to provide the necessary high level of care for these children or to carry out a proper study in the management of this fascinating disease.
