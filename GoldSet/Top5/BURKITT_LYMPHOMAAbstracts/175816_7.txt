The cytolethal response to treatment with prednisolone was investigated in vitro in eight human lymphoblastoid cell lines containing varying concentrations of specific cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors. A similar response was observed in seven of the lines irrespective of their concentration of cytoplasmic receptors and pharmacological doses of steroid, well above those required to saturate receptors in cell-free extracts, were required for a massive lethal response. One cell line derived from Burkitt's lymphoma was refractory to lethal effects even with pharmacological doses of steroid. A similar unresponsiveness to the cytolethal effect of prednisolone in vitro was observed in fresh lymphoblasts derived from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia despite evidence of a satisfactory clinical response to therapy which included steroid. The resistance of human lymphoblastoid cells to treatment with glucocorticoids in vitro may result from a defect in activation subsequent to the binding of steroid to cytoplasmic receptors.
