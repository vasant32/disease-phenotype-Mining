Various mono- and multivalent cations, at constant ionic strength, affected the surface electrokinetic properties of normal human lymphoid and Burkitt lymphoma cells in a manner which reflected more the physicochemical properties and binding affinities of the cation than its valence. The effect was expressed in the changes of the magnitude of the net surface charge and in the shift of the isoelectric point of the surface. These changes were greater at the surface of Burkitt's lymphoma cells than at the surface of their normal cell-line counterparts.
