The possible molecular heterogeneity of human transferrin receptors was analyzed using two murine monoclonal antibodies, Tü15 and Tü67. Both reagents precipitated from lysates of 125I-labeled HL-60 cells a major component of 88 kDa which could be identified as the transferrin receptor by comparison with the proteins detected by monoclonal antibody OKT9. Although sequential immunoprecipitations appeared to demonstrate molecular heterogeneity of transferrin receptors, since the Tü15-reactive species were fully included in the Tü67-positive population, but not vice versa, the possible association of Tü15-reactive molecules with transferrin receptor is also discussed.
