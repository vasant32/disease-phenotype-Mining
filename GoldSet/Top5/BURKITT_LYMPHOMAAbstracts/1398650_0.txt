Benign lymphocytic angiitis and granulomatosis is a T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder confined to the lung and corresponding to a low-grade angiocentric immunoproliferative lesion. Controversy remains as to whether these lesions are lymphomas. We report such a case in an 8-year-old patient with Burkitt's lymphoma in remission who presented with persistent bronchopneumopathy and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on tomodensitometry. Surgical resection revealed the histologic changes of benign lymphocytic angiitis and granulomatosis. Immunohistochemistry showed no aberrant pan T-cell marker loss. Genetic analysis of frozen tissue by Southern blot DNA hybridization with probes to T-cell receptor beta- and gamma-chain genes and to the immunoglobulin heavy chain joining region gene (JH) identified no clonal rearrangement. Search for Epstein-Barr virus-DNA sequences by in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis provided negative results. Our data imply that lowgrade angiocentric immunoproliferative lesions are not exclusively lymphomas but might represent a borderline lymphoproliferative disease (seen in the course of many diseases), perhaps corresponding to host immune response.
