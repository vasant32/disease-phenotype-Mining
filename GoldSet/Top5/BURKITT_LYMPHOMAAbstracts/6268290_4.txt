A variant translocation t(8;22)(q23;q11) has been found in tumor cells from a 19-year-old white man with an Epstein-Barr virus-associated Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). The tumor, which appeared 2 years after the patient had infectious mononucleosis, bore histopathological features characteristic of BL, although only the lymph nodes in the cervical region were involved. This case and some other recent cytogenetic observations of nonendemic BL emphasize the importance of chromosome #8 rearrangement in this B-cell-type lymphoma.
