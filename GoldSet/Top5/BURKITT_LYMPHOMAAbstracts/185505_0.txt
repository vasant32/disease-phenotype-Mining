We report about a lymphoblastomic sarcoma of the Burkitt type with a seventeen year old young man. The Burkitt lymphoma occupies a special position among the malignant tumours and occurs rarely in temperate zones. From the clinical and histological point of view, we found the typical image of a unilocular Burkitt tumor. It was not possible to verify an elevated titre of antibodies against the Epstein-Barr virus.
