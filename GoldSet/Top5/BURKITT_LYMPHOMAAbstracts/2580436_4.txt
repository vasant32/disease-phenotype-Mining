A 30-year-old homosexual man presented with widespread Burkitt's lymphoma. On the basis of immunologic and viral studies, he was suspected of having the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Following chemotherapy that included intrathecal cytosine arabinoside and methotrexate, brain stem edema, paraplegia, and an elevated cerebrospinal fluid level of myelin basic protein developed. Autopsy revealed vacuolar demyelination of spinal cord, brain stem, and cerebellum. The pathologic findings were similar to those reported to occur in myelopathy associated with intrathecal chemotherapy, but far more extensive. The contribution of the suspected acquired immune deficiency syndrome is unknown.
