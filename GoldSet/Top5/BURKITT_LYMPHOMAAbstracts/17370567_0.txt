A 67 years old male otherwise healthy who had undergone surgery for nasal polyposis ten years earlier was recently diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. During induction treatment the patient developed sino-pulmonary aspergillosis caused byAspergillus flavus. The patient developed severe reactions against amphotericin- B and thereafter Abelcet, whereas he tolerated treatment with AmBisome. Surgery of the nasal cavities was performed whereas surgery of the pulmonary infiltrates was not possible. During subsequent treatment for his leukaemia and long periods of neutropenia, the patient was on AmBisome treatment and there were no signs of progression of the Aspergillus infection. The antifungal treatment was considered to be successful. The patient was referred back to his local hospital and antifungal treatment was switched to oral itraconazole.
