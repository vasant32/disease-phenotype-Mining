In a series of 31 patients with NHL presenting in the oral region, nine lesions were in the maxilla and 5 were in the mandible, for a total of 14 (45%) lesions that arose in bone. The most common locations were the posterior regions of the maxilla (7 cases) and mandible (4 cases). Diffuse subtypes clearly predominated, 13 out of 14 cases demonstrating this pattern. Six of the cases were in children, and 4 of these qualified as Burkitt's lymphoma. In general, it was found that the statistics relating to survival of patients with jawbone lymphoma correspond closely to the findings reported for skeletal lymphomas. Despite the high incidence of diffuse patterns, 6 of these 14 patients with NHL in bone were alive with no evidence of disease 3 years or longer.
