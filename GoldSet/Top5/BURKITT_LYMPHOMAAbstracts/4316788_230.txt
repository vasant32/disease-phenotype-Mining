Inoculation of 64-10 or Raji cultures with Epstein-Barr virus derived from the HRI-K clone of the P3J Burkitt's lymphoma line caused abortive infections in most of the lymphoblastoid cells with synthesis of "early antigens" but few, if any, capsids. Antibodies to early antigens were detected by indirect immunofluorescence in serums of many patients with infectious mononucleosis, Burkitt's lymphoma, or nasopharyngeal carcinoma. These antibodies were rarely present in other serums even though some of them showed high titers of antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus when assayed on EB3 Burkitt tumor cells; they also prevented synthesis of early antigens, provided the serums were mixed with the virus prior to inoculation. Antibodies to early antigens possibly reflect current or recent disease processes that are associated with the virus.
