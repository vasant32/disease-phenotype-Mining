Namalwa and Raji cells, originally obtained from a Burkitt tumor biopsy, grow as continuous cell lines in vitro and contain the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related nuclear antigen EBNA (B. M. Reedman and G. Klein, Int. J. Cancer 11:499-520, 1973) and RNA homologous to at least 17 and 30% of the EBV genome, respectively (S. D. Hayward and E. Kieff, J. Virol. 18:518-525, 1976; T. Orellana and E. Kieff, J. Virol. 22:321-330, 1977). The polyribosomal and polyadenylated [poly(A)+] RNA fractions of Namalwa and Raji cells are enriched for a class of viral RNA homologous to 5 to 7% of EBV DNA (Hayward and Kieff, J. Virol. 18:518-525, 1976; Orellana and Kieff, J. Virol. 22:321-330, 1977). The objective of the experiments described in this communication was to determine the location within the map of the EBV genome (D. Given and E. Kieff, J. Virol. 28:524-542, 1978) of the DNA which encodes the viral RNA in the poly(A)+ and non-polyadenylated [poly(A)-] RNA fractions of Namalwa cells. Hybridization of labeled DNA homologous to Namalwa poly(A)+ or poly(A)- RNA to blots containing EcoRI, Hsu I, or Hsu I/EcoRI double-cut fragments of EBV (B95-8) or (W91) DNA indicated that these RNAs are encoded by DNA contained primarily in the Hsu I A/EcoRI A and Hsu I B/EcoRI A fragments and, to a lesser extent, in other fragments of the EBV genome. Hybridizations of Namalwa poly(A)+ and poly(A)- RNA in solution to denatured labeled EcoRI A or B fragments, Hsu I A, B, or D fragments, and Hsu I A/EcoRI A or Bam I S fragments and of Raji polyribosomal poly(A)+ RNA to the EcoRI A fragment indicated that (i) Namalwa poly(A)+ RNA is encoded primarily by 6 x 10(5) daltons of a 2 x 10(6)-dalton segment of DNA, Bam I S, which is tandemly reiterated, approximately 10 times, in the Hsu I A/EcoRI A fragment and is encoded to a lesser extent by DNA in the Hsu I B, EcoRI B, and Hsu I D fragments. Raji polyribosomal poly(A)+ RNA is encoded by a similar fraction of the EcoRI A fragment as that which encodes Namalwa poly(A)+ RNA. (ii) The fraction of the Bam I S fragment homologous to Namalwa poly(A)- RNA is similar to the fraction homologous to Namalwa poly(A)+ RNA. However, Namalwa poly(A)- RNA is homologous to a larger fraction of the DNA in the Hsu I B, Hsu I D, and EcoRI B fragments.
