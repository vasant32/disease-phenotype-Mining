cDNA encoding a novel putative G-protein-coupled receptor, named LyGPR (lymphocyte derived G-protein-coupled receptor) was cloned using a reverse transcription-PCR approach. The LyGPR amino acid sequence is 375 residues long and shows similarity (about 30-35% identity) both to the angiotensin receptors and members of the chemokine receptor family. Northern blot analysis revealed a 3.1-kb LyGPR transcript expressed predominantly in lung, heart and lymphoid tissues. LyGPR expression was also detected in the pre-B acute lymphoblastoid leukemia cell lines Reh and Nalm-6, in the Burkitt's lymphoma line Daudi, and in hematopoietic progenitor cells from bone marrow, as well as in B cells, T cells and monocytes from peripheral blood.
