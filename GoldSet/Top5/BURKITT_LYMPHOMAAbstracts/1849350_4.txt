Serologic diagnosis for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is problematic when patients receive exogenous immunoglobulin. We recently diagnosed primary EBV infection by detecting EBV-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA) and EBV-DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques in a patient with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) who received prophylactic immunoglobulins for EBV infection. These combined techniques may be helpful for early and accurate diagnosis of EBV infection in highly vulnerable patients.
