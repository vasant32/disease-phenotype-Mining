A 2-year-7-month old boy, presented with painless bloody stool was initially found to have an ulcerative, wide-based polyp in the ascending colon near the ileocecal region by colonoscopy. He received operation due to subsequent intussusception. Pathologic examination revealed an unusual case of polypoid Burkitt's lymphoma. The patient lives well 20 months later after receiving a standard chemotherapy. This case reminds us that colonic polyp and intussusception which is caused by Burkitt's lymphoma should be included in the differential diagnosis for a "wide-based polypoid" mass in the ascending colon.
