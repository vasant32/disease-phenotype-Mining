 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: p53 status and CD38 antigen are biological factors influencing response to therapy and clinical course in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). This study tests the hypothesis that soluble p53 alone and in association with CD38 can enucleate B-CLL subsets at worse prognosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: Wild and mutant forms of p53 protein were evaluated in 197 B-CLL patients at diagnosis or before progression by an immunoenzymatic method in plasma using an anti-p53 monoclonal antibody. CD38 expression was analyzed by a multicolor flow cytometric assay. RESULTS: Higher levels of both soluble p53 (sp53) and CD38 were significantly correlated with intermediate and high Rai stages, with higher beta2-microglobulin and soluble CD23 values, determined at diagnosis. Shorter overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were both observed in sp53+ and CD38+ patients (p<0.0001). Simultaneous positivity or negativity for sp53 and CD38 identified two subsets of patients, the former with a worse prognosis and the latter with a better prognosis with regard to PFS (p<0.0001) and OS (p<0.0001). The predictive value of sp53 and CD38 was retained among the patients within the intermediate Rai risk group. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: sp53 and CD38 together with ZAP-70 were confirmed to be independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. With regard to PFS, ZAP-70, sp53 and CD38 were confirmed to be independent prognostic factors. Concerning OS, ZAP-70, CD38 and age (< or > 60 years) were independent prognostic factors whereas sp53 showed only a tendency towards statistical significance.
