The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome-negative Burkitt's lymphoma-derived cell lines BJAB and Ramos and their in vitro EBV-converted sublines BJAB-B1, BJAB-A5, BJAB-B95-8, and AW-Ramos were infected with high multiplicities of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1; 10 to 70 PFU/cell). Cultures were monitored for cell growth and HSV-1 DNA synthesis. EBV-converted BJAB cultures were more permissive for HSV-1 infection than BJAB cultures. Significant cell killing and HSV-1 DNA synthesis were observed during the first 48 h of infection in the EBV-converted BJAB cultures but not in the BJAB cultures. The EBV-converted BJAB-B1 cell line contains an appreciable fraction of EBV-negative cells. Therefore, it was cloned. EBV-positive and -negative cells were identified by using EBV-determined nuclear antigen anti-complement immunofluorescence. Two types of subclones were identified: (i) those which contained both EBV-determined nuclear antigen-positive and -negative cells and (ii) those which contained only EBV-determined nuclear antigen-negative cells. When levels of HSV-1 DNA synthesis were measured in these subclones, it was found that the former were more permissive for HSV-1 infection than the latter. Thus, the presence of the EBV genome in BJAB cells correlates with increased permissiveness of these cells for HSV-1 during the first 48 h of infection. Nonetheless, persistent HSV-1 infections were established in both BJAB and EBV-converted BJAB-B1 cultures. No differences in extent of permissiveness for HSV-1 infection were found for Ramos and EBV-converted AW-Ramos cells.
