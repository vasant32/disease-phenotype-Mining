Epstein-Barr virus superinfection of the human lymphoblastoid cell line Raji, a Burkitt lymphoma-derived line that contains Epstein-Barr virus genomes in an episomal form, results in the sequential synthesis of 29 detectable proteins, which range in molecular weight from approximately 155,000 to 21,000, and in the shutoff of the bulk of host protein synthesis within 6 to 9 h after infection. There are three classes of virus-induced proteins; these are an early class, consisting of eight proteins synthesized by 6 h postinfection, an intermediate class, containing two proteins synthesized 9 h postinfection, and a late class, consisting of five proteins synthesized 12 h postinfection. In addition, there is a fourth class of polypeptides, called persistent, that are found both before and after superinfection. The rates of synthesis of the proteins fall into three patterns; these are pattern A, in which the rate of synthesis decreases, pattern B, in which the rate of synthesis remains steady, and pattern C, in which the rate of synthesis increases after the initial appearance of the polypeptide. Both 9-(2-hydroxy-ethoxymethyl)guanine (acyclovir) and phosphonoacetic acid inhibit the appearance of one intermediate protein and at least three late proteins. Seven polypeptides are phosphorylated at different times after infection.
