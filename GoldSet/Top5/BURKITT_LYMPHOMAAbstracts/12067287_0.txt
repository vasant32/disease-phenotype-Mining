A 9-year-old-boy with severe haemophilia A (factor VIII < 1%) developed colicky abdominal pain with swelling in the left iliac fossa for 4 weeks. His LDH level was 1423 IU/l (normal range < 220 IU/l) and his uric acid, 6.8 mg/dl. A computerised tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen demonstrated a tumour of the terminal ileum and mild hepatosplenomegaly. Pre-operative screening for factor VIII inhibitor was negative. Post-operatively, the patient needed high doses of factor VIII to maintain haemostasis. The tumour was found to be a high-grade lymphoma of Burkitt's type. He recovered from his operation and chemotherapy was commenced. Investigations demonstrated an anti-von Willebrand factor (VWF) antibody. He subsequently relapsed and died of progressive disease. Development of anti-VWF antibody in lymphoma is well known, but development of this antibody in a haemophilia A patient developing lymphoma has not been reported. The present case shows that antibody to VWF should be considered as a possible reason for an increased factor VIII requirement in such patients.
