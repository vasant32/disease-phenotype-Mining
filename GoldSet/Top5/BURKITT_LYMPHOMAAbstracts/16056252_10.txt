Heat-shock protein-90 (HSP90) inhibitors are currently being used in phase I clinical trials for treating patients with a variety of neoplasms including lymphomas. Using immunohistochemical methods, we assessed for HSP90 expression in 412 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In B-cell lymphomas, HSP90 was moderately to strongly expressed in all cases of Burkitt's lymphoma (5/5, 100%), and in subsets of follicular lymphoma (17/28, 61%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (27/46, 59%), nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (6/16, 38%), plasma cell neoplasms (14/39, 36%), small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (3/9, 33%), mantle cell lymphoma (12/38, 32%) and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (3/10, 30%). HSP90 was weakly expressed in six of 14 (43%) cases of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. In T-cell lymphomas, HSP90 was moderately to strongly expressed in subsets of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (14/24, 58%; 9/12 ALK+ and 5/12 ALK-), precursor-T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (20/65, 31%), unspecified peripheral T-cell lymphoma (8/43, 23%) and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (2/17, 12%). HSP90 was weakly expressed in seven of 58 (12%) cases of mycosis fungoides. We conclude that HSP90 is commonly expressed in a subset of many types of B- and T-cell lymphoma. These data suggest that many lymphoma types are suitable targets for modulation of HSP90 activity, and that HSP90 inhibitors are a potential investigational therapy for lymphoma patients.
