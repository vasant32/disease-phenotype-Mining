Elevated plasma concentrations of endogenous thrombin generation markers and thrombotic events have been reported in children with leukemia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of cancer and its treatment on thrombin generation (TAT levels) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The authors evaluated 32 children (23 M, 9 F) aged between 1 and 15 years (mean 6) affected by ALL (immunophenotypic subgroups: 16 common, 7 T, and 9 pre-B type). In all patients TAT levels at onset and after 5-6 doses of L-asparaginase were evaluated. TAT levels were higher in patients both at onset (13.04 +/- 10.90 ng/L) and after the 5-6 doses of L-asp (19.41 +/- 11.05 ng/L) with respect to controls (4 +/- 1 ng/L) (p < .001 and p < .001). TAT levels after 5-6 doses of L-asp were higher than those at onset (p < .001). Factorial ANOVA showed that at onset there was a significant effect of leukemia immunophenotypic subgroups upon TAT levels (p < .05) and no effect of inherited thrombotic risk factors. These results indicate that in children with ALL an important role is played by acquired thrombotic risk factors, among which the indirect cancer procoagulant activity has its importance.
