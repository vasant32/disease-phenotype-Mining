Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with both benign and malignant lymphoproliferative processes. Recently, mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) have been described that develop EBV-induced lymphomas when inoculated with peripheral blood lymphocytes from EBV-seropositive individuals. To investigate the pathogenesis of EBV-associated Burkitt lymphomas, we intraperitoneally inoculated SCID mice with cells from EBV-infected Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cell lines. In general, cells from BL lines developed into BL-like tumors. Certain BL cell lines, however, were not particularly tumorigenic in these animals. Antibody capable of depleting mice of natural killer cells (anti-asialo GM1) favored the development of these Burkitt lymphomas. The pathogenetic implications of this animal model for human disease is discussed.
