A retrospective review of patients treated for endemic Burkitt's lymphoma in Ghana was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of intrathecal (IT) chemoprophylaxis in preventing central nervous system (CNS) relapse. Patients treated before 1974 received no IT chemoprophylaxis and those treated between 1974 and 1979 received IT methotrexate in addition to systemic chemotherapy. In patients presenting with facial disease only (Stages I-II), there was no significant difference in the frequency of CNS relapse between those receiving IT chemoprophylaxis and those not receiving any. CNS relapse was, however, significantly reduced in patients presenting with abdominal disease (Stage III) who received IT chemoprophylaxis in addition to systemic combination therapy. This was associated with an improved survival.
