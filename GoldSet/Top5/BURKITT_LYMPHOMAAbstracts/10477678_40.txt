Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) genome has been detected in several human lymphoproliferative disorders with no signs of active viral infection, and found to be integrated into chromosomes in some cases. We previously reported a woman with HHV-6-infected Burkitt's lymphoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the viral genome was integrated into the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q13). The patient's asymptomatic husband also carried HHV-6 DNA integrated at chromosome locus 1q44. To assess the possibility of chromosomal transmission of HHV-6 DNA, we looked for HHV-6 DNA in the peripheral blood of their daughter. She had HHV-6 DNA on both chromosomes 22q13 and 1q44, identical to the site of viral integration of her mother and father, respectively. The findings suggested that her viral genomes were inherited chromosomally from both parents. The 3 family members were all seropositive for HHV-6, but showed no serological signs of active infection. To confirm the presence of HHV-6 DNA sequences, we performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 7 distinct primer pairs that target different regions of HHV-6. The viral sequences were consistently detected by single-step PCR in all 3 family members. We propose a novel latent form for HHV-6, in which integrated viral genome can be chromosomally transmitted. The possible role of the chromosomally integrated HHV-6 in the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferative diseases remains to be explained.
