We have assessed the effectiveness of the metalloproteinase inhibitor BB-94 (batimastat) in reducing the colonization potential of the human Burkitt lymphoma Namalwa cell line. In this study Namalwa cells were injected intraperitoneally into SCID mice and their spread to the spleen, liver and lung studied over a 3 week period. The human cells were detected in the mouse tissues by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a human alu repeat sequence. Comparison of BB-94-treated animals with an untreated control group provided no evidence for a significant reduction in the colonization of mouse tissues by the human lymphoma cells in the presence of the drug. Tumour growth, after subcutaneous injection of the Namalwa cells into SCID mice, was similarly unaffected by BB-94. The significance of these results is discussed.
