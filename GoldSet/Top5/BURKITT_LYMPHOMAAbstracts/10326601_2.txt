HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 40-year-old man was admitted with acute onset of positional vertigo, nausea and vomiting. Neurological examination revealed a fatigable nystagmus to the upward ear in positional testing, to the right more than to the left, as well as latent paresis and rigidity of the left arm. INVESTIGATIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed two space-occupying lesions in the cerebellum and pons. Open biopsy showed a highly malignant B-cell lymphoma of Burkitt type. There was no evidence of acquired or congenital immunodeficiency. As there were no significant abnormalities outside of the CNS, a primary lymphoma in this location was diagnosed. TREATMENT AND COURSE: Chemotherapy with a combination of drugs including methotrexate achieved only partial remission. Subsequent radiotherapy brought about full remission, which has now lasted for over a year. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of first choice of a primary cerebral lymphoma in an immunocompetent patient is chemotherapy with cerebrospinal fluid-permeable cytostatics. Partial remission should be followed by radiotherapy.
