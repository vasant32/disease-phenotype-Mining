Apoptosis or programmed cell death is essential in the process of controlling lymphocyte growth and selection. We identified RNA polymerase B transcription factor 3 (BTF3), which is associated with anti-IgM antibody-mediated apoptosis, using a subclone of the human Burkitt lymphoma cell line BL60. To identify the transcription factor BTF3, which is expressed only in minor amounts, we used preparative high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) employing carrier ampholytes for isoelectric focusing. Comparison of the 2DE protein patterns from apoptotic and nonapoptotic cells showed BTF3 as a predominantly altered protein spot. The characterization of the differentially expressed transcription factor and 13 marker proteins described in this study were performed by internal Edman microsequencing and/or by peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The proteome analysis was significantly improved by performing the newly developed preparative high-resolution two-dimensional gels employing high protein concentrations.
