A clinically advanced stage of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) occurring unusually in a middle-aged perimenopausal woman in an endemic area is reported. Successful treatment was achieved by tumour debulking and intensive pulsed combination chemotherapy. BL needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal swellings in adults in endemic areas.
