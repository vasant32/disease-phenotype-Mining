BACKGROUND: Advanced Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) has an extremely poor prognosis in adults. With a previous protocol including CNS prophylaxis, 40% of our adult patients achieved CR and only 13% became long survivors. In 1988, following this poor experience, we adopted a very intensive pediatric-derived protocol. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one consecutive patients, 8 adults (median age 35, stage III: 1; IV: 7; leukemias: 6) and 13 children (median age 10, state III: 8; IV: 5; leukemias: 4) were treated with the same protocol (POG 8617), based on alternate two-phase cycles with sequential high-dose CTX, VCR, ADM + CNS chemoprophylaxis (phase A) and HD MTX + HiDAC (phase B). Adults received 6 cycles, children 8; i.t. prophylaxis in phase B was omitted in adults. RESULTS: Twenty of 21 (95%) patients achieved CR (adults 100%, children 92%). Two patients died early; 2 relapsed at 4 and 9 months. With a median follow-up of 28 months (4-96), 17 patients (81%) are event free (adults 75%, children 85%). Severe infections affected 62% of adults and 15% of children. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The prognosis of adult advanced BL definitely improved with this intensive protocol. (2) There were no differences in outcome between adults and children. (3) Outcome of lymphoma and leukemia was similar. (4) Severe infections occurred frequently in adults. This intensive pediatric protocol requires a careful supportive therapy.
