A review of 110 children with Burkitt's lymphoma admitted to the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu during a 7-year period revealed a preponderance of males over females (1.9:1) and a peak incidence at five years. The main sites affected initially by the tumour in order of frequency were the face and abdomen. The spinal column, spleen, and lungs were less affected. It is postulated that an interaction between malarial and Epstein-Barr virus infections and malnutrition are important in the aetiology of the tumour. The most effective drug is cyclophosphamide. A combination of this drug with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective in inducing remissions, but is better than the single agent in preventing systemic relapse. Follow-up of the patients revealed good survival.
