Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) DNA is nearly always detectable in African Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) but is infrequently found in the histologically indistinguishable American BL. We have derived a tumor cell line from a patient with American BL which produces EBV, and we have compared this virus isolate [JLP(c)] with African BL EBV. The American JLP(c) virus immortalizes human umbilical cord lymphocytes in vitro, and its DNA is indistinguishable from African BL EBV DNA by nucleic acid hybridization and preliminary restriction endonuclease cleavage analysis.
