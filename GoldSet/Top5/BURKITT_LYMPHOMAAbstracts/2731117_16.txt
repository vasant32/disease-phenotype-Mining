The clinical relevance of a morphologic distinction between Burkitt's (B) and non-Burkitt's (NB) types of small non-cleaved cell (SNC) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has been controversial. Numerous attempts to discern an important clinical difference between the subtypes have failed to provide a convincing reason to maintain this distinction for other than descriptive purposes. Because of conflicting reports in the literature, the authors have analyzed 183 cases of SNC NHL in children from the Pediatric Oncology Group and 129 from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, TN). The results from both series, which consist of approximately the same proportions of B and NB subtypes, (i.e., approximately 54%-58% B, 36% NB, and 6%-10% not otherwise specified) show no significant differences in age at presentation, extent of disease, primary site of involvement, or survival. The authors conclude that the morphologic distinction between B and NB types of SNC NHL in children lacks demonstrable clinical importance.
