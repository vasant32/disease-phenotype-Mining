OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of human herpesvirus 6(HHV-6) on the replication of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in cell lines. METHODS: Both EBV-infected Raji cells and EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) were infected with HHV-6. Immunofluoresence assay (IFA) with monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against HHV-6 was applied to confirm the infection of HHV-6 in the two cell lines. Expression of EBV antigen was examined by IFA using human anti-EBV serum. RESULTS: Following HHV-6 infection, cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed in Raji cells but not in LCL. HHV-6 were detected in both cell lines by IFA with anti-HHV-6 MAb, but not in controls. EBV antigens were detected by IFA with human serum against EBV in both HHV-6 infected cell lines. CONCLUSION: Data in this study suggest that HHV-6 promotes the expression of EBV antigen and may contribute to the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in cooperation with EBV.
