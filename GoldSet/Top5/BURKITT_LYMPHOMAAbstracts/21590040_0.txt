A 193 base pair repeat polymorphism in the human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PADPRP) pseudogene found on chromosome 13 has been associated with lung cancer, endemic Burkitt lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma, breast cancer and colorectal carcinoma. We investigated the frequency of the PADPRP genetic polymorphism in a hospital-based case-control study of lung cancer for 54 cases and 47 controls. There was a statistically significant difference in allelic frequency between Caucasians and African Americans (p<0.001). For African Americans, the odds ratio for lung cancer and the 'B' allele was 2.38 (95% C.I.=0.73, 7.69) and for Caucasians 0.44 (95% C.I.=0.11, 1.77). The results for the African Americans, however, were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, although the Caucasians were. Thus, this study, albeit small, does not find that the PADPRP pseudogene duplicated region located on chromosome 13 is a risk factor for lung cancer.
