BCL-6 codes for a transcription factor implicated in chromosomal translocations of diffuse large cell lymphomas. Recent evidence indicates that BCL-6 may also be altered by mutations of its 5' non-coding regions. In this study we have investigated the distribution of BCL-6 5' mutations among 35 Burkitt's lymphoma cases representative of the epidemiologic variants of the disease. Mutations were detected in 6/21 (28.6%) sporadic Burkitt's lymphomas and 7/14 (50%) endemic Burkitt's lymphomas. These data expand the spectrum of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas associated with BCL-6 5' mutations and have implications for the pathogenesis, histogenesis and clinical monitoring of Burkitt's lymphoma.
