A 34-year-old German woman who had never been to Africa developed a Burkitt lymphoma of African type during the fifth month of pregnancy. The diagnosis was confirmed during life by cytological and virological tests. There was a markedly increased antibody titre against the Epstein-Barr virus in serum as well as virus antigen in the tumour tissue. There was extensive involvement of almost all abdominal organs and of the breast. After spontaneous abortion of a female foetus in the sixth month of pregnancy cytostatic treatment was started, but without achieving remission. The patient died five weeks after admission to hospital; the autopsy confirmed the clinical findings.
