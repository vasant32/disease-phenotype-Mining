A somatic cell hybrid between two human Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, Raji and Daudi, was infected with either Epstein-Barr virus or vesicular stomatitis virus after interferon treatment. Raji cells are resistant to the antiviral effects of exogenously added interferon, whereas Daudi cells are interferon sensitive. The Raji-Daudi hybrid showed an interferon sensitivity that was intermediary to that of the parental cells against both viruses.
