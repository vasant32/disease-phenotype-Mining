This study was aimed to explore the effects of histone deacetylase inhibitor chidamide on the proliferation, apoptosis of B lymphoma cell lines Raji (Burkitt lymphoma), Maver and Z-138 (mantle cell lymphoma) and its mechanisms. Three B lymphoma cell lines were cultured in vitro with different concentrations of chidamide for different time. The cell proliferation was determined by CCK-8 method; the cell apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential were analyzed by flow cytometry; the protein levels of histone H3/H4 acetylation in cells and the activity of caspase-3 were detected by Western blot. The results showed that chidamide inhibited the proliferation of 3 B lymphoma cell lines in time- and concentration-dependent manners, especially in Z-138 cell line earlier and faster; chidamide could induce cell apoptosis and decline of mitochondrial membrane potential, which was more sensitive in Maver and Z-138 cells than that in Raji cells. Chidamide could elevate the histone H3/H4 acetylation level in 3 B lymphoma cell lines and the activity of caspase-3 in Maver and Z-138 cells. It is concluded that chidamide can inhibit proliferation of B lymphoma cell lines and promote cell apoptosis, the increase of histone H3/H4 acetylation induced by chidamide, triggering of mitochondrial pathway and activation of caspase-3 may be considered as possible mechanisms.
