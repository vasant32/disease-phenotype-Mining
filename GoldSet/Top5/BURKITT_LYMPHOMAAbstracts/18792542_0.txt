Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis (MRH) is a rare disease of unknown etiology characterized by cutaneous nodules and destructive, sometimes crippling, polyarthritis. The diagnosis is confirmed by histopathologic features of the cutaneous nodules or synovial tissue, including an infiltrate composed of histiocytes, many of them multinucleate, with a ground glass appearance. Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis has been associated with a number of chronic conditions and various malignancies. We report a case of MRH in a patient with Burkitt lymphoma and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract.
