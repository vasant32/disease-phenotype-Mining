Heteroantisera were raised in rabbits against human thymocytes or Burkitt's lymphoma EBI cells. After suitable absorption, the sera were specific for thymocytes and T lymphoblasts, or B lymphoblasts and several lymphoblastoid cell lines. The specificity of the antisera was confirmed by preparing purified populations of T or B lymphocytes on immunoabsorbent columns, followed by mitogenic stimulation with phytohemagglutinin. The antisera did not react with normal resting lymphocytes.
