A very short, intensive paediatric chemotherapy programme was tested in a consecutive monoinstitutional group of 22 adult Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) patients. After a 5-week induction phase of weekly infusions consisting of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, high-dose (HD) methotrexate (MTX) plus leukovorin rescue, and intrathecal MTX or cytarabine (ARA-C), a consolidation phase including HD ARA-C plus cisplatin was given. Responding patients achieving less than complete response (CR) after completion of the initial induction phase, were promptly shifted to a high-dose, stem cell supported sequential chemotherapy schema (R-HDS). Patient characteristics: median age, 35.5 (range 18-76) years; Ann Arbor stage I-II/III-IV, 11/11; bulky disease, 15 patients; LDH > or = 460 U/l, 11 patients. The median duration of the chemotherapy programme was 62 d (range, 43-94 d). Seventeen patients achieved a CR (77%), one patient died of progressive disease and four partial responders following induction were converted to CR following R-HDS. Of 17 patients in CR, one died of infectious toxicity while in CR, and one relapsed at 30 months and died of progressive disease. After a median follow-up of 28.7 months (range, 6-158 months), 16 patients (73%) were in continued CR. Overall survival and progression-free survival were 77% [95% confidence interval (CI), 52-99%] and 68% (95% CI, 43-99%) respectively. Confirmation of these excellent efficacy and feasibility results by larger, multicentre and prospective studies is warranted.
