BACKGROUND: Natural killer cells display spontaneous, non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity against tumour cells, which is strongly enhanced after incubation with IL-2. The molecular background of the increased anti-tumour activity of these lymphokine-activated killer cells is still only partly understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this paper, investigation has been made of the correlation between cell surface glycosylation and anti-tumour activity of LAK cells by stimulating peripheral blood lymphocytes with interleukin-2, in the presence of inhibitors of N- and O-glycosylation. RESULTS: Inhibition of N- or O-glycosylation of proteins during IL-2 activation leads to a 70-80% decrease in the cytolytic activity of LAK cells against K562 and Daudi tumour cells, coinciding with drastic alterations in their cell surface carbohydrate profile. CONCLUSION: The conclusion is drawn that there is a clear correlation between the glycosylation of LAK cell glycoproteins and their anti-tumour activity which points to the involvement of cell surface glycoconjugates in the development of LAK activity.
