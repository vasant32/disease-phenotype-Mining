The effect of an amino acid analogue, L-canavanine, on the synthesis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens was investigated in lymphoblastoid cells. The analysis revealed that after infection of BJAB and NC-37 cells with P3HR-I EBV synthesis of early antigen (EA) was not affected by canavanine in concentrations up to 8.4 mM. The synthesis of EBV-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA) and of viral capsid antigen (VCA) was significantly inhibited at concentrations higher than 2.8 mM. Spontaneous induction of EA in P3HR-I cells was not affected by canavanine. On the other hand, EA induction by the tumor promoter TPA resulted in some viral antigen induction depending on the time period of TPA exposure. Pretreatment of the cells overnight with canavanine followed by washing and addition of the tumor promoter did not suppress EA induction by TPA. These data support the concept that EA induction by superinfection follows a different pathway from antigen induction by chemical inducers.
