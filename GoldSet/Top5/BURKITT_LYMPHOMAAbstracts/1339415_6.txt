Mutation of the c-myc gene locus has occurred during in vitro culture of the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Namalwa. Gene cloning and sequencing of this c-myc gene locus has revealed the insertion of incomplete copies of the Squirrel Monkey Retrovirus-Human (SMRV-H) proviral genome. Insertions of the SMRV-H genome were seen in all Namalwa cell lines tested, with multiple insertions being seen in some sublines. Viral particles with the morphology of type-D retrovirus, budding from these cells, were seen by transmission EM. New insertions of the genome were produced spontaneously in these cells. The origins of the type-D retrovirus and its implications for workers in the field are discussed.
