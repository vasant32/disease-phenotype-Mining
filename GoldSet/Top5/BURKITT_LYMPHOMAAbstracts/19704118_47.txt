Approximately 5% to 10% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) harbor an MYC oncogene rearrangement (MYC+). The prognostic significance of MYC+ DLBCL was determined in an unselected population of patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL treated with rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy (R-CHOP). Using a Vysis break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization probe, 12 of 135 (8.8%) cases of MYC+ DLBCL were identified that had no defining high-risk features. MYC+ DLBCL was associated with an inferior 5-year progression-free survival (66% vs 31%, P = .006) and overall survival (72% vs 33%, P = .016). Multivariate analysis confirmed the prognostic importance of MYC for both progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 3.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-7.21, P = .003) and overall survival (hazard ratio = 2.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-6.95, P = .011). Cases of MYC+ DLBCL also had a higher risk of central nervous system relapse (P = .023), independent of other risk factors. The diagnosis of MYC+ DLBCL is likely underappreciated; and given the lack of defining risk factors, fluorescence in situ hybridization for MYC rearrangements should be performed in all patients with DLBCL. In the R-CHOP treatment era, MYC+ DLBCLs have an inferior prognosis. Treatment regimens similar to those used in Burkitt lymphoma may be more appropriate in this patient population and need to be prospectively tested.
