 BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Embryonic development associated gene 1 (EDAG-1), located at chromosome 9q22, is specially expressed in hematopoietic cells, and related to the regulation of hematopoietic system. This study was designed to explore relationship between pathogenesis of leukemia, lymphoma and EDAG-1 through analyzing the structure of EDAG-1 coding region, and its expression in these cell lines. METHODS: Fifteen leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, HEL, K562, HL-60, Namalwa, Raji, J111, Jurkat, HuT 78, MEG-01, U937, 6T-CEM, HPB-ALL, KG-1a, THP-1, and DAMI, were selected to observe the expression of EDAG-1 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), EDAG-1 cDNA coding fragments (1.5 kb) were purified to construct the corresponding recombinant plasmid. Then, the plasmid was sequenced to analyze mutation of the coding region. The expression of EDAG-1 protein, and mRNA in these cell lines were detected by Western blot, and Northern blot; the rearrangement and amplification of EDAG-1 genome in these cell lines were detected by Southern blot. RESULTS: EDAG-1 mRNA and protein were highly expressed in erythroleukemia cell lines (K-562, HEL), megakaryoblast leukemia cell lines (DAMI, MEG-01), and T cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat), while no gene mutation was found in coding region, no amplification and rearrangement of genome was detected in these cell lines. EDAG-1 was absent in HL-60 cell line, and rearranged in HuT 78 cells. CONCLUSION: EDAG-1 may relate with pathogenesis of erythroleukemia and megakaryoblast leukemia; its coding region may have no relation with the mechanism of its activation.
