The radiation response of cultured Burkitt lymphoma cell, known as a particular cell line of high radiosensitivity, was studied by the colony formation method. The values of n, Dq, and Do derived from the survival curve after a single dose X-irradiation resulted in small values as 1.1, 10 rad, and 125 rad. The maximum recovery of about 5% was observed 3 hr after the irradiation by a split-dose experiment. In the survival curve derived from a split-dose irradiation, n and Dq increased while Do remained unchanged. The reason for these increases in n and Dq may be attributed to the nonhomogeneous or mixed population response.
