We present a patient with deletion of IgH associated with the reciprocal translocation (8;14) in Burkitt lymphoma. The patient had treatment resistant disease and died 10 weeks after diagnosis. The deletion was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization at diagnosis and again after failure of chemotherapy. To our knowledge this is the first report of such a deletion.
