We report on a 24-year-old man who had symptoms suggestive of acute pancreatitis but the diagnosis was Burkitt's lymphoma infiltrating the prostate. He was treated with cytotoxic drugs with a good initial response. Voiding improved and the tumor had disappeared completely on rectal palpation. However, the patient suffered a relapse and, despite intensive chemotherapy, he died a few months later with disseminated tumor infiltration.
