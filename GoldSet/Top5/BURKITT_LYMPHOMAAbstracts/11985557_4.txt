Burkitt's lymphoma is a rare aggressive lymphoma, which responds poorly to standard chemotherapy regimens used to treat high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The use of intensive chemotherapy protocols using alkylating agents and intensive CNS prophylaxis has dramatically altered prognosis. We have treated eight patients with Burkitt's lymphoma with a modified BFM protocol. The dose of methotrexate was reduced from 5 g/m2 to 1.5 g/m2 with the aim of reducing toxicity. Seven patients received a total of six cycles of chemotherapy each and one patient received five cycles of chemotherapy. Each cycle included high-dose methotrexate, an alkylating agent (ifosphamide or cyclophosphamide) and two triple intrathecal injections of chemotherapy. Two patients with bulky abdominal disease in addition received an autologous stem cell transplant. The regimen was well tolerated with minimal toxicity. At a median follow-up of 16 months (range 10-28), six of the eight patients (75%) were alive and in complete remission. Two patients relapsed, one 24 months post-BFM chemotherapy and the other 1-month post-autologous stem cell transplantation and 2 months post-BFM chemotherapy.
