Immunization of BALB/c mice with EBV-CLL-1 cells, derived from Epstein-Barr virus transformed B lymphocytes from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient, yielded 2 monoclonal antibodies (IgG1 Kappa and IgG2a Kappa) against a membrane antigen on a subset of normal B lymphocytes and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Immunofluorescence revealed strong reactivity of the antibodies with EBV-CLL-1 cells and with most lymphocytes in tonsil follicles, in the intestinal wall, around splenic arterioles and near Hassall's corpuscles in the neonatal thymus as well as with a small proportion of lymphocytes in some large reactive lymph node follicles, weak reactivity with 1/5 of peripheral blood B lymphocytes (PBL), and no reactivity with platelets, granulocytes and non-lymphoid tissues. PBL from 3 CLL patients showed weak staining of only larger cells. Intense fluorescence was observed in several non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of various histological types and in Burkitt's lymphoma lines but not in the 3 T lymphoblastoid and 12 nonlymphoid tumor lines examined. The antibodies precipitated Mr 22,000 and 33,000 bands from surface labeled RAJI or EBV-CLL-1 cells and cross-competed in a binding inhibition assay. The antibodies had approximately 6 million binding sites per EBV-CLL-1 or RAJI cell but were not cytotoxic. This high antigen-density and limited expression in normal cells may permit their use for immunocytological diagnosis and targeting cytotoxic agents and radionuclides against appropriate lymphoma cells.
