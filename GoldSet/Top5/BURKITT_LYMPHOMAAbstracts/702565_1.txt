The clinical features and treatment of 39 cases of fibrous epulis are described. Many of the epulides attained giant sizes before patients sought treatment. A few large or recurrent fibrous epulides were mistaken for malignant lesions, such as fibrosarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, or squamous cell carcinoma. Adequate excision and histological examination of all tissues excised were found to be the best management procedure for fibrous epulis.
