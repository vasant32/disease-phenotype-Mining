We have used YAC (yeast artificial chromosome) technology to create large translocation regions where the c-myc proto-oncogene is coupled to the core region of the human immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus (from VH2-5 through to Cdelta). Chimeric mice were obtained from embryonic stem cells carrying a single copy of the 240-kb IgH/c-myc translocation region. B-cell tumorigenesis occurs in the translocus mice, even when the entire Emu intron enhancer region between the joining segments and switch mu is deleted. This demonstrates that as yet unidentified regulatory elements in the IgH locus, independent from the known enhancers, are sufficient to cause B-cell specific activation of c-myc after translocation. The phenotype of tumors from IgH/c-myc YAC transgenic mice with or without Emu (B220+, IgM+/IgD+) is reminiscent of Burkitt's lymphoma. A rapidly expanding abnormal B-cell population is present at birth and accumulates in bone marrow, periphery, and spleen, well before discrete tumor establishment. Molecular analysis identified a clonal origin, with rearrangement of one mouse heavy chain allele retained in tumor cells from different sites, whereas subsequent rearrangements of heavy or light chain loci can be diverse. These mice routinely develop mature B-cell tumors early in life and may provide an invaluable resource of a B-cell lymphoma model.
