BACKGROUND: Leukapheresis for peripheral blood stem cell collection is increasingly being carried out in pediatric cancer patients. Aim of this study was to report experience of the Padua Apheresis Unit on a series of children weighting < 15 kg who have undergone such an apheresis procedure. METHODS: This retrospective study includes 15 pediatric patients affected with various malignancies (neuroblastoma: 7; acute myelogenous leukemia: 3; rhabdomyosarcoma: 2; PNET: 1; retinoblastoma: 1; Burkitt's lymphoma: 1) collecting peripheral blood stem cells by a Cobe Spectra blood cell separator. Main procedure parameters, including vascular access, leukapheresis duration, blood flow rate, processed blood volumes, side effects, mononuclear and CD34+ cell yields, have been registered. RESULTS: Altogether 22 sessions have been carried out, by processing a mean of 2.8 blood volumes. No leukapheresis related complications have been recorded, such as hypotension, hypocalcemia and hypothermia. Noteworthy, in 4 procedures two or more peripheral venipunctures have been performed to ensure an adequate blood flow. CONCLUSIONS: Leukapheresis for peripheral blood stem cell collection can be safely and efficaciously carried out in pediatric patients, even weighing < 15 kg, on the condition that certain aspects of apheresis practice in children (vascular access, volume shifts, anticoagulation, side effects) are carefully considered.
