Transforming growth factor alpha is a polypeptide growth factor that participates in the reversible transformation of cells in vitro and is secreted by many transformed cell lines. It also shares sequence and functional homologies with epidermal growth factor. Working with a cloned cDNA probe (lambda hTGF1-10) and derivatives, we have mapped this gene (TGFA) to 2p13 with the use of somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization. This is the same region involved in the 2;8 translocations of Burkitt lymphoma. Such a rearrangement could orient c-myc (8q24) adjacent to TGFA, resulting in activation of one or both of these genes.
