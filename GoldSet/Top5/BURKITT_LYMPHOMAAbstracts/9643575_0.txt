We describe a case of spontaneous splenic rupture occurred in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia of Burkitt type before starting cytotoxic chemotherapy. Left hypochondrial pain radiating to the homolateral shoulder was the only clinical symptom. Emergency computed tomography showed splenic laceration and hemoperitoneum. The patient underwent immediate laparatomy with splenectomy and experienced an uneventful postoperative recovery. Eight days after surgery, chemotherapy could be administered and complete remission was achieved. Although spontaneous rupture of the spleen is rare in leukemia and related disorders, this diagnosis should be taken in account also when clinical symptoms are mild. Following immediate operative management, patients may completely recover and receive cytotoxic chemotherapy with substantial possibilities of achieving complete remission.
