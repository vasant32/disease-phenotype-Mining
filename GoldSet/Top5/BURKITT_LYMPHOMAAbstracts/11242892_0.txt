Present knowledge and available pharmacological agents allow for adequate prevention and treatment of pain in children. We present guidelines we prepared for the prevention and treatment of procedural pain in children in our general pediatric ward. This followed extensive review of the literature, participation in scientific meetings, discussions with experts and consultation with interested clinicians. Successful implementation of the guidelines requires increased appreciation of the importance of pain prevention, participation of the nursing, as well as medical staff, and ability to evaluate pain in children of various ages.
