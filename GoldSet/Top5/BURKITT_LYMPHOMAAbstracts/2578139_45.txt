A monoclonal anti-DNA antibody PME77, spontaneously produced in autoimmune B/W mice, has been found to recognize identical protein(s) present at the surface of several human cell types involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus: glomeruli, platelets, erythrocytes, T and B cells, and neuronal tissue. Data indicate that protein(s) could represent a major stimulus or the target of anti-DNA autoimmunity and could account for tissue lesions observed in this disease.
