Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a haemopoietic growth factor produced by mesenchymal cells but not T lymphocytes after stimulation with specific cytokines or mitogens. A 330 bp promoter fragment of the human G-CSF gene induced reporter gene expression in human embryonic lung fibroblasts in response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). The same promoter fragment was not active in Jurkat T cells nor did it respond to phorbol ester in either cell type. At least three distinct elements, the CK-1 sequence, a decanucleotide present in haemopoietic growth factor genes, an NF-IL-6 consensus sequence and a consensus octamer sequence, were essential in the G-CSF promoter for TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta response. Mutation of any of these sequences abolished promoter function. In contrast, mutation of two other consensus protein binding sequences, i.e. a Pu-1 site and a CK-2-like sequence, did not eliminate promoter function. Both the CK-1 and octamer sequences acted independently as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta responsive elements upstream of a heterologous promoter. The response of the octamer sequence and the 330 bp promoter but not the CK-1 sequence was greater with IL-1 beta than TNF-alpha reflecting a similar response of the endogenous gene.
