To establish a rapid and sensitive method to detect neoplastic cells carrying a specific chromosomal translocation in B-cell lymphoma/leukemia, we have developed a novel strategy based on long distance polymerase chain reaction (LD-PCR) amplification. Genomic DNA were extracted from tumor cells carrying a t(14;19)(q32;q13), a t(8;14)(q24;q32), a t(3;22)(q27;q11), a t(2;3)(p12;q27), and a t(3;14)(q27;q32). Oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed to be complementary to exons or flanking sequences of the BCL3, c-MYC and BCL6 oncogenes, and to constant region genes of the IG genes. LD-PCR with a newly available Taq polymerase for longer product synthesis successfully amplified fragments representing BCL3/C alpha junctional sequences for t(14;19); c-MYC/C mu, c-MYC/C gamma and c-MYC/C alpha for t(8;14); BCL6/C lambda for t(3;22); BCL6/C kappa for t(2;3); 5'-BCL6/C mu and 5'-BCL6/C gamma for t(3;14), respectively. The sizes of the amplified fragments were varied from 1.8 kb to 12 kb, which were specific to each material. Present study provides a useful tool for diagnosis and subsequent management of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia characterized with specific chromosomal translocation.
