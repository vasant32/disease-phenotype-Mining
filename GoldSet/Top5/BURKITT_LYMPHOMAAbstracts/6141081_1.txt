Between the years 1977 and 1981, 9037 patients gave birth at Jordan University Hospital (JUH). Among these ten patients were found to have an associated ovarian tumor, an incidence of one in 900 deliveries. Benign cystic teratomas were the most common ovarian tumors found, followed by mucinous cystadenomas. All of the tumors were benign except one case of Burkitt's lymphoma.
