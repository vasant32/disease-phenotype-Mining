Immortalized B lymphocytes produce a factor(s) that stimulates growth of B cell lines carrying Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Stimulatory supernatants derived from B cells also exhibit interleukin-1 (IL-1) activity in costimulator assays with the D10.G4.1 helper T cell line. Experiments with purified macrophage-derived IL-1 and recombinant IL-1 beta demonstrate that IL-1 stimulates proliferation of the cell lines that respond to the factors from B lymphocyte lines. One B cell line, Ramos, an EBV-Burkitt's lymphoma, contrasts with other B cell lines in that it is refractory to the growth enhancing effects of B cell conditioned medium and macrophage-derived IL-1. When EBV was introduced into Ramos cells, growth was enhanced by the factor(s) in B cell conditioned medium (six out of seven lines); growth of EBV-converted Ramos lines (six out of seven lines) also was enhanced by IL-1. These findings demonstrate that infection of a non-responsive transformed B lymphocyte by EBV induces cellular responsiveness to factor-mediated growth stimulation.
