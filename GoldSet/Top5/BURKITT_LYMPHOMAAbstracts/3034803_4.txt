Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is associated with two malignant diseases, African Burkitt's Lymphoma (BL) and Undifferentiated Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (UNPC). North Africa is a geographical area with a high incidence of NPC. Our purpose in this study was to explore cell-mediated immunity of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from patients with UNPC and DNPC. We found an elevated percentage of OKT8 cells and of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) (30-35% HNK-I-positive cells) compared to PBL from healthy matched individuals. PBL from NPC patients contained 35% HLA-DR-positive and 30% Interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor-positive circulating lymphocytes. PBL from NPC patients exhibited a normal proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and Concanavalin A (Con A) and an increased response to pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Natural killer (NK) activity towards K562 cells was low in our patients who, in addition, exhibited no lytic activity against HLA-matched EBV-transformed B cells. This lack of cytotoxicity against an EBV-transformed B-cell line cannot be explained by an impairment of IL-2 secretion, and is probably a result of the presence of high numbers of OKT8 suppressor T cells.
