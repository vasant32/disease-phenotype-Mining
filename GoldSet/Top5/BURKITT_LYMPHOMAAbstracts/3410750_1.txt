A retrospective study of 24 children suffering from nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) during the years 1974-1983 is reported. The diagnosis was delayed because of the primary tumor site and difficulty in examination. Cervical lymph node enlargement (83.3%) was the commonest presenting symptom. The diagnosis was usually confirmed by cervical lymph node biopsy. Boys were affected 1.6 times more frequently than girls. In all, 91% of our cases had an anaplastic carcinoma, and 70% were in stage T3 or T4. Supplementation of radiotherapy by intensive chemotherapy even for stages T1 and T2 improves the survival. Survival is decreased by cervical lymph node metastases.
