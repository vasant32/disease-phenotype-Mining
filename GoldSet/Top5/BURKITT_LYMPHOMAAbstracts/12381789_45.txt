The TCL1 protooncogene is overexpressed in many mature B cell lymphomas, especially from AIDS patients. To determine whether aberrant expression promotes B cell transformation, we generated a murine model in which a TCL1 transgene was overexpressed at similar levels in both B and T cells. Strikingly, transgenic mice developed Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL) and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with attendant Bcl-6 expression and mutated J(H) gene segments at a very high penetrance beginning at 4 months of age. In contrast, only one mouse developed a T cell malignancy at 15 months, consistent with a longer latency for transformation of T cells by TCL1. Activation of premalignant splenic B cells by means of B cell antigen receptor (BCR) engagement resulted in significantly increased proliferation and augmented AKT-dependent signaling, including increased S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation. Transgenic spleen cells also survived longer than wild-type spleen cells in long-term culture. Together these data demonstrate that TCL1 is a powerful oncogene that, when overexpressed in both B and T cells, predominantly yields mature B cell lymphomas.
