We have used in situ chromosome hybridization techniques to map the human cellular counterparts (c-onc genes) of the transforming genes of two RNA tumor viruses on human meiotic pachytene and somatic metaphase chromosomes. We find that the human c-mos gene is located on chromosome 8 at a position corresponding to band 8q22 on the somatic map. The human c-myc gene is found on chromosome 8 at position 8q24. These regions on the long arm of chromosome 8 have been previously reported to be involved in specific translocations found in the M-2 subset of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemias. Burkitt lymphoma, and other forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and a familial abnormality that predisposes to renal cell carcinoma. These results suggest that translocations of the human c-mos or c-myc genes may be causally related to neoplastic transformation.
