INTRODUCTION: Acute tumour lysis syndrome (ATLS) is a potentially lethal but preventable complication of oncological treatment. CLINICAL PICTURE: We report a case of a patient with Burkitt's leukaemia who developed ATLS after treatment with chemotherapy. TREATMENT: Standard preventive measures using aggressive hydration, urine alkalinisation and uricosuric agents were instituted before chemotherapy. OUTCOME: However in spite of adequate measures, the patient succumbed to the sequelae of ATLS. CONCLUSIONS: It is therefore important to identify patients who are at a high risk of developing ATLS so that additional measures can be taken to prevent it from occurring.
