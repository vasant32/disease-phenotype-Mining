Human herpesviruses have been associated with numerous diseases throughout history (Table 3), but their ability to induce latent and recurrent infections, alongwith their oncogenic capabilities, is only beginning to be understood. Accordingly, our ability to deal with the diseases induced by herpesviruses is severely limited by our lack of information concerning the basic processes of virus-host cell interactions and systemic host factors; especially immune factors that are involved in the disease process.
