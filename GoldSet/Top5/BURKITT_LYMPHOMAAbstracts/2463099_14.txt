The CD22 antigen is expressed on the surface of normal human B cells and some neoplastic B cell lines and tumors. Previous cross-blocking studies using a panel of monoclonal anti-CD22 antibodies have defined four epitope groups, termed A-D. In the present studies, we have further dissected the epitopes recognized by four monoclonal anti-CD22 antibodies using immunoprecipitation and cross-blocking techniques, immunofluorescence analyses with a variety of cell lines, and immunoperoxidase analyses of 36 normal human tissues. Two of the antibodies, HD6 and RFB4, have been described previously, and two, UV22-1 and UV22-2, are described in this report. Our studies indicate that the four monoclonal antibodies show unexpected complexities in their reactivity with CD22+ and CD22- cells and their reactivity with solubilized CD22 molecules. The four antibodies, which recognize epitopes defined previously as CD22-A and CD22-B, further subdivide these epitope clusters into four determinants, A1, A2, B1, and B2. Furthermore, only two of the antibodies, RFB4 and UV22-2, are B cell-specific. In summary, our data indicate that RFB4 and UV22-2 would be the antibodies of choice for constructing immunotoxins to treat B cell tumors.
