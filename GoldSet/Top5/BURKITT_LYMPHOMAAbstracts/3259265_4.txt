To improve the applicability of immunotoxins (ITs), we have developed a new two-step indirect procedure. The target cells to be killed are first incubated with cell-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). After removal of excess unbound antibody, the cells are incubated in the presence of lactose with an indirect IT, a conjugate of whole abrin and sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin (SAM) that binds only to cells having primary mouse MAbs on their surfaces. The SAM-abrin IT is affinity purified before use to remove molecules with exposed B-chain-binding sites; it was nontoxic in the absence of the specific mouse MAbs, demonstrating the specificity of the two-step method. We compared the indirect approach, using four different primary MAbs, with the conventional method, in which abrin is coupled directly to the mouse MAbs. In three human cell lines--the melanoma line FEMX, the Burkitt cell line Rael, and the leukemia cell line KM3--the cell kill, measured by a clonogenic assay, was consistently greater with the indirect than with the direct method. In the melanoma and Rael cells, the indirect method gave a higher cell kill than even native abrin. With a mixture of two different antibodies an additive effect was observed with the indirect but not with the direct method. The new approach greatly simplifies the therapeutic application in vitro of ITs, because it permits the use of different primary antibodies, singly or in mixtures, in conjunction with only one or a few general indirect ITs. In efforts to further improve the usefulness of the indirect method, other indirect ITs containing different toxin moieties are being examined. The possibility of employing the indirect principle in vivo is being explored.
