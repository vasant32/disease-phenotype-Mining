The secretion of interferon (IFN)-gamma by T lymphocytes is mediated by the synthesis of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and the availability of IL-2 receptors. Since some Burkitt's lymphoma lines express Tac antigen and can be triggered to secrete IL-2 following activation with the new tumor promoter teleocidin, we addressed the question of whether the induction of IL-2 by B lymphocytes is accompanied by the induction of IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma has not been detected in any of the 25 cell lines studied, and following stimulation with teleocidin, we triggered the synthesis of IFN-gamma in JLP(C), a pre-Burkitt's cell line. The mechanism of IFN-gamma secretion by B lymphocytes is not clear. Our findings demonstrate that the synthesis of IL-2 by B cells is not accompanied by IFN-gamma and suggest that the synthesis of IFN-gamma is not mediated by IL-2 or IL-1 or B-cell growth factor. Neutralization studies have shown that IFN-gamma secretion is not accompanied by the induction of IFN-alpha or IFN-beta. Our data imply that B cells can be triggered to secrete IFN-gamma under certain circumstances. Whether similar function occurs in vivo is not known.
