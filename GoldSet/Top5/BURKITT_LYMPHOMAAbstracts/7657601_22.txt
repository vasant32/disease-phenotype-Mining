Hematopoietic cell phosphatase is a nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase that is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cell lineages. Motheaten mice, which are devoid of (functional) hematopoietic cell phosphatase, have severe disturbances in the regulation of B cell activation and differentiation. Because signals transduced via the B cell antigen receptor are known to guide these processes, we decided to analyze molecular interactions between the hematopoietic cell phosphatase and the B cell antigen receptor. Ligation of the B cell antigen receptor induces moderate tyrosine phosphorylation of hematopoietic cell phosphatase and the formation of a multi-molecular complex containing additional 68-70- and 135-kDa phosphoproteins. In resting B cells most of the hematopoietic cell phosphatase proteins reside in the cytosolic compartment, whereas after B cell antigen receptor cross-linking, a small fraction translocates toward the membrane where it specifically binds to the 135-kDa phosphoprotein. This 135-kDa glycoprotein was identified as CD22, a transmembrane associate of the B cell antigen receptor complex. Together these findings provide the first direct evidence that this cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase is involved in antigen receptor-mediated B cell activation, suggesting that in vivo B cell antigen receptor constituents or associated molecules may serve as substrate for its catalytic activity.
