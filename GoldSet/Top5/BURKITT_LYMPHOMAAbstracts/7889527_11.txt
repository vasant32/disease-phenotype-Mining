The biological significance of apoptosis is becoming increasingly clear. Its relevance in tumor response to treatment as well as recent evidence for its important function as a regulating mechanism in tumorigenesis has also been demonstrated. One of the most prominent biological features of apoptosis is nucleosomal DNA fragmentation. In this communication, we present a study of DNA fragmentation in Raji cells which have been subjected to hyperthermia treatment to induce apoptosis. We found that the induction and onset of fragmentation is swift, and consistent with previous reports that fragmentation must be a rapid event.
