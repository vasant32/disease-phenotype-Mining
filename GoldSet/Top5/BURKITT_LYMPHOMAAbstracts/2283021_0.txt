It has been established that acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells showing identical immunological phenotype have similar morphometric values and electrophoretic mobility that significantly distinguish them from lymphoblasts of other subvariants. These results have evidenced the expedience of using these criteria for correct identification of leukemic cells. Besides that, similarity of phenotypic features of leukemic cells of a particular line, having identical differentiation status, has supported the opinion on their lineal affiliation.
