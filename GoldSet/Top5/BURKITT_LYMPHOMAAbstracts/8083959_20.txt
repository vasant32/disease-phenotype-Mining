Since deletion of region 3 (amino acids [aa] 333 to 425) of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear protein 2 (EBNA-2) results in EBV recombinants which cannot transform primary B lymphocytes (J. I. Cohen, F. Wang, and E. Kieff, J. Virol. 65:2545-2554, 1991), the role of domains of region 3 was investigated. Deletion of the Arg-Gly repeat domain, R-337GQSRGRGRGRGRGRGKG354, results in EBV recombinants that transform primary B lymphocytes with modestly decreased activity. The transformed cells grow slowly and are difficult to expand. EBNA-2 deleted for the Arg-Gly domain does not associate with the nuclear chromatin fraction. The Arg-Gly repeat has an intrinsic ability to bind to histone H1, to other proteins, including EBNA-1, and to nucleic acids, especially poly(G). Two independent deletions of each part of the rest of region 3 (aa 359 to 383 and 385 to 430) have little effect on transformation, while deletion of the rest of region 3 (aa 361 to 425) as a single segment substantially reduces transformation efficiency. EBNA-2 deleted for all of region 3 can still transactivate the LMP1 promoter in transient expression assays but is less active than EBNA-2 in transactivating the BamHI-C promoter. EBNA-2 deleted for the Arg-Gly domain is better than EBNA-2 at transactivating the LMP1 promoter and is as active as EBNA-2 in transactivating the BamHI-C promoter. These data are most compatible with a model in which the Arg-Gly domain of region 3 is a modulator of EBNA-2 interactions and activities, while the rest of region 3 is important in positioning the region 2 J kappa binding domain relative to the region 4 acidic transactivating domain. Despite the null phenotype of the region 3 deletion, region 3 is unlikely to mediate essential interactions with other proteins.
