Thirteen patients affected by Burkitt's lymphoma were studied. Six out of them had cluster headache associated with Burkitt's lymphoma, and in this group we observed the absence of HLA-B14 antigen. The presence of HLA-B14 antigen in the remaining seven patients, confirm the hypothesis of a protective role of this antigen against cluster headache.
