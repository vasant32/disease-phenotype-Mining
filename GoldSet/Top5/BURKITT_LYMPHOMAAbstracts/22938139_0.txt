The impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the outcome of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphoma with life-threatening complications requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission is not well known. The objective of this study was to compare the outcome of patients with lymphoma transferred to the ICU according to HIV infection status. The clinical characteristics, reason for ICU admission, and outcome of 48 consecutive critically ill patients with lymphoma admitted to the ICU from January 2000 to March 2010 was retrospectively analyzed, focusing on their HIV serology status. Thirty-six patients were HIV-negative and 12 patients HIV-positive. Burkitt lymphoma was more frequent in HIV-infected patients, whereas diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was more frequent in HIV-negative patients. The main acute life-threatening diseases precipitating ICU transfer were similar in both groups. Severe neutropenia was more frequent in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative patients. With a median follow-up of 53 months after ICU admission, the overall survival probabilities were 15% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3-27%) and 17% (95% CI: 0-38%) for HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients, respectively. The 2-year survival probabilities were 34% (95% CI: 10-58%) and 40% (95% CI: 0-43%) for HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients discharged from the ICU, respectively. In this study, HIV infection did not have a negative impact on the outcome of patients with lymphoma admitted to the ICU.
