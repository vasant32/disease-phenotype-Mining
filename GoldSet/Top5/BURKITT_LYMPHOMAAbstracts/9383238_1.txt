A 15-year-old female with pre-pre B ALL in third relapse was treated with administration of eight blood bank leukocyte concentrates per day for 5 days. The total number of mononuclear cells per kilogram of weight was 4.89 x 10(8). On the fifth day of infusions the patient was in complete remission (CR), asymptomatic and with a normal CBC. No secondary effects were found. The patient remained in CR without treatment for 10 weeks before relapsing again. The possibility of reaching a short-lived, clinically relevant response, using blood bank leukocyte infusions, is a promising new approach for the treatment of leukemia.
