The CBA/H mouse model of radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was re-examined using molecular approaches. In addition to the typical promyelocytic AMLs, 34% were reclassified as early pre-B lympho-myeloid leukemias (L-ML) based on leukemic blood cell morphology, immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene re-arrangements (IgH(R)), or expression of both lymphoid (Vpre-B1 and Rag1) and myeloid (myeloperoxidase and lysozyme M) genes. Allelic loss on chromosome 4 was frequently detected in AMLs (53%) and L-MLs (more than 95%), and the preferential loss of the maternally transmitted allele suggests the locus may be imprinted. A minimally deleted region (MDR) maps to a 3.4-cM interval, which is frequently deleted in radiation-induced thymic lymphomas (TLSR5) and contains a recessive, maternally transmitted genetic locus (Lyr2) that confers resistance to spontaneous and radiation-induced pre-B and T cell lymphomas, suggesting they are one and the same. Thus, the Lyr2/TLSR5 locus is frequently implicated in myeloid, lymphoid (B and T), and mixed-lineage mouse leukemias and lymphomas. Epigenetic inactivation of one Lyr2/TLSR5 allele during normal mouse development suggests that only a single hit is required for its inactivation during leukemogenesis, and this may be a significant contributing factor to the efficiency of the leukemogenic process in the mouse.
