The retinoblastoma-related gene Rb2/p130 has been reported to be mutated in several malignancies such as lung cancer and Burkitt's lymphoma. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common cancer in Malaysia especially amongst the ethnic Chinese. We screened for Rb2/p130 gene (exons 19 to 21) mutations in 53 archival NPC samples via PCR-SSCP-direct sequencing approach. Only one sample had a base change which involved a serine to glycine substitution at codon 995 (S995G). We conclude that Rb2/p130 genetic alterations are infrequent in NPC and may not be essential for the pathogenesis of the disease.
