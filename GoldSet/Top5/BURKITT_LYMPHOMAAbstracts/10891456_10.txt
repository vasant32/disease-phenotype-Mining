Cell migration requires a dynamic interaction between the cell, its substrate, and the cytoskeleton-associated motile apparatus. Integrin-associated protein (IAP)/CD47 is a 50-kd cell surface protein that is physically associated with beta3 integrins and that modulates the functions of beta3 integrins in various cells. However, in B-lymphocytes that express beta1 integrins but few beta3 integrins, the roles of IAP/CD47 remain to be determined. Cross-linking of IAP/CD47 by the immobilized anti-IAP/CD47 monoclonal antibody (mAb) B6H12, but not 2D3, produced signals to promote polarization with lamellipodia, a characteristic morphology during leukocyte migration, in pre-B and mature B-cell lines (BALL, Nalm6, ONHL-1, Daudi), but not in myeloma cell lines (RPMI8226, OPM-2). In the presence of the immobilized fibronectin (FN), soluble B6H12 could increase the rate of the polarization and activate migratory activity of BALL cells to FN in a transwell filter assay. Furthermore, the dominant-negative form of CDC42 completely blocked B6H12-induced morphologic and functional changes without inhibiting phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced spreading on FN in BALL cells, whereas the dominant-negative form of Rac1 inhibited all these changes. These findings demonstrate that in B-lymphocytes, IAP/CD47 may transduce the signals to activate the migratory activity, in which CDC42 may be specifically involved, and that IAP/CD47 shows synergistic effect with alpha4beta1 on B-cell migration. These findings would provide new insight into the role of IAP/CD47 on B-cell function.
