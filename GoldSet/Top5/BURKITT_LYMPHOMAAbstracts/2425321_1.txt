Primary intestinal lymphomas (PIL) include a number of interesting clinical and pathological subtypes with distinct geographic, socioeconomic and age distribution patterns. This report describes clinical and pathologic features of 37 Iraqi children with PIL seen 1965-1983. Three distinct groups were recognized: Mediterranean lymphoma, 11 patients, characterized by diffuse involvement of the proximal bowel; commonly presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea and malabsorption; Burkitt's lymphoma, 13 patients, characterized by localized tumor in the distal ileum or ileocecal region; commonly presents with intussusception, abdominal tumor and pain, and Non-Burkitt's lymphoma, 13 patients, usually occurs as localized tumors in the distal ileum; commonly presents with abdominal tumor, pain and intestinal obstruction.
