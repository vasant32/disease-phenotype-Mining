1. The occurrence of lysozyme, neuraminidase and fourteen other glycosidases was investigated in the three lymphoma cell lines Namalva, Raji and Daudi derived from a Burkitt's lymphoma and the lymphoblastoid cell line Robinson from Epstein-Barr virus transformed normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. High activity of beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase was found in three of the cell lines, which also showed fairly high activities of beta-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminidase, alpha-D-mannosidase and beta-D-mannosidase. In Daudi the highest glycosidase activity was found for beta-D-mannosidase. 2. Neuraminidase and lysozyme were not detected in any of the four cell lines. 3. These cell lines showed characteristic enzyme patterns and enzyme ratios which may be used for the identification of the cell lines. 4. When calculated on a protein basis no statistically significant change in glycosidase activities of the cells could be recorded during interferon production.
