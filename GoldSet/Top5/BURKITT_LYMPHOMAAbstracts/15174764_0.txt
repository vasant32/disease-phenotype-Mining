Burkitt's lymphoma is rare outside of Africa, and head and neck manifestations of this disease are even more uncommon. We report a case of Burkitt's lymphoma localized at the bifurcation of the right common carotid artery in a 64-year-old man. The presenting symptoms were recurrent syncopes that necessitated a pacemaker, followed by a rapid onset of cranial nerve palsies. The tumor had infiltrated cranial nerves IX, X, XI, and XII and was resected by selective neck dissection. The patient was subsequently treated with a chemotherapeutic regimen consisting of a combination of cytosine arabinoside, vincristine, ifosfamide, prednisone, and an intrathecal application of methotrexate. He also underwent external-beam irradiation of the neck. The patient has been followed up for a period of 42 months and has no evidence of recurrent disease. Repeated diagnostic testing and a coordination of multiple disciplines can speed diagnosis and therapeutic management. The current literature is reviewed and discussed.
