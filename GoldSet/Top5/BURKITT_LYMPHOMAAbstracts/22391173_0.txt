This article aimed to report two cases of Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia with concurrent t(8;14) and t(14;18). Morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetics and molecular biology (MICM) methods were applied to diagnosis. The results showed that the two cases were both acute lymphocytic leukemia L3 type according to FAB criteria. Conventional cytogenetic technique or interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated that t(8;14) and t(14;18) were detected concurrently in both patients. CD20, CD10, FMC7, CD38 and CD19 were expressed in both patients by immunophenotyping. According to MICM, they were both diagnosed as Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia. The first patient died in one month after chemotherapy, and the second patient survived 19 months after rituximab- combined high-dose chemotherapy and subsequently allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In conclusion, t(8;14) and t(14;18) may present simultaneously in Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia and indicate poor prognosis. Rituximab-combined chemotherapy and subsequently HSCT could improve the outcomes of such cases.
