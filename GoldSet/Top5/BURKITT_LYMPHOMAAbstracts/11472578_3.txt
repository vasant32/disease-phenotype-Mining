BACKGROUND: The CD44, a cell surface proteoglycan, participates in a variety of function including tumor dissemination and metastasis. However, there are no available data on the prognostic significance of CD44 expression of tumor tissue correlated with serum sCD44 level in childhood leukemias and lymphomas. METHODS: Serum levels and leukemic cell tumor tissue expression of CD44 were detected in 54 children with acute leukemia and malignant lymphoma. Serum samples were obtained from all patients before treatment and during remission. Twelve age-matched healthy children were included as a control group. RESULTS: The serum CD44 levels were significantly higher in patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) than those in the control group. The median values were 1627.0, 1336.0, 1318.5, 1730.4, 902.7 ng/mL, respectively, and P<0.001, P<0.01, P<0.01, P<0.05 in comparisons, respectively. However, there was no significant difference between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the control group (median values: 900.3 and 902.7 ng/mL, respectively, P>0.05). Serum sCD44 levels significantly declined in HD, NHL and ALL patients who were in complete remission (median values: 684.0, 573.8 and 1101.1 ng/mL, respectively, P<0.05 in each comparison). Patients with HD had higher levels of serum sCD44 and correlated well with higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), B-symptoms and advanced-stage disease (P<0.05, P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). Expression of CD44 was significantly high in patients with HD and NHL who were in advanced stages of disease. High serum CD44 level was also associated with high tumor tissue expression of CD44 in patients with HD and BL. In addition, patients with higher levels of serum sCD44, had a poorer outcome and survival than those with lower sCD44 levels in HD and NHL groups. CONCLUSIONS: A high serum sCD44 level and/or tumor tissue expression at diagnosis is associated with poor prognostic criteria and/or unfavorable outcome in childhood leukemias and lymphomas.
