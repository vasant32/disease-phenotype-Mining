Transfection of an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded plasmid containing EBER caused a substantial decrease in the level of plasmid containing EBV in Akata and Mutu Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) lines, but failed to do so in other BL lines. The results suggest that EBER could replace the role of EBV, but other EBV products also play a role in the growth of BL.
