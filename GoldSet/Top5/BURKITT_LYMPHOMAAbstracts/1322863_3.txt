The human and chimpanzee T-cell receptor gamma-delta (TCR gamma delta) bearing cells represent a minor subset (3-8%) of T lymphocytes. In the periphery, the TCR gamma delta population has a restricted combinatorial repertoire. The TCRD-V1 and -V2 gene products are expressed in a mutually exclusive fashion, whereas, the TCRD-V2 and the TCRG-V9 encoded proteins show, in general, a coordinated expression. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis showed conservation of the restriction sites that identify the TCRG-V9 and TCRD-V2 rearrangements. The human TCRG-V9 locus has two alleles, TCRG-V9A1 and TCRG-V9A2 differing at codon position 31. The chimpanzee TCRG-V9 gene product differs from the products of the human TCRG-V9A1 and TCRG-V9A2 allele by two and three amino acid replacements, respectively. The human and the chimpanzee TCRG-V9-TCRD-V2 lymphocytes show a similar specific proliferative and cytolytic response to human Daudi Burkitt's lymphoma cells. Therefore, the amino acid replacements found in the chimpanzee TCRG-V9 gene product do not change the superantigen specificity across this species barrier.
