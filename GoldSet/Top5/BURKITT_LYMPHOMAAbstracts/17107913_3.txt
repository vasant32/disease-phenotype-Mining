The anti-CD19 immunotoxin (IT) (HD37-dgRTA) is effective in killing B-lineage leukemia cells and in curing severe combined immunodeficient mice with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The present study aimed to identify effective combinations of HD37-dgRTA and chemotherapeutic agents. The in-vitro cytotoxicity assays demonstrate that the combination of HD37-dgRTA and either daunorubicin or vincristine is effective. The in-vivo experiments using HD37-dgRTA with vincristine prolonged the survival of mice compared to the chemotherapeutic agent or IT (90.7 vs. 147.1 days). Also, 80% of the mice treated with IT plus vincristine were long-term survivors.
