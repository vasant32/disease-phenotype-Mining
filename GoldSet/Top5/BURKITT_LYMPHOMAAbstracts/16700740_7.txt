OBJECTIVE: CD10 is expressed on the majority of follicle-center lymphomas and Burkitt lymphomas. CD10 has also been shown to be present in a variety of other neoplasms. DESIGN: The aim of this study was a correlation of CD10 and several parameters: age, tumor size, presence of lymph node metastases, clinic stage, histologic grading, presence of local recurrences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The tissues of 77 consecutive patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma were evaluated using immunostaining with monoclonal antibody for CD10. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Highly significant correlations were found with the lymph node status, the presence of local recurrences and the histologic grading. The presence of CD10-positive cells was not correlated with the age of patients, tumor size and clinic stage. RESULTS: The results of the present study show that in oral squamous cell carcinoma CD10 positivity is an indicator of worse prognosis. Another strong correlation was found with the presence of local recurrences. Also the histologic grade was significantly correlated with the CD10 positivity. CONCLUSION: Our results point to the fact that CD10 expression can, perhaps, have an important role in tumor invasion, probably facilitating the occurrence of metastases.
