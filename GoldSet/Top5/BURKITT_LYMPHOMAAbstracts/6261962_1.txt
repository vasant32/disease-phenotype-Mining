Rabbit antibodies were obtained to nonhistone protein--DNA complexes (dehistonized chromatin) prepared from two human lymphoblastoid cell lines: the Conception line from an American Burkitt lymphoma and NC-37 from a nonmalignant source. Both antisera showed a high degree of specificity for nuclear proteins of their respective cell lines. This specificity was evident in the reactivity of both whole chromatin and dehistonized chromatin using a quantitative micro-complement fixation assay. The results presented here suggest that DNA present in the antigen is necessary for maintaining the structure of the antigenic site.
