The observation that 3-aminobenzamide, which inhibits a variety of ADP-ribose transferases, prolongs the gamma-irradiation-induced increase in intracellular p53 concentration suggested that one or more of such enzymes may determine the duration of the p53 response during G1 arrest. The role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), an abundant nuclear enzyme activated by DNA strand breaks, in the p53 response to y-irradiation was investigated in Burkitt's lymphoma AG876 cells stably transfected with an inducible PARP antisense construct. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the cellular content of PARP was reduced to virtually undetectable levels after incubation of transfected cells for 72 h with the inducer dexamethasone. In noninduced antisense cells, the p53 concentration reached a maximum 2 h after exposure to 6.3 Gy of gamma-radiation and returned to control values by 4 h. In contrast, the p53 response in PARP-depleted antisense cells peaked at 4 h, with the levels of p53 remaining elevated for up to 12 h after y-irradiation. The maximal increase in p53 concentration was similar in both induced and noninduced cells. These results thus indicate that PARP activity, in part, determines the duration, but not the magnitude, of the p53 response to DNA damage.
