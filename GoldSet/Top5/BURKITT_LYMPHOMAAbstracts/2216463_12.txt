We have studied the allele specific expression of c-myc P0- and P3-RNA in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells. The steady state levels of P0-RNA show considerable variations in BL cells. Expression of P0-RNA was found to be restricted to the translocated allele, but could be induced by TPA from the normal allele. P0-transcription was particularly sensitive to inhibitors of protein synthesis compared to expression of P1-, P2- and P3-RNA. Transcription of P3-RNA is initiated in the first intron of the c-myc gene and has previously been described to be specific for translocated c-myc alleles in BL cells broken within exon 1 or intron 1. Here we show that P3-RNA is also expressed from an unrearranged c-myc gene. In the BL cell line Raji, substantial amounts of c-myc RNA are derived from the P3-promoter of the normal allele. This indicates that repression of the normal allele in BL cells does not include the P3-promoter. The potential coding capacity of P3-RNA is discussed.
