Patients with endemic Burkitt's lymphoma who failed primary treatment with the Malawi 2002 or 2003 Burkitt's lymphoma treatment protocols, consisting of high frequency cyclophosphamide 40 mg/kg and intrathecal methotrexate, were offered rescue chemotherapy. Twenty-eight patients (14 boys and 14 girls; age range 3-13 years) with resistant disease (n=8) or relapse (n=20) presented to the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi. Treatment consisted of cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg and vincristine 1.5 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 1, 8 and 15, plus intrathecal methotrexate on the same days in those patients treated for a relapse. The majority of patients (81%) had St Jude stage III or IV disease. Twenty patients (71%) achieved a complete clinical remission. Day 8 treatment was delayed in eight children and Day 15 treatment in five patients, both for a median of 7 days, mainly due to neutropenia. Ten patients relapsed after 42-311 days (median 105 days). Ten patients (36%) remained in remission for 353-712 days (median 487 days). Patients whose first relapse occurred after 6 months as well as those with limited disease had the best outcome. This simple 15-day chemotherapy schedule salvaged 36% of patients and significantly increased the overall cure rate of our Burkitt's lymphoma patients.
