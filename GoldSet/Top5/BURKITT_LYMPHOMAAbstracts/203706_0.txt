Patients with Burkitt's lymphoma in chemotherapy-induced remission received through dermal scarifications one or two doses per week of approximately 3 X 10(8) living BCG organisms (Pasteur Institute vaccine). This treatment was always followed by usually rapid increases by 1--4 log2 steps in the antibody titers to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated cell membrane antigens. Titer increases of less than 2.5 log2 steps within the first month after the start of BCG treatment correlated with a significantly elevated frequency of extradural relapse as compared to that seen in patients with larger titer rises. During this time, antibodies to EBV-associated viral capsid antigens and early antigens of D and R specificity, as well as antibodies against herpes simplex, varicella, cytomegalovirus, measles, and respiratory syncytial virus antigens, did not show any consistent or impressive changes.
