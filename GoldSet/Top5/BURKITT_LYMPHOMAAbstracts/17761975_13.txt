 PURPOSE: We analyzed the prevalence, clinical pattern, and prognostic impact of CNS involvement in a large cohort of children and adolescents diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), with special attention to differences according to NHL subtype. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October 1986 to December 2002, 2,381 patients (median age, 9.37 years; range, 0.2 to 23.8 years; female-to-male ratio, 1:2.7) from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland were registered. A total of 2,086 patients were eligible for the consecutive multicenter protocols NHL-Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster [BFM] -86, NHL-BFM-90, and NHL-BFM-95, and could be evaluated for outcome. RESULTS: CNS involvement was diagnosed in 141 (5.9%) of 2,381 patients and was associated with an advanced stage of NHL. The percentage of CNS-positive patients was 8.8% for Burkitt's lymphoma/Burkitt's leukemia (BL/B-ALL), 5.4% for precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphoma (pB-LBL), 3.3% for anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, 3.2% for T-cell-LBL, 2.6% for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and 0% for primary mediastinal large B-cell NHL (P < .001). Most CNS-positive patients with pB-LBL, T-LBL, or BL/B-ALL had meningeal disease. The probability of event-free survival (pEFS; +/- SE) at 5 years was 85% +/- 1% for the 2,086 protocol patients (median follow-up, 6.5 years; range, 0.3 to 17.7 years). For the 112 CNS-positive patients, pEFS was 64% +/- 5%, compared with 86% +/- 1% for the 1,927 CNS-negative patients (P < .001). Although CNS disease had no impact on pEFS for advanced-stage T-LBL patients, CNS-positive patients with BL/B-ALL had a worse average outcome than CNS-negative patients with stage IV BL/B-ALL (60% +/- 5% v 81% +/- 3%; P < .001). In multivariate analysis, CNS disease was the strongest predictor for relapse in BL/B-ALL patients with advanced-stage disease. CONCLUSION: Six percent of childhood/adolescent NHL patients were CNS positive. However, the prevalence, pattern, and prognostic impact of CNS involvement differed among NHL subtypes.
