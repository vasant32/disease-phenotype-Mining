One and one-half percent of human sera from patients seen at a clinic for treatment of cancer contained antibodies to the nuclei of chick kidney cells by indirect immunofluorescence tests. In the group of sera containing antinuclear antibodies, the geometric mean titer to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) capsid antigen was significantly elevated. Sera obtained from normal adults or from patients with similar histological types of tumors that possessed no antinuclear antibodies contained lower levels of anti-EBV antibodies. The elevated titers to EBV were correlated with the presence or absence of antinuclear antibodies and not with a particular type or site of neoplastic disease.
