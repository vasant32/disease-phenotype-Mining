In further studying the mechanism of action of IFN-alpha in HCL, we cultured the HCL cell line JOK-1 and the IFN-sensitive Burkitt cell line Daudi with and without IFN-alpha and investigated the changes in density of a number of surface antigens by use of mAb and flow cytometry analyses. During culture with IFN-alpha, reproducible changes were induced in both cell lines, which were qualitatively similar but differed quantitatively with small and transient changes in JOK-1. Significant decreases in surface antigen expression were observed for CD 19, 23, 37, and for IgM on both cell lines. Moreover, decreases were seen for CD 10, 22, 45, and MHC class II on Daudi, and for CD 20, 21, 27, and 40 on JOK-1. By contrast, only a few antigens increased in density, including CD 39, A96/G8 and SC9, on both cell lines, CD 22 on JOK-1, and CD 21 on Daudi. The increase in CD 39, A96/G8 and SC9 was probably directly related to the mechanism of action of IFN-alpha, whereas the other changes were most consistent with an unspecific inhibition of protein synthesis, possibly due to an accumulation of cells in G0, even though a differentiating effect cannot be ruled out. Thus, the unique in vivo effect of IFN-alpha in HCL was not paralleled by a specific direct effect on JOK-1 in vitro. Our findings therefore do not support the theory that IFN's mechanism of action in vivo is a direct effect on HC, but suggest that indirect effects are involved.
