Fine needle aspiration diagnosis is a well established technique. However, its application to lymphomas has been quite limited. From September 1977 to January 1981, the Lymphoma Group at the CCABC performed 213 aspirates. Of the 213, 180 were considered to be diagnostically useful, with 33 being unsatisfactory or no action was taken. Of the 180 considered useful, 170 were positive, and prompted institution of therapy (84), provided guide to appropriate treatment (84), provided rapid solution to clinical situation (65), provided improved understanding of clinical situation (78), and prevented invasive procedure [minor (local anesthetic), 31; intermediate (general anesthetic), 88; major (laparotomy or thoracotomy), 18]. Ten negative results delayed therapy (3), led to unnecessary or inappropriate investigation (1), led to incorrect therapy, (4), and were a source of confusion (10). In most circumstances, the authors tried to avoid fine needle aspirations as the only basis for an initial diagnosis. In a previously diagnosed lymphoma, aspiration aided in staging, in confirming recurrence, in the diagnosis of new and unrelated malignancy or undiagnosed infection and in assessing the evolution of a lymphoma to a more aggressive form. Aspiration diagnosis was considered to be a useful adjunct in the care of patients with lymphoma and it is especially suited to use by a closely working team of clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists.
