The effects of five microbial and one synthetic protease inhibitors on the activation of Epstein-Barr virus expression in latency infected lymphoblastoid cells were studied. All protease inhibitors tested suppressed both viral antigen induction by 5-iododeoxyuridine treatment and cell growth in general. Among the inhibitors, however, antipain and pepstatin exerted a relatively strong and significant suppressive effect on antigen induction as compared to their inhibitory effect on cell growth.
