Biopsy specimens obtained from 20 cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma were examined under electronmicroscope for the presence of Intracisternal Tubular Inclusions (ITI). In eight (40 per cent) of them these inclusions could be identified. Although the morphogenesis and significance of these ITI are not clearly understood, they have been found in several autoimmune and viral diseases, including infectious mononucleosis, a disease caused by EBV, and Burkitt's lymphoma, which is closely associated with EBV. Hence, the presence of ITI in NPC, another disease associated with EBV, seems to be of some significance. It is proposed that these inclusions could be the result of an immunological reaction initiated by injured cells infected with EBV, which acted as an antigen. The presence of another type of cytoplasmic inclusion, hitherto unknown, has also been reported.
