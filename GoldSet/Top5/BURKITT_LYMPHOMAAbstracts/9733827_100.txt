In this study, we investigated the induction of cellular gene expression by the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). Previously, LMP1 was shown to induce the expression of ICAM-1, LFA-3, CD40, and EBI3 in EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells and of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) in epithelial cells. We now show that LMP1 expression also increased Fas and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) in BL cells. LMP1 mediates NF-kappaB activation via two independent domains located in its C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a TRAF-interacting site that associates with TRAF1, -2, -3, and -5 through a PXQXT/S core motif and a TRADD-interacting site. In EBV-transformed B cells or transiently transfected BL cells, significant amounts of TRAF1, -2, -3, and -5 are associated with LMP1. In epithelial cells, very little TRAF1 is expressed, and only TRAF2, -3, and -5, are significantly complexed with LMP1. The importance of TRAF binding to the PXQXT/S motif in LMP1-mediated gene induction was studied by using an LMP1 mutant that contains alanine point mutations in this motif and fails to associate with TRAFs. This mutant, LMP1(P204A/Q206A), induced 60% of wild-type LMP1 NF-kappaB activation and had approximately 60% of wild-type LMP1 effect on Fas, ICAM-1, CD40, and LFA-3 induction. In contrast, LMP1(P204A/Q206A) was substantially more impaired in TRAF1, EBI3, and EGF-R induction. Thus, TRAF binding to the PXQXT/S motif has a nonessential role in up-regulating Fas, ICAM-1, CD40, and LFA-3 expression and a critical role in up-regulating TRAF1, EBI3, and EGF-R expression. Further, D1 LMP1, an LMP1 mutant that does not aggregate failed to induce TRAF1, EBI3, Fas, ICAM-1, CD40, and LFA-3 expression confirming the essential role for aggregation in LMP1 signaling. Overexpression of a dominant form of IkappaBalpha blocked LMP1-mediated TRAF1, EBI3, Fas, ICAM-1, CD40, and LFA-3 up-regulation, indicating that NF-kappaB is an important component of LMP1-mediated gene induction from both the TRAF- and TRADD-interacting sites.
