Interferon production was inhibited in the Namalwa line of human lymphoblastoid cells by treatment with 2-deoxy-D-glucose or D-glucosamine. D-Glucosamine also inhibited protein synthesis and the cells were no longer viable, whereas 2-deoxy-D-glucose allowed protein and RNA synthesis to continue at control rates, and the cells remained fully viable. It is concluded that a glycosylation step is essential for production of lymphoblastoid interferon.
