Homogenous deamidase AG from Pseudomonas fluorescens AG was found to be a glycoprotein with molecular weight of about 13,000 daltons. The molecule consists apparently of four similar or identic subunits with molecular weight of about 30,000 daltons. The amino acid composition, N-terminal amino acids, the amount of chymotryptic peptides, containing 14C-carboxymethyl cysteine were studied. The enzyme exhibited distinct antitumoral effect on cells of Burkitt's lymphoma, sensitive to asparaginase, but did not exhibit marked cytotoxic action on cells of human ovarium cancer CaOV line, resistant to asparaginases.
