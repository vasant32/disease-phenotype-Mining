We have generated in vitro lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells from healthy donors by stimulating their mononuclear leukocytes with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) (100 U/ml). After 6 days in culture, the lytic properties of the LAK cells were analyzed in the 51Cr-release assay by utilizing a target panel of 6 paired lines consisting of an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell line and an EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) from the same donor, the Raji BL line and the natural killer (NK) cell-sensitive K562 line. The patterns of lysis showed that the LAK cells discriminated between two categories of BL cell lines. Group I/II BL tumor cells which expressed the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA), the BL-associated glycolipid antigen (BLA) and phenotypically resembled biopsy cells were strongly lysed whereas group III BL cells which had assumed an LCL-like phenotype during culture and lacked the CALLA and BLA surface markers were only poorly lysed. The LCL targets were generally resistant to lysis but the K562 cell line was particularly sensitive. The outcome of cell depletion and monoclonal antibody (MAb) studies indicated that the LAK cell populations were phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous and consisted of at least 2 subpopulations of effector cells; a tumor-specific component and an NK-cell-mediated component.
