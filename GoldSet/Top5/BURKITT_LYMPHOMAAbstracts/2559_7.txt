EBV-neutralizing antibody titers were determined in 11 sera derived from African Burkitt lymphoma or nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients and in the corresponding serum fractions retained above XM 100 Diaflo membranes after low pH treatment, and after recombination of the retained and passed fractions by neutralization of the acidified samples. They were compared with the corresponding antimembrane antigen (MA) titers in seven of the same sera. While all sera tested showed substantial increase of the anti-MA activity in the retained fraction, resulting in a significantly increased mean titer, EBV neutralizing activity did not change at all after identical treatment or changed only in a random fashion, resulting in stable mean titers. It is suggested that anti-MA and neutralizing antibodies are directed against at least partly different antigens on the virus.
