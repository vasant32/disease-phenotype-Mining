Fifty-three patients in the pediatric age group diagnosed as having small non-cleaved follicular center cell (FCC) lymphoma (40 Burkitt's and 13 non-Burkitt's type) have been re-evaluated. Although the histopathologic distinction between the two subgroups is fairly easy to determine there is a considerable degree of clinical overlap in regard to age, sex, anatomic presentation of the disease, the incidence of bone marrow and central nervous system involvement, and the survival. The most important determinant of survival in both subgroups is the stage of the disease.
