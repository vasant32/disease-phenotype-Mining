We experienced a case of Burkitt's lymphoma showing an unusual surface phenotype, CD5 expression, at an early stage of the disease. Initially, this patient showed massive abdominal para-aortic lymph node swelling which rapidly developed into leukemic change. Based on the clinical course and cytogenetic features of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow, which showed t(8;14) and c-myc gene rearrangement, the patient was diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma. Combination chemotherapy induced short-term remission, but central nervous system (CNS) involvement developed, followed by a regrowth of lymphoma cells in the bone marrow. The bone marrow at the end stage showed monotonous expansion of large cells with conspicuous vacuolation in the basophilic cytoplasm. The initial lymphoma cells showed pan-B markers and were CD5 positive but weakly CD10 positive; however, the lymphoma cells obtained from the bone marrow at the terminal stage did not express CD5. The chromosomal t(8;14) was seen, and identical rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain joining gene and c-myc gene were detected by Southern blot analysis in the bone marrow lymphoblasts throughout the clinical course. This case is evidence that remarkable transformation of CD5-positive lymphoblasts to CD5-negative lymphoblasts occurred in an identical clone of Burkitt's lymphoma.
