Burkitt lymphomas (BLs) frequently show secondary chromosomal abnormalities. Here, the authors describe a case of BL with an unusual dual translocation of chromosome 14, t(8;14) and t(14;15), and partial duplication of 1q. This 5-yr-old female patient had several unfavorable prognostic factors including elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase activity and involvement of the central nervous system and bone marrow. Despite receiving CCG-106A chemotherapy, she was resistant to therapy and died on the 70th hospital day. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case report of BL harboring dual translocation of chromosome 14 involving chromosomes 8 and 15, which may be a factor associated with unfavorable clinical course.
