A 38-year-old man was referred by his dental surgeon with a painful swelling in the right mandibular sulcus and an ipsilateral numb lip. Dental infection secondary to caries was initially diagnosed but biopsy revealed this to be a Burkitt's lymphoma. After intense chemotherapy, the patient is still in remission three years later. This case is a reminder that malignancy should always be high on a clinician's list of differential diagnoses of jaw swelling associated with neurological abnormalities and prompt referral is essential.
