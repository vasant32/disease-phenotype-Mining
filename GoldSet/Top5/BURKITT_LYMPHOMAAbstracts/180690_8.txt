The cytoplasmic antigen was determined by the indirect immunofluorescence test using serum from a Burkitt lymphoma patient with a titer of antibody to Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen of 1.320, in the cytoplasm of 2--6% of cells of suspension cultures obtained from baboons with lymphoma. There was a correlation between the number of antigen-containing cells in this cultures and the number of cells in which herpes virus was determined by electron microscope studies. Sera from baboons with lymphoma from which the suspensions cultures had been prepared contained high titers of antibody to herpes virus of baboons (HVB) and to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Specific differences between the antigens produced in the cultures by HVB and EBV were minimal, indicating their immunological similarity. Lymphoblastoid cultures prepared from hemopoietic organs of baboons with lymphoma belong to B cell type.
