In contrast to other human tumors in which the c-myc gene and its transcript are greatly amplified, careful analysis of t(8;14) Burkitt cell lines indicates that the c-myc transcript is marginally, and in some cases not at all, increased by comparison to control lymphoblastoid cell lines. Instead, there is a more subtle alteration in the expression of the translocated c-myc gene characterized by a shift in promoter utilization and an apparent insensitivity to the regulation that inactivates the normal c-myc allele within these same cells. In some Burkitt cell lines, such deregulation might be because of the loss of a putative control region through removal of the large dual promoter/leader segment of the c-myc gene. In other cell lines, however, this deregulation may be explained by somatic mutations that occur within the putative control region even though it is located many hundreds of bases from the translocation breakpoint.
