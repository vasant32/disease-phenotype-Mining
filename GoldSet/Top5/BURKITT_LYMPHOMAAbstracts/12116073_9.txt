 BACKGROUND: The classification of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by specific chromosomal translocations may have prognostic implications. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is a useful tool for the detection of fusion transcript resulting from specific chromosomal translocation of the leukemic cells. In general, fusion transcripts are determined individually, a process which is labor intensive in order to detect all major fusion transcripts. PROCEDURE: We use a multiplex RT-PCR assay to detect both the CML- and ALL-type BCR-ABL transcripts of the t(9;22), all described variants of the E2A-PBX1 transcripts of t(1;19), the MLL-AF4 transcripts of t(4;11), and all described variants of TEL-AML1 (also termed ETV6-CBFA2) of the cryptic t(12;21) in 165 leukemic samples at diagnosis. RESULTS: The study yielded a completely concordant result with those obtained by the individual RT-PCR assay. In this cohort of Taiwan children, the relative frequencies of the four translocations of B-lineage ALL were as following: 6% with ALL-type t(9;22)/BCR-ABL, 7% t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1, 3% t(4;11)/MLL-AF4, and 18% t(12;21)/TEL-AML1, comparable to those in the Western countries. CONCLUSION: Multiplex RT-PCR assay is an efficient, sensitive, accurate, and cost-effective diagnostic tool, which will likely improve our ability in accurately and rapidly risk-stratifying children with ALL.
