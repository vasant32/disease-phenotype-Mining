A series of 69 cases of "large cell" non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphomas is reviewed. Based only on morphological criteria, eight groups of such lymphomas are described: four of them with a highly reproducible diagnosis and other four more difficult to compare with categories described by other authors. The importance of morphological classifications of malignant lymphomas is discussed.
