The BCL7A gene, which maps to human chromosome 12q24.13, was cloned through its direct involvement with MYC and IGH in a three-way translocation in a Burkitt lymphoma cell line. Here, we describe the identification of two related human genes, BCL7B and BCL7C, which share 90% identity to the amino-terminal 51 amino acids of human BCL7A, as well as 41% identity in the same region to Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Brugia malayi EST sequences. This degree of relatedness in the amino-terminal domain suggests we have defined a new gene family of unknown function. There was little sequence conservation between the family members outside this conserved domain and no identified protein motifs could be deduced. Human BCL7B and BCL7C mapped to chromosome 7q11.23, and 16p11, respectively. No chromosomal rearrangements affecting BCL7B or BCL7C were detected in lymphoid malignancies. BCL7B did, however, map within the region of 7q11.23 which is commonly deleted in the congenital disorder, Williams syndrome.
