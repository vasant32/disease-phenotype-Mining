An unusual case of Burkitt lymphoma presenting with an osteolytic pelvic lesion in a homosexual man with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is reported. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated unsuspected renal involvement and was used for guided percutaneous biopsy. The CT appearance of renal Burkitt lymphoma was similar to that of other types of renal lymphoma.
