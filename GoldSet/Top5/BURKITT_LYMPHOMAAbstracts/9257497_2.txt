Six patients, consisting of 4 males and 2 females with mean average age fo 29.20 years, with variable picture of multifocal choroiditis were serologically investigated for their association with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. IgG and IgM antibodies to EBV-Virus Capsid Antigen (VCA) were assayed by immunoperoxidase method on EBV infected lymphoblast cells (P3HR-1 Burkitt's lymphoma cell line). In these patients definite serological evidence of EBV infection with high titres of IgG and IgM antibodies to EBV-VCA was demonstrated suggestive of active continuing or persisting EBV infection.
