Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA synthesis following EBV P3HR-1 superinfection of the Burkitt lymphoma cell line, Daudi, is refractory to mitomycin C and hydroxyurea at concentrations which inhibit cell DNA synthesis to greater than 98% of control values. Further, neither mitomycin C nor hydroxyurea inhibit virus antigen synthesis following P3HR-1 superinfection.
