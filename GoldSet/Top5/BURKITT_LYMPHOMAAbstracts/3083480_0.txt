The double contrast enema is the most effective morphological screening method for the evaluation of the whole small bowel. Its sensitivity is 85%, its specifity 96.7%. In specific clinical problems the number of pathological roentgen findings rises: from 34.4% when all indications are taken into consideration to 58% in indications specific to the small intestine such as Morbus Crohn or the malabsorption syndrome. Search for tumours and the double contrast of the small bowel in unclear gastro-intestinal bleeding are unproductive. The weak point of this screening method is the lower part of the small intestine. Therefore, the selective peroral or retrograde analysis of the terminal ileum supplement the contrast method. A precondition for good results is an adequate technical standard. Besides the clinical results some technical results are therefore discussed such as contrast medium quantities, examination and X-ray time, radiation exposure and influences on the image quality.
