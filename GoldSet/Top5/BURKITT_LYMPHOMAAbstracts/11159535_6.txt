Following stress signals, the p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a critical role in regulation of cell proliferation, mainly through induction of growth arrest or apoptosis. Therefore, this protein needs to be strictly regulated and numerous studies have shown that the MDM2 protein is an essential element for p53 regulation in normal cells and, most importantly, that overexpression of MDM2 is responsible for p53 inactivation in various types of tumors. A previous study showed that this is the case in some Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cell lines, where enhanced translation of mdm2 messenger RNA results in overexpression of the protein that complexes and inactivates wild-type p53. To further investigate the role of the p53/MDM2 complex in these BL cells, as well as in other lymphoid cells that do not overexpress MDM2, this study used antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed either against mdm2 or against p53. Results show that the mdm2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide induces apoptosis of cells that express a high or low level of MDM2 protein, only if they contain wild-type p53. Moreover, apoptosis is independent of the accumulation of p53 following mdm2 antisense treatment. Finally, the p53 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, which inhibits the expression of wild-type p53, also induces a decrease of the MDM2 level in cells, whether or not they overexpress this protein, and causes apoptosis of these cells. These results indicate that decreasing the MDM2 protein level by directly or indirectly targeting its biosynthesis is a potent tool for the induction of apoptosis.
