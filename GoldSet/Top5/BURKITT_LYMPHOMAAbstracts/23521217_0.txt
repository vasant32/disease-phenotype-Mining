Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive B-cell lymphoma including 2 forms of BL differing in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection status: EBV-positive and EBV-negative BL. Recent years, although many efforts, such as high-intensity, short-duration combination chemotherapy, have been devoted to improve therapy for this rapidly proliferating neoplasm, there are still significant treatment-associated toxicities. Therefore, there remains a need for novel effective therapeutic strategies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a role of "fine tuning" in the physiological and pathological differentiation process, by which cells can rapidly regulate dynamic events such as cell-lineage decisions and morphogenesis. This unique miRNA feature shifts the traditional one drug target paradigm to a novel one drug multiple targets paradigm. Here, we found that BL cell lines exhibited an extremely low expression of miR-150, and then restored miR-150 expression at physiologic levels in BL cell lines, i.e. Daudi, Raji, BJAB and Ramos. The results showed that re-expression of miR-150 reduced proliferation of Daudi and Raji cells. Furthermore, Daudi and Raji, both of which are EBV-positive germinal center B-cell (GC B) origin, transduced with miR-150 can be rescued to differentiate toward B-cell terminal stage. However, no significant changes were observed in BJAB and Ramos cells which are EBV-negative GC B origin. Of note, re-expression of miR-150 also resulted in decreasing c-Myb protein levels. Additionally, c-Myb knockdown in Daudi and Raji cell lines recapitulated the partial characteristics similar to that caused by re-expression of miR-150. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that miR-150 can induce EBV-positive BL differentiation by targeting c-Myb.
