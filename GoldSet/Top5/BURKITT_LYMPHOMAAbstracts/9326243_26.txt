In the hematopoietic system CD77, a glycolipid surface antigen, is restricted to group I Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines and a subset of germinal center B lymphocytes. Recently, we have reported that recombinant B subunits of Verotoxin, which specifically binds to CD77, induce programmed cell death of CD77+ BL cells. Here, we show that an anti-CD77 monoclonal antibody (38.13) immobilized on tissue culture dishes also induces apoptosis, and we have explored the signal transducing events leading to this cell death. We show that ligation of CD77 antigen causes an increase of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration owing to an influx of extracellular Ca2+ through calcium channels. Chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA partially prevents anti-CD77-induced apoptosis, indicating that this process is probably Ca2+ dependent. We show that the cross-linking of CD77 provokes an increase of intracellular cAMP levels followed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation. We report that BL cells produce ceramide when they are exposed to 38.13 but, unexpectedly, without a concomitant decrease in sphingomyelin or CD77 content. Finally, we provide evidence that C2-ceramide, calcium ionophore, and forskolin (which increases intracellular levels of cAMP) independently induce apoptosis of CD77+ BL cells and, moreover, that C2-ceramide and forskolin strongly synergize to cause cell death. The possible role of CD77-mediated apoptosis in the B cell selection that occurs in germinal centers is discussed.
