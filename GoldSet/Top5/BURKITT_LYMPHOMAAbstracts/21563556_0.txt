 PROBLEMS/OBJECTIVES: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is commonly associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Burkitt's lymphoma, but association with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal tumours is rare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of an EBV-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the hypopharynx. METHODOLOGY: A 63-year-old male patient suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with swallowing disorders and a sore throat. Panendoscopy with laser surgical resection of tissue specimens was performed. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical and molecular genetic diagnostics, including EBV-encoded small RNA in situ hybridization, confirmed the diagnosis of an EBV-associated DLBCL of the hypopharynx. Ten weeks after the diagnosis, the patient died of disease related to multiple complications. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the EBV infection was triggered by long-term immunosuppressive therapy that led secondarily to the development of a DLBCL. Otorhinolaryngologists should keep in mind that lymphomas might develop in the entire pharynx.
