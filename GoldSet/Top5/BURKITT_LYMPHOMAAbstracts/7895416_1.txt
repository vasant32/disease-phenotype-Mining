To elucidate the genetic origins of human B-cell lymphomas, we have used northern analysis to establish the profile of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (VH) gene utilization in 14 Burkitt's and 10 large cell lymphomas. Our results indicate that the pattern of VH gene subgroup expression in these tumors is similar to the distribution of VH subgroups utilized in the normal repertoire of adult peripheral blood B cells. This finding suggests that these 2 types of lymphomas originate from a relatively diverse population of B cells and that antigenic drive, at least by a single antigen species, does not represent a major etiologic factor in the genesis of this class of B-cell neoplasms. However, the utilization of genes from the VH3 subgroup by 65% of the lymphomas examined in this study raises the possibility that antibodies directed against conserved VH3 subgroup determinant(s) may be of value in treating at least some affected individuals.
