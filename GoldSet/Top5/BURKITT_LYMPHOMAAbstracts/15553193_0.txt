A 12-week-old greyhound had a two-day history of lethargy, inappetence and shifting lameness. Clinical examination revealed pyrexia and hepatosplenomegaly. Haematological examination showed anaemia, thrombocytopenla, neutropenla and large numbers of atypical mononuclear leucocytes. A diagnosis of acute B cell lymphoblastic leukaemia was made following flow cytometric immunophenotyping of the leucocytes. The owner declined further evaluation and the dog was treated symptomatically with antibiotics. After a brief improvement, the dog's condition deteriorated and it was euthanased four days after initial presentation. The case was unusual because acute lymphoid leukaemia in the dog is most frequently reported in mature animals. This is in contrast to humans, where acute leukaemia is one of the most common childhood cancers.
