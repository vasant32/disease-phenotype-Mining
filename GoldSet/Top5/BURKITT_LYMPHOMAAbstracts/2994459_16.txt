This case report describes a case of chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection resulting in lymphadenopathy morphologically indistinguishable from Hodgkin's disease. Morphologic, immunologic, and virologic studies could be performed on three consecutive lymph nodes. For the first time in the literature, Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen (EBNA) could be demonstrated in the nuclei of Sternberg-Reed cells.
