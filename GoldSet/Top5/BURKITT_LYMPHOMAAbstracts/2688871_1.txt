The present investigation demonstrates that leukoregulin, a cytokine secreted by natural killer (NK) lymphocytes up-regulates the sensitivity of tumor cells to lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell cytotoxicity. It has been previously established that leukoregulin increases the sensitivity of sarcoma, carcinoma and leukemia cells to natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. Tumor cells were treated with leukoregulin for 1 h at 37 degrees C and tested for sensitivity to NK and LAK cytotoxicity in a 4-h chromium-release assay. NK-resistant Daudi, QGU and C4-1 human cervical carcinoma cells became sensitive to NK cytotoxicity after leukoregulin treatment, and their sensitivity to LAK was increased two- to sixfold. Y-79 retinoblastoma cells, which are moderately sensitive to NK and very sensitive to LAK, became increasingly sensitive (two- to four-fold) to both NK and LAK cell cytotoxicity. Recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), recombinant interleukin-1 (alpha and beta), recombinant interferon gamma, recombinant tumor necrosis factor or combinations of the latter two failed to up-regulate tumor cell sensitivity to NK and LAK cell cytotoxicity. However, treatment with recombinant interferon gamma for 16-18 h, GM-CSF and interleukin-1 beta for 1 h induced a state of target cell resistance to both NK and LAK cell cytotoxicity. Leukoregulin may have an important physiological function in modulating NK and LAK cell cytotoxicity by increasing the sensitivity of target cells to these natural cellular immunocytotoxicity mechanisms.
