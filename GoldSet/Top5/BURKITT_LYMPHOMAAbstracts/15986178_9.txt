The telomere repeat lengths of BL cell lines were quantified by measuring terminal restriction fragment (TRF). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive Namalwa, Raji, and EB-3 cell lines have long telomeres, i.e. TRFs 10-19 kbp, whereas the Daudi cell line, producing a transformation-defective EBV mutant, has TRFs approximately 2.2 kbp. EBV-negative BJAB and DG75 cell lines have short TRFs 3.9-5.4 kbp, shorter than the approximately 12 kbp TRFs in PBLs. Telomerase activities of these BL cell lines are similar. TRFs of non-BL lymphoma cell lines are 2.3-5.5 kbp. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies of these cell lines showed remarkable heterogeneity of telomere size in chromosomes in the same BL cell. These results suggest that EBV-positive and EBV-negative BL cell lines have experienced various telomere dynamics.
