CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 43-year-old patient with a Burkitt lymphoma in the small intestine, who initially presented with abdominal discomfort, weight loss, constipation and neurological symptoms. DIAGNOSIS: In terms of differential diagnosis other inflammatory and tumorous diseases had to be considered. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are common malignant afflictions of the GI-tract. The total body tumor burden is the principal determinant of prognosis. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is one parameter that reflects the tumor burden. On the other hand abdominal mass, bone marrow and central nervous system involvement are negative prognostic factors. Lymphomas can invade in the CNS at any time during the course of disease. This is generally associated with a poor prognosis if not treated immediately. TREATMENT: High doses of cyclophosphamid and MTX have been shown successful in the treatment of Burkitt lymphoma. Almost all relapses occur on therapy or shortly after termination of treatment. Therefore, criteria are needed to select patients of higher and lesser risk to protect the latter from the further intensification of therapy.
