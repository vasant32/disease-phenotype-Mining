Necessary for growth and differentiation in many normal tissues and capable of inducing differentiation in human promyelocytic cell lines, retinoids were the subject of this study. Specifically, effects of 13-cis-retinoic acid and 13-trans-retinoic acid on the growth of normal human bone marrow cells in soft-agar system were studied. Both short-term incubation and continuous exposure to retinoic acid caused a decreased number of granulocyte colonies and an increased cluster-to-colony ratio. This effect was concentration-dependent. Examination of specimens stained with Wright-Giemsa or nitro blue tetrazolium stains showed a progressive increase in the percentage of immature granulocytic precursors with increasing concentrations of retinoic acid. No effect of retinoic acid was seen on a number of human tumor cell lines. Retinoic acid blocked both differentiation and proliferation and appeared to do so by specific, noncytotoxic mechanisms in normal human bone marrow cells.
