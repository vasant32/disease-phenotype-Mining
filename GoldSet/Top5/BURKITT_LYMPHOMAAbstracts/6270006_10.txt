Superinfection of lymphoblastoid cells of EBV non-producer lines with non-transforming P3HR-1 EBV leads to the rescue of transforming virus. At least part of the recovered molecules represent recombinant DNA between superinfecting P3HR-1 EBV and resident viral genomes (Fresen et al., 1979, 1980). With high titer stocks of superinfecting P3HR-1 EBV, viral particles with early antigen (EA)-inducing properties can be rescued, indicating that under these conditions of infection input viral genomes may become replicated. Sequential blot analysis with 32P-P3HR1-EBV DNA of intracellular viral DNA synthesized following infection reveals a multiplicity-dependent pattern. High particle inputs lead to preferential synthesis of certain fragments, independent of infection of either EBV genome-free or EBV genome carrier cells. This accumulation of specific viral sequences indicates defective replication of P3HR-1 EBV DNA.
