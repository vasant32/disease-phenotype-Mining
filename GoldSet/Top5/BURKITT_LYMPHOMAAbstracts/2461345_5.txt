CR2, the receptor for the C3d fragment of the third complement component and for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been shown, on mouse B cells, to be involved in the control of B-cell proliferation by acting as a receptor for macrophage-derived growth factors. We examined whether the growth of a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, RAJI, could be influenced by ligands of human CR2. In serum-free culture, purified human C3d, as well as three monoclonal antibodies to distinct epitopes on human CR2, were capable of enhancing the growth rate of RAJI cells two to five-fold. This effect could not be observed if even trace amounts of serum were present in the culture medium. Simultaneous addition of pairs of antibodies did not enhance the growth rate, suggesting that a particular engagement of CR2 may be critical in order to induce a stimulatory effect. These results indicate that in a homologous serum-free human B-cell system human C3d as well as monoclonal antibodies to human CR2 can induce B-cell proliferation and that CR2-mediated triggering of B cells can be induced via epitopes other than the C3d-binding site. In addition we conclude that--unlike normal human B cells--at least some human B-lymphoma cells respond to CR2-mediated stimuli in the absence of any T-cell derived factors. Therefore the control mechanisms exerted through CR2 must still be intact on these autonomously growing cells.
