We have performed DNA analysis by means of fluorescence-activated cell cytometry on paraffin-embedded tissue from the diagnostic biopsy specimens in 40 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 25 of Hodgkin's disease (HD) and from 50 normal tonsils as controls. For HD cases, aneuploidy was found in 7 of 25 (28%), a higher proportion than in two previous studies of mainly adult patients. Diploid tumors showed S-phase fractions (SPFs) similar to those of controls. In the NHL cases aneuploidy was found in 12 of 40 (30%) with no significant association with site, stage, histopathology, immunophenotype, or prognosis. SPFs were highest in abdominal and chest primary sites but were not related to stage. Burkitt's lymphomas had the highest SPFs relative to lymphoblastic (P < .01) and centroblastic lymphomas (P < .05). Significantly higher SPFs were found in B cell than in T cell tumors (P < .001). There was considerable heterogeneity for SPFs within each NHL subgroup. Survival was worse at 5 years for those with high SPFs compared with those with normal SPFs (P = .04). These results suggest that tumor DNA analysis may be useful in the evaluation of children with NHL. Larger studies are needed to define its role as an independent prognostic variable.
