Although cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a neoplastic helper T-cell disorder of unknown etiology, prolonged antigenic stimulation has been postulated to contribute to the development of this disease. Because Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection has been associated with several different lymphomas, the sera of 21 CTCL patients were examined for antibodies to EBV antigens. By using complement immunofluorescence (CIF) techniques, 13 of 21 CTCL patients had detectable antibodies to Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigens (EBNA), whereas only five of 20 control psoriatic patients were CIF positive. When immunoblot analysis was employed, all 21 of the CTCL patients had antibodies to the EBV antigens, EBNA, whereas only 12 of the control patients had detectable antibodies to these antigens. In addition, three of 21 CTCL patients had antibodies to the EBV-associated antigen, rheumatoid arthritis nuclear antigen (RANA), as determined by double immunodiffusion, whereas none of the control sera contained anti-RANA antibodies. These results indicate that antibodies against EBV antigens are found with a higher frequency and concentration in patients with CTCL when compared to controls and suggest that EBV products might serve as a possible stimulus for the development of this malignant disease.
