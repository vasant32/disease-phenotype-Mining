Effective autologous bone marrow transplantation for leukemia and lymphoma is likely to depend upon the selective removal in vitro of malignant cells from normal human bone marrow precursors. Highly specific cytotoxic conjugates formed by coupling ricin A chain to monoclonal antibodies might prove useful for the selective elimination of malignant cells. Consequently, ricin A chain conjugates have been prepared with several different murine monoclonal antibodies and tested for their ability to eliminate clonogenic Burkitt's lymphoma cells from an excess of human bone marrow. The most active reagents included an antibody:A chain conjugate which bound to the nonpolymorphic chain of the la molecule and another which reacted with the mu heavy chain of cell surface immunoglobulin. Conjugates formed with anti-common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen, anti-Mr 26,000 glycoprotein, and anti-B1 were much less active on these Burkitt's cells, contrasting with results of complement-dependent tumor cell lysis. Tumor cell kill was partially inhibited by the addition of greater than 2 X 10(6) human bone marrow cells/ml but could be potentiated by increasing the concentration of conjugate or by the addition of 10 mM ammonium chloride. In the presence of ammonium chloride, at least 4 logs of clonogenic tumor cells could be eliminated within 24 h from a 20-fold excess of bone marrow using 10(-7) M ricin A chain linked to one or two different antibodies. Similar treatment of normal human bone marrow temporarily inhibited granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (cell) formation but did not compromise establishment of continuous bone marrow cultures. The degree of selective elimination of tumor cells with A chain antibody conjugates was comparable to that achieved with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide or with multiple monoclonal antibodies and complement.
