Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL) have poor prognosis despite intensive therapeutic intervention. Recently, imatinib, a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been proven to be an effective treatment for Ph(+) ALL, but nearly all patients rapidly acquire resistance. High-dose imatinib administration might overcome this resistance; however, systemic toxicities would likely limit this approach. Therefore, a new delivery system allowing for the specific targeting of imatinib is urgently needed. Because almost all Ph(+) ALL cells express CD19 on their surface, we have developed an immunoliposome carrying anti-CD19 antibody (CD19-liposomes). The internalization efficiency of the CD19-liposomes approached 100% in all Ph(+) ALL cells but was very low in CD19(-) cells. The cytocidal effect of imatinib-encapsulated CD19-liposomes (imatinib-CD19-liposomes) on Ph(+) ALL cell lines and primary leukemia cells from patients with Ph(+) ALL was much greater than that of imatinib with or without control liposomes. Importantly, the imatinib-CD19-liposomes did not affect the colony formation of CD34(+) hematopoietic cells, even at inhibitory concentration of free imatinib. Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate that the imatinib-CD19-liposomes induced specific and efficient death of Ph(+) ALL cells. This new therapeutic approach might be a useful treatment for Ph(+) ALL with fewer side effects than free imatinib.
