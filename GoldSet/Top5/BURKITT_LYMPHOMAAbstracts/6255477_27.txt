Sera from healthy individuals and patients with infectious mononucleosis, Burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or other malignancies were examined for their capacity to neutralize Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced DNase activity. Sera were found that neutralized the EBV DNase but not herpes simplex virus type 1 or type 2 DNases, and vice versa. Sera from 46 of the 49 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma examined (94%) neutralized > 6 units of EBV DNase per ml of serum. In contrast, only 19% of 47 patients with Burkitt lymphoma, 12% of 183 patient with other malignancies, 4% of 58 patients with infectious mononucleosis, and none of 101 healthy individuals had such levels of neutralizing activity. The neutralizing factor was found in the IgG fraction derived from nasopharyngeal carcinoma sera. There was no correlation between the concentration of these antibodie and the titers of IgG ad IgA antibodies to the EBV capsid antigen, the early antigen complex, or the EBV-associated nuclear antigen.
