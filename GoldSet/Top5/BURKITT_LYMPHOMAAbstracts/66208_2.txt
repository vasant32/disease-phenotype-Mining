Three groups of EBV antigens, VCA, MA and EA, were compared by the techniques of electron microscopic immunoperoxidase (IP) and immunofluorescence (IF). P3HR-1 and EBV superinfected Raji cells served as targets for labelled sera from patients with BL, NPC and IM or from healthy donors. 125I peroxidase-labelled antibodies were also prepared to determine, autoradiographically, the penetration of the complex into the cell system, and to monitor the incubation and washing procedures. The development of a gentle sedimentation technique proved critical in handling the fragile target cells. VCA and MA were readily identified and localized by both procedures without significant modification of the basic techniques. Indentification of early antigens by IP required modification of the fixation method to include a brief treatment in acetone. The diffuse early antigen (EAD) was found to be associated with cellular ribosomes.
