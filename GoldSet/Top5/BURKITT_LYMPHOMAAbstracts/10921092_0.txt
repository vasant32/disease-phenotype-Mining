OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics of acute leukemia (AL) in the elderly in Shanghai. METHODS: Four hundred and seventeen elderly ALs registered in SLCG between 1984 and 1994 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Elderly AL accounted for 14.5% of all AL, AML was the major type, and M5 and L3 were the commonest subtypes. Complete remission rate of elderly AL was 23.9%, which was lower than that of young adults'(53.7%). Routine dose induction chemotherapy was more effective than low dose chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors for early death were age > or = 70, hemoglobin < 40 g/L, bone marrow blast cell > 80%, DIC presentation, secondary to MDS, or other conditions such as heart or pulmonary diseases.
