The nucleotide sequence of a translocated c-myc gene in a Burkitt lymphoma reveals multiple base changes in the coding region. Twenty-five base changes, generating 16 codon alterations, were found in the first coding exon; no changes occur in the second coding exon. These changes are probably the result of somatic mutations that occurred during and after translocation, and may contribute to oncogenesis by allowing synthesis of an altered c-myc gene product.
