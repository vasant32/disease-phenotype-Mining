EBV-transformed B lymphocyte cell lines can generate superoxide, using an electron transport chain homologous, or even identical, to phagocytic NADPH-oxidase. We searched for normal, not virally transformed, B lymphocytes with analogous properties, using tonsils as the source of B cells. Unseparated tonsillar leukocytes contained cells capable of PMA-triggered superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT+ cells) well in excess of phagocytes (18.9 +/- 6.4% NBT+ cells with 1.3 +/- 0.9% granulocytes and 1.9 +/- 2.3% monocytes/macrophages, n = 8). NBT reduction was also inhibited by diphenylene iodonium, a selective inhibitor of phagocytic NADPH-oxidase. Cross-linking of surface Ig was equally effective as PMA in inducing NBT reduction among tonsillar leukocytes. NBT+ cells co-distributed with B cells on Percoll density gradients and were enriched among purified B cells obtained by SRBC rosetting twice and Sephadex G10 adherence (47.8 +/- 15.2% NBT+ cells among 90.5 +/- 5.5% B cells, 4.8 +/- 5.1% T cells, 1.2 +/- 0.77% monocytes/macrophages, and 0.73 +/- 0.6% granulocytes, n = 10). Further, mAb 7D5, directed against an extracellularly located epitope of the small subunit of cytochrome b-245 of phagocytes, stained the majority of tonsillar B cells (85 +/- 9.2% 7D5+ cells and 91.6 +/- 4.04% B cells, n = 3). Superoxide production, staining with 7D5 antibody, and expression of mRNA for the beta chain of cytochrome b-245 were further analyzed in cell lines. The EBV-BLCL F1 and the Burkitt lymphoma P3HR-1 both carried 7D5-detectable cytochrome b-245 Ag and expressed mRNA for the beta chain of the cytochrome b, both in similar amounts. However, only F1, not P3HR-1, was capable of PMA-triggered superoxide production. These data indicate that also normal nontransformed B lymphocytes possess the capacity to generate superoxide by a system apparently similar to phagocytic NADPH-oxidase, provisionally termed "B cell oxidase." Discrepancies observed in certain B cells and lines between expression of cytochrome b components and stimulus-induced superoxide production may be related to an absence or low level of other oxidase components or of the signal transduction mechanism. Conceivably, production of superoxide and derived reactive oxygen species by B cells may have cytotoxic, immunomodulatory, or mutagenic effects on the B cells themselves or on cells in their immediate vicinity.
