The histopathologic changes of bone marrow during infection with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are described. Bone marrow biopsies from 73 patients at different stages of HIV-1 infection were studied. Indications for biopsy included peripheral blood abnormalities, suspicion of lymphoma, or search for specific pathogens. Common histopathological features, suggestive of HIV-1 infection but nonpathognomonic were hypercellularity (67%), myelodysplasia (86.1%), plasmacytosis (98.6%), lymphocytic infiltration (31.1%) and histiocytic infiltration with or without granulomata (13.7%). Increases in reticulin fibers (54.7%), and stainable iron deposits, vascular congestion and serous atrophy of fat were frequent features. Opportunistic infections and neoplastic complications were detected in 7 cases: pathogens were demonstrated in 4 cases (Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI), Cryptococcus neoformans, Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania) and lymphoma in 3 cases (1 Burkitt lymphoma and 2 Hodgkin's disease). Bone marrow hypoplasia is usually a terminal event in AIDS and may be iatrogenic.
