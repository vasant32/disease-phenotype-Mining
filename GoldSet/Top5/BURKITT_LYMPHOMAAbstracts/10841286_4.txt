OBJECTIVE: To see how arsenic trioxide (As2O3) affects proliferation of the human B lymphoma cell line MBC-1. METHODS: We studied the effect of As2O3 on MBC-1 cells and its mechanism by morphological observation, flow cytometry assay and DNA gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: As2O3 could upregulate p53 gene expression at protein level, inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting the proliferation of MBC-1 cells. Upregulation of p53 expression appears to be important in the apoptosis of MBC-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: As2O3 can inhibit the proliferation of MBC-1 cells by upregulating p53 gene expression, thus inducing apoptosis.
