In 1974, a 28-year-old man presented with a 12 cm sized ulcerated tumor involving the middle third of the stomach, which was originally diagnosed as "lymphosarcoma". Clinical recurrence of the lymphoma resulted in rapidly progressing disease and the patient died 4 months after initial diagnosis. Retrospective work-up of the 29-year-old tumor blocks revealed the typical histologic appearance and phenotype (CD20, CD10, BCL-6 positive) of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) with a proliferation rate of 95%. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). the tumor cells were shown to harbor an IGH-MYC fusion indicating the presence of the hallmark Burkitt-translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32). Considering the typical clinical features of BL requiring appropriate treatment regimes the case presented here highlights the importance of modern histopathologic and molecular cytogenetic techniques for the proper classification of such rare lymphomas presenting at atypical sites.
