The antiproliferative effect of clinically promising interferon inducers, phage f2 ambermutant dsRNA, polyguacyl, tiloron, Tash-4, was demonstrated in Raji lymphoblastoid cells. Concentrations of the inducers producing death of 48-66% of Raji cells were determined to be: for dsRNA, 200 micrograms/ml; polyguacyl, 400 micrograms/ml; tiloron, 100 micrograms/ml; Tash-4, 200 micrograms/ml, which corresponded to the antiproliferative effect of 200 units/ml of alpha-interferon and 40 units/ml of gamma-interferon. No antiproliferative effect was observed at dsRNA, polyguacyl, and Tash-4 concentrations below 100 micrograms/ml. None of the inducers exerted the antiproliferative effect on the selected concentrations on normal human diploid cells. The results obtained explain the antitumorigenic effect of these inducers, demonstrated previously.
