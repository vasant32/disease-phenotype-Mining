Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), a latent viral protein consistently expressed in infected proliferating cells, is essentially required in trans to maintain EBV episomes in cells. We constructed a mutant (mt) EBNA1 and examined whether it exerted dominant-negative effects on maintenance of the viral episome thereby leading to abrogation of EBV-infected tumor cell growth. Using lymphocyte and epithelial cell lines converted with neomycin-resistant recombinant EBV (rEBV) as models, adenovirus vector-mediated transduction of mtEBNA1, but not LacZ, brought about rapid and striking reductions in rEBV-derived wild-type EBNA1 levels and viral genomic loads in converted lines of three major viral latencies. This outcome was further validated at the single-cell level by cellular loss of G418 resistance and viral signals in situ. The mtEBNA1 transduction significantly impaired growth of naturally EBV-harboring Burkitt lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo, largely in association with the eradication of viral episomes. Expression of mtEBNA1 per se caused no detectable cytotoxicity in EBV-uninfected cells. These results indicate that mtEBNA1 can act as a dominant-negative effector that efficiently impedes the EBV-dependent malignant phenotypes in cells regardless of viral latency or tissue origin. The mutant will afford an additional therapeutic strategy specifically targeting EBV-associated malignancies.
