L-asparaginase (EC 3.5.1.1) was purified to homogeneity from Thermus thermophilus. The apparent molecular mass of L-asparaginase was found to be 33 kDa by SDS-PAGE, whereas by Sephacryl S-300 superfine column it was found to be 200 kDa, indicating that the enzyme in the native stage acts as hexamer. It is a thermostable enzyme and keeps all of its activity at 80 degrees C for 10 min. The antiproliferative activity of the purified L-asparaginase from T. thermiphilus was tested against the following human cell lines: K-562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), Raji (Burkitt's lymphoma), SK-N-MC (primitive neuroectodermal tumor), HeLa (cervical cancer), BT20 and MCF7 (breast cancers), HT-29 (human colon cancer), and OAW-42 (ovarian cancer). The antiproliferative activity of T. thermophilus enzyme was compared with Erwinase, the commercially available L-asparaginase from Erwinia corotovora. The potency difference between the two L-asparaginases was greater in HeLa and SK-N-MC than in other cell lines. The fact that L-asparaginase from T. thermophilus does not hydrolyse L-glutamine makes it advantageous for future clinical trials.
