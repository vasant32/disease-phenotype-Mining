In most human Burkitt's lymphomas, translocation of the myc oncogene to an immunoglobulin locus is associated with loss of myc exon 1 or with mutations near its 3' border, a region where myc transcription is attenuated and translation of a larger myc polypeptide initiates. Emu-myc transgenic mice, which bear the three myc exons coupled to an immunoglobulin enhancer, provide a model for the development of such lymphomas, because their lymphomagenesis appears to require events other than expression of the transgene. To determine whether myc rearrangement or exon 1 mutation is a necessary tumorigenic event, we examined the transgene structure and myc exon 1 sequences in Emu-myc B lymphoid tumours. Southern blots revealed no transgene rearrangements in 20 of the lymphomas, and only two tumours showed amplification (2 to 5-fold). To search for exon 1 alterations, the exon 1 mRNA region was amplified from five tumours by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced, but no mutations were found. Hence, neither excision nor mutation of exon 1 is necessary to render myc tumorigenic. The sequence analysis across the exon 1-exon 2 boundary unexpectedly revealed an ambiguity in myc splicing that predicts a variant form of the larger myc polypeptide lacking a single amino acid residue.
