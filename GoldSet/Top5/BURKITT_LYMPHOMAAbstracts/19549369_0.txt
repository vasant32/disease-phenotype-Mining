The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of ZnPcH(1)-PDT on the lymphoma cells and its mechanism. Human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line CA46 and mouse lymphoma cell line P388 were selected as objects for study. The killing effect of ZnPcH(1)-PDT on cells were assessed by MTT method and colony formation assay; the cell death patterns were analyzed by AO/EB fluorescence stain, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), DNA ladder assay; and the different proportions of each death pattern were determined by Annexin-V(-FITC)/PI double stains. The results showed that ZnPcH(1)-PDT displayed anti-proliferation effect on both CA46 cells and P388 cells in dose-dependent manner. CA46 cells were less sensitive to PDT than P388 cells (p < 0.05). Furthermore, PDT could induce cell apoptosis in time-dependent manner. The rate of cell apoptosis increased in the PDT-treated cells. The results of Annexin-V(-FITC)/PI stain indicated that early apoptosis was the main death pattern in the PDT-treated CA46 cells, while early apoptosis and necrosis were the main death model in the PDT-treated P388 cells. It is concluded that ZnPcH(1)-PDT can effectively inhibit lymphoma cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis.
