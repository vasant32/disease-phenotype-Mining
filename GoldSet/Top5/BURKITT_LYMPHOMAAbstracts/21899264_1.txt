The in vitro reactivity of capsanthin (1) and fucoxanthin (2) with peroxynitrite was investigated, and the reaction products produced by scavenging with peroxynitrite were analyzed. (14'Z)-Nitrocapsanthin (3) and 12-nitrocapsanthin (4) were isolated from the products of the reaction of capsanthin with peroxynitrite. Similarly, (14Z)-15-nitrofucoxanthin (5), (11Z)-11-nitrofucoxanthin (6), and (14Z,9'Z)-15-nitrofucoxanthin (7) were obtained from the reaction of peroxynitrite reaction with fucoxanthin. Capsanthin and fucoxanthin inhibited the nitration of tyrosine by peroxynitrite. Furthermore, nitrocapsanthins (3 and 4) and nitrofucoxanthins (5 and 6) exhibited an inhibitory effect on Epstein-Barr virus early antigen activation in Raji cells and an antiproliferative effect on human pancreatic carcinoma. Moreover, nitrocapsanthins (3 and 4) inhibited carcinogensis of mouse skin tumors initiated by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBN).
