Capillary electrophoresis is applied to determine nucleotide pool levels in human Burkitt lymphoma cells. The analysis was performed on a 65 cm x 50 microns I.D. Ucon-coated column with on-column UV detector. The method requires only nanoliters of sample and a simple sample preparation procedure. Over 12 nucleotides were separated and quantitated with high resolution and reproducibility. The whole capillary electrophoretic separation time was only 35 min. These results demonstrate that capillary electrophoresis provides a useful and easy way to analyze nucleotide pools in cells.
