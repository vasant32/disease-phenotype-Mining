This is a report of a case of retinoblastoma that mimicked Burkitt's lymphoma by presenting with a left proptosis and a right cheek mass. With the aid of fine-needle aspiration cytology, the diagnosis was established as retinoblasstoma and a left modified exenteration was performed. The patient had adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy to the left orbit and the right maxilla with regression. At 12 months postoperatively, there was no evidence of recurrence, and the patient was still hale and hearty. In conclusion, this patient had left retinoblastoma with metastasis to the contralateral jaw. It is important to note that orbital Burkitt's lymphoma can be a differential diagnosis of retinoblastoma.
