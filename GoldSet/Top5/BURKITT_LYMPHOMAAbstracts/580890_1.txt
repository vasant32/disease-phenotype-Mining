A 3-year-old boy was admitted with an orbital apex syndrome that histologically was proven to be an undifferentiated lymphosarcoma. He subsequently developed systemic multifocal extranodal involvement and died eight months later. Clinical findings were consistent with those seen in Burkitt's lymphoma. Some, but not all, of the cytologic findings were characteristic of Burkitt's lymphoma.
