Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a potential complication characterized by hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia due to massive necrosis of malignant cells after cytotoxic therapy. This fatal complication occurs frequently in tumors with hematological malignancies, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Burkitt's lymphoma, and in other tumors with high proliferative rates and tumor burdens. TLS is rarely associated with the treatment of solid tumors. Herein, we report a case of TLS following the initial administration of effective chemotherapy for an epithelioid leiomyosarcoma with focal rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation of the uterus.
