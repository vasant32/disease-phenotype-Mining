14 patients (12 men, 2 women, mean age 26.3 [15-47] years) with histologically confirmed Burkitt's lymphoma were subjected between 1984 and 1989 to chemotherapy originally developed for treating lymphomas in children. Treatment consisted of medium doses of methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, teniposide, cytarabine, adriamycin and prednisone, intrathecal administration of methotrexate and if necessary prophylactic or therapeutic irradiation of the cranium. Most of the patients (64%) were in advanced stages of the disease. The rate of complete remissions was 100%. Four patients (29%) had a recurrence. Side effects were leukopenia (WHO grade III and IV) in 71%, grade III anaemia in 43% and grade III-IV thrombopenia in 29% of the patients. Considerable mucositides in 5 of the 14 patients (36%), and in one case a tumour lysis syndrome with transient renal insufficiency were other therapy-induced side effects. These results suggest that this treatment course can be successful also in non-endemic Burkitt's lymphoma in adolescents and adults.
