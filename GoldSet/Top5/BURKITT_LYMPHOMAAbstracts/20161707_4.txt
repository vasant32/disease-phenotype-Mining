 BACKGROUND: Non-coding RNAs have critical functions in diverse biological processes, particularly in gene regulation. Viruses, like their host cells, employ such functional RNAs and the human cancer associated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is no exception. Nearly all EBV associated tumours express the EBV small, non-coding RNAs (EBERs) 1 and 2, however their role in viral pathogenesis remains largely obscure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To investigate the action of EBER1 in vivo, we produced ten transgenic mouse lines expressing EBER1 in the lymphoid compartment using the mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain intronic enhancer Emicro. Mice of several of these EmicroEBER1 lines developed lymphoid hyperplasia which in some cases proceeded to B cell malignancy. The hallmark of the transgenic phenotype is enlargement of the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes and in some cases enlargement of the thymus, liver and peripheral lymph nodes. The tumours were found to be of B cell origin and showed clonal IgH rearrangements. In order to explore if EBER1 would cooperate with c-Myc (deregulated in Burkitt's lymphoma) to accelerate lymphomagenesis, a cross-breeding study was undertaken with EmicroEBER1 and EmicroMyc mice. While no significant reduction in latency to lymphoma onset was observed in bi-transgenic mice, c-Myc induction was detected in some EmuEBER1 single transgenic tumours, indicative of a functional cooperation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study is the first to describe the in vivo expression of a polymerase III, non-coding viral gene and demonstrate its oncogenic potential. The data suggest that EBER1 plays an oncogenic role in EBV associated malignant disease.
