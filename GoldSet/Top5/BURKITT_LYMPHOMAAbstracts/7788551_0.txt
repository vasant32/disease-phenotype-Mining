c-myc gene amplification has been found in lung cancer, however, it can not explain all cases of lung cancer with c-myc gene overexpression. Gene translocation is one of the ways by which oncogene is activated. But the old methods for detecting gene mutations are not so effective for the detection of gene translocation, especially in solid tumors. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can be used to detect gene translocation more efficiently. Using FISH, we discovered c-myc gene translocation in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line GLC-82 and SV40T-transformed human bronchial epithelial cells. In GLC-82, c-myc gene translocated to the short arm of a C group marker chromosome. In the SV40T-transformed epithelial cells, c-myc gene translocated to 14q32, which was the same as that found in Burkitt's lymphomas. Translocation was related to oncogene activation. c-myc translocation may play an important role in the carcinogenesis of lung cancer.
