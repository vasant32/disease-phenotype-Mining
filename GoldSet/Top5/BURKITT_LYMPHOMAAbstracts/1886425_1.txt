A female patient with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (precursor B-ALL) was analyzed cytogenetically. Karyotyping of the leukemic cells showed a Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1), and also showed a translocation between 2p13 and 14q32, which is thought to be specific for children with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. DNA analysis with both conventional and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed the rearrangement of the c-abl gene, the BCR gene outside the 5.8 kb breakpoint cluster region (bcr or M-BCR), and the comigration of an abnormal Not I pHabl 5' and 3'-bcr fragment, indicating the presence of BCR/c-abl recombination. The JH gene was rearranged, but the JK gene showed a germline configuration, as with previously reported cases with a t(2;14). This case is the first report of a patient with Ph1-positive precursor B-ALL, in whom a specific translocation t(2;14)(p13;q32) is found simultaneously.
