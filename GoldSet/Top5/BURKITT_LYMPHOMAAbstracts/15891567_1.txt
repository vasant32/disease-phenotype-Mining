The authors describe the development of bladder paralysis in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia undergoing maintenance chemotherapy. Immediately before the adverse clinical event, the child had received vincristine intravenously and triple therapy with hydrocortisone, cytosine arabinoside, and methotrexate intrathecally and had begun a 5-day pulse of prednisolone. The authors conclude that the ensuing reversible bladder paralysis was related to the vincristine. The clinical event resolved, and vincristine was deleted from the child's subsequent therapy until full recovery was achieved. The authors advise recognition of this problem and discontinuation of the vincristine if transient bladder paralysis develops until symptoms completely disappear.
