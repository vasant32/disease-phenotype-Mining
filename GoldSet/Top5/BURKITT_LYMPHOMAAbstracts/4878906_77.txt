A comparison was made of the immunofluorescence tests for detection of cell membrane and Epstein-Barr virus antigens in cells from Burkitt tumor biopsies or continuous cultures derived therefrom. On the whole, cell membrane fluorescence in established lines appeared to depend not only upon the presence of EBV but to a considerable degree also upon the extent of the persistent viral infection. There was no constant relationship, however, between the results of the two tests and exceptions to the rule were noted. These observations indicate that different antigens are involved in the two tests. Biopsy cells in general and young cultures may reveal strong MIF activity but few, if any, EBV-positive cells. The reverse, the presence of relatively large numbers of EBV antigen-containing cells in the absence of significant MIF reactions, was also noted on occasion in a few established cultures. The possible interpretations of these findings have been discussed.
