The effect of neonatal thymus grafts implanted in nude mice previously transplanted with three different human malignant tumors - an adenocarcinoma of the colon, a malignant melanoma and a Burkitt's lymphoma - were studied. In all immunologically reconstituted animals tumord were rejected. Tumor rejection stated 2-3 weeks after thymus implantation, and was completed after 30-6 weeks. Histological examination of lymphoid tissues showed a correlation between immunological reconstitution and tumor rejection. The rejection process showed a characteristic histologic picture with 3 phases - an early, an intermediate and a late phase - these were similar in the three tumor types examined. The possible mechanisms of reconstitution and tumor rejection are discussed.
