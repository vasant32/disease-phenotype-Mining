Massive chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) have been successfully used for the treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma. We report our first success with such treatment in two children with Burkitt's lymphoma in Thailand. Both patients had massive abdominal tumors with ascites and minimal bone marrow metastasis at the first presentation. They received induction chemotherapy and intensive treatment including central nervous system prophylaxis with cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate until being in complete remission before starting massive chemotherapy, comprising the combination of BCNU, cytosine arabinoside, cyclophosphamide and 6-thioguanine followed by ABMT. Both patients recovered completely following intensive supportive treatments post ABMT and are still good health without evidence of the disease for 18 and 8 months after transplantation respectively. The role of massive chemotherapy and ABMT for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma especially Burkitt's lymphoma was discussed.
