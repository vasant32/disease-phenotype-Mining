After incubation at 37 C for 2 or more days, Basal Medium Eagle (BME) supplemented with 25% fetal calf serum (FCS) was not able to support adequate growth of EB3 and other lines of Burkitt tumor cells. The medium did, however, increase, by a factor of about 10, the number of cells synthesizing herpes-type virus with which the cultures were persistently infected. Not every lot of FCS produced these effects, nor were these effects seen when BME and FCS were incubated separately for 7 days before the medium was completed. At 37 C, appropriate lots of FCS interacted with several of the amino acids present in BME; this interaction resulted in an inhibition of cellular growth, whereas interaction with arginine yielded the virus-enhancing effect. Arginine-free BME, supplemented with 25% FCS and used without prior incubation, prevented cellular replication and promoted viral infection to a similar extent as did preincubated complete medium. Replenishment of arginine reduced, but did not regularly abolish, the virus-enhancing activity of preincubated media. RPMI-1629 medium was less affected by preincubation with FCS because it contained twice the amount of arginine that BME contained. The FCS factors which act upon arginine and other amino acids are not dialyzable and are partially resistant to heating at 56 or 60 C for 30 to 60 min. Calf and horse sera appear to be devoid of these activities. The nature of these interactions, as well as the mechanism by which arginine deficiency enhanced the viral infection, remains to be ascertained.
