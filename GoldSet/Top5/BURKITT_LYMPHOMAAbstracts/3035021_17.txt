We have analyzed cells of the B lineage for expression of the Tp44 antigen, a 44,000 homodimer detected by monoclonal antibody 9.3 on approximately 80% of mature human T lymphocytes. Previous evidence has suggested that Tp44 may function as a receptor for accessory signals in T cell activation. High level Tp44 expression was observed on plasmacytomas grown in cell culture and on plasma cells from bone marrow biopsies of multiple myeloma patients. This antigen is not present on resting B cells from either peripheral blood or lymphoid organs, or on any other B cell tumor. The growth kinetics and Ig production in plasmacytomas are not affected by the binding of antibody 9.3. Moreover, the Tp44 molecule is co-expressed with PCA-1, an antigen characteristic of plasma cells, on peripheral blood B cells stimulated in vitro to differentiate toward plasma cells. Tp44 may represent a later stage of B cell differentiation than PCA-1 because unlike the PCA-1 antigen, this molecule could not be detected on any EBV-transformed cell line or Burkitt's lymphoma lines. The m.w. of the Tp44 molecule expressed on plasma cells and on T cells is identical, as determined by immunoprecipitation of radioiodinated cell surface proteins with monoclonal antibody 9.3. This antigen might be useful in studying the mechanism of growth and differentiation of human B cells, the heterogeneity within plasma cell populations, and B cell interactions with other components of the immune system.
