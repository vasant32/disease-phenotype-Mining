The human thyroglobulin (Tg) gene is localized to chromosome 8 and regionally to band q24 as shown independently by both in situ hybridization techniques and Southern blot analysis of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids. Analysis of hybrids derived from a Burkitt lymphoma, with a translocation breakpoint in the oncogene c-myc, shows that the Tg gene is located distal from c-myc, towards the telomere of the long arm of chromosome 8. The finding of two high frequency restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in the 5' part of the Tg gene results in heterozygosity for at least one marker at chromosome 8, band q24, in 50% of a Caucasian population. These RFLPs cannot only be used for the study of inborn errors in Tg synthesis but also for linkage studies in the telomeric region of chromosome 8q.
