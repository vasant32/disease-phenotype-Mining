An in vitro model, called the Membrane Invasion Culture System (MICS), was used to study the invasive potential of an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL), an EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cell line of American origin and an EBV-positive BL of African origin. MICS measured the ability of these cell lines to invade reconstituted basement membrane-coated filters, which correlated with their tumorigenic and metastatic capabilities in a SCID mouse model. Furthermore, the significantly greater invasive behaviour of the EBV-positive LCL was directly correlated with the cells' ability to express and secrete human type IV collagenase (72 kDa), an important metalloproteinase responsible for the degradation of collagen IV in basement membranes. The data suggest that MICS and the SCID mouse are useful tests of tumorigenicity in lymphoid cells, with measurable effects in both systems related to human type IV collagenase activity. Both models allow further exploration of malignant phenotypes associated with EBV transformation of lymphoid tissues.
