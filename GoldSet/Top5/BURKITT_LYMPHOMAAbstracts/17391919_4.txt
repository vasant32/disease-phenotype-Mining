A retrospective review of cases histologically diagnosed as malignant lesions of the orofacial region in 1992-2003 from the records of the Department of Oral Pathology and Biology, Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria was carried out. All cases were subjected to analysis of age, gender, site distribution and histologic types. Malignant tumours constituted 18% of all the biopsies of orofacial lesions seen within the period. The mean age of patients was 42.2+/-21.5 years (range: 2.5-85). There were 177 (69%) epithelial tumours of which squamous cell carcinoma was predominant, 47 (18%) sarcomas and 32 (13%) lymphomas. Squamous cell carcinoma (44%) was the most common malignant orofacial tumour. Osteosarcoma (32%) and Burkitt's lymphoma (56%) was the predominant sarcoma and lymphoma, respectively. Patients with a histologic diagnosis of carcinoma were older than those with sarcomas and lymphomas (P<0.01), and those with a histologic diagnosis of malignant lymphoma were significantly younger than those with sarcomas (P<0.01). Almost 25% of patients with carcinomas were below the age of 40 years. Malignant orofacial tumours are not uncommon in the studied environment, with a sizable proportion of carcinomas occurring before the age of 40 years.
