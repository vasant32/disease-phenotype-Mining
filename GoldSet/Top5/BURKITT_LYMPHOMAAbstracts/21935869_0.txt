 OBJECTIVE: Angiogenesis is critical for the development of tumors. Although vascular endothelial growth factor is a well-known proangiogenic factor, its impact on B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not clear. The aim of this study is to evaluate vascular endothelial growth factor expression in subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Fifty-one patients with diagnoses of low and high grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were randomly selected and proper slides were immunostained with vascular endothelial growth factor antibody. The percentage of positive cells was recorded as the vascular endothelial growth factor score. A cut-off point was determined by using the median vascular endothelial growth factor score of all cases. The patients were subclassified as negative, weak or strong positive according to this cut-off point. RESULTS: The study cohort included 26 women and 25 men, aged 5 to 82 years. The number of low-grade patients diagnosed as grade I follicular lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma were 7 and 6; while the number of high grade patients diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt's lymphoma were 29 and 9, respectively. Twenty-five patients (49.0%) showed strong and 10 patients (19.6%) showed weak vascular endothelial growth factor immunoreactivity, while 16 patients (31.4%) showed no staining. No statistically significant difference was found for vascular endothelial growth factor expression between subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; as well as between low and high grade groups. CONCLUSION: Further studies in large and specific series are needed to determine the role of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor related pathways in the development and progression of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
