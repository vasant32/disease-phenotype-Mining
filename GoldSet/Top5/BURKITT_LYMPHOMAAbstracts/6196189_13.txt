Cytoplasmic RNA prepared from several human cell lines and tissues was hybridised to DNA from Epstein-Barr virus, human adenovirus types 2, 3 and 12 and human papovaviruses BK and JC. RNA from all the cells, regardless of whether or not they were virally infected, hybridised to specific regions of the Epstein-Barr virus or adenovirus genomes but not to papovavirus DNA. The cellular cross-hybridising species appear to be repetitive sequences which are conserved in higher eukaryotes. Mismatch estimations indicate a high degree of homology between the viral and host sequences. Detailed analysis of selected regions of viral DNA failed to reveal any primary-structural peculiarities.
