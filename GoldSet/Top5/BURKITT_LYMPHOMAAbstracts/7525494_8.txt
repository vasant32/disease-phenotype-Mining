Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is a very high-incidence malignancy in sub-Saharan Africa, where it targets mainly young children. This lymphoma is closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Diagnosis of BL relies on clinical presentation as well as histological results obtained from biopsies. In this report, 66 new patients from Malawi (one of the southernmost African countries with high-incidence BL), suspected on clinical grounds to present with BL, had fine needle aspiration biopsies taken, smeared on slides and used for May-Gr√ºnwald Giemsa staining. Duplicate slides were independently assessed for EBV presence and expression by DNA-DNA and/or RNA-RNA in situ hybridisation (ISH), using respectively the repetitive viral BamHIW DNA fragment in a biotinylated probe and the small EBV-encoded RNA EBER I in a digoxigenin-labelled riboprobe. There was very good correlation between the various techniques in the diagnosis of the lymphomas, showing 67% of clinically suspect cases to be BL. Our report, presenting data on BL in Malawi, illustrates the usefulness of a simple aspiration biopsy in the diagnosis of this malignancy by Giemsa staining and also in both types of ISH.
