Among 23 pediatric patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplant (OLT), we report two (11 and 26 months old) with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) that occurred in the early posttransplantation period. They were Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-negative and received graft from EBV-positive donors. The surveillance for EBV viremia using serial EBV polymerase chain reaction determinations in the peripheral blood was positive at 10 and 90 days after OLT concomitant with symptoms of primary infection, both patients were treated with gancyclovir. The patients should progression to a Burkitt's and a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that appeared 3 months posttransplantation. They were treated by withdrawal of immunosuppression and six courses of cyclophosphamide as well as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (Rituximab) every 21 days. One patient experienced acute graft rejection, which resolved with steroids and low doses of tacrolimus, she is free of disease at 24 months after the end of treatment. The other patient relapsed with a cerebral lymphoma, receiving aggressive chemotherapy, but died due to sepsis. In conclusion, PTLD occurred among in 2/23 patients who underwent OLT and appeared in the first quarter post OLT. The risk factors associated with early PTLD were primary EBV infection after OLT, young age, and EBV-negative recipient receiving a transplant from an EBV-positive donor. Antiviral treatment alone was inefficient; withdrawal of immunosuppression and courses of Rituximab and cyclophosphamide were well tolerated and controlled PTLD. The risk of graft rejection was increased by withdrawal of immunosuppression. One patient died.
