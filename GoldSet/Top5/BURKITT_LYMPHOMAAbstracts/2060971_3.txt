The role of cisplatin and FK-565 in up-regulation of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell induction by IL-2 was examined. Treatment of blood mononuclear cells (MNC) of healthy donors with cisplatin or FK-565 in the presence of IL-2 resulted in a significant increase in LAK activity against natural killer (NK)-resistant Daudi cells as assessed by the 4 h 51Cr release assay. Blood MNC treated with cisplatin alone was not cytotoxic to Daudi cells. However, MNC treated with FK-565 showed some cytotoxicity against Daudi cells. Addition of cisplatin to IL-2-stimulated MNC did not increase proliferation but did enhance cytotoxicity. FK-565 together with IL-2 increased both proliferation and cytotoxicity of blood MNC. These data suggest the potential of cisplatin and FK-565 in LAK adoptive immunotherapy for cancer treatment.
