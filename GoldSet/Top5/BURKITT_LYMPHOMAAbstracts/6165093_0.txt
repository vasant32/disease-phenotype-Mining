The Burkitt lymphoma (BL)-derived, HLA-DR antigen positive B cell line, EB1, is a consistently low stimulator in MLC. A rabbit antiserum raised against the strongly stimulating BL line DAUDI, after appropriate absorption with EB1, inhibits MLC stimulation by both B cell lines and allogeneic lymphocytes, whilst lectin-induced proliferation is not significantly affected. Indirect immunofluorescence and 125I-staphylococcal protein A binding to cells pre-incubated with this antiserum suggest that the antigen is present on both peripheral B and T cells, as well as on B lymphoblastoid and myeloma lines. We suggest that this antiserum is directed against lymphocyte activating determinant(s) (LADs) and that these are distinct from the serologically defined DR antigens.
