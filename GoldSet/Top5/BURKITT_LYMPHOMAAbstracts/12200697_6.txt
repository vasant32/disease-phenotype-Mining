Methotrexate (MTX) and cytarabine have been widely used for the treatment of acute leukemias and lymphomas for over 30 years. However, the optimal schedule of this combination is yet to be determined and a variety of schedules of the combination has been used. We studied the cytotoxic effects of MTX and cytarabine in combination against human leukemia cell lines at various schedules in vitro. The effects of the combinations at the concentration of drug that produced 80% cell growth inhibition (IC(80)) were analyzed using the isobologram method of Steel and Peckham. Simultaneous exposure to MTX and cytarabine for 3 days produced antagonistic effects in human T cell leukemia, MOLT-3 and CCRF-CEM, B cell leukemia, BALL-1, Burkitt's lymphoma, Daudi, promyelocytic leukemia, HL-60 and Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia, K-562 cells. Simultaneous exposure to MTX and cytarabine for 24 h produced antagonistic effects, sequential exposure to MTX for 24 h followed by cytarabine for 24 h produced synergistic effects, and the reverse sequence produced additive effects in both CCRF-CEM and HL-60 cells. Sequential exposure to MTX for 24 h followed by cytarabine for 3 days also produced synergistic effects in MOLT-3 cells. Cell cycle analysis supported these observations. Our findings suggest that the simultaneous administration of MTX and cytarabine is not appropriate and the sequential administration of MTX followed by cytarabine may be the optimal schedule of this combination.
