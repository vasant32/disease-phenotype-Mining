A mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) envelope glycoprotein 350, 72A1, inhibited EBV infection of B lymphocytes in vitro. When severe combined immunodeficient mice were injected with EBV-seronegative donors' peripheral-blood mononuclear cells and challenged with EBV, 72A1 MAb prevented development of EBV-positive tumors: none of the test mice (0/12) developed EBV-positive tumors. In contrast, 67% (8/12) of control mice developed EBV-positive tumors (P=.001). Purified 72A1 MAb was infused into 1 healthy adult and 4 EBV-seronegative children after liver transplant. No adverse reactions were seen in the adult or in 3 of the transplant recipients. The remaining patient developed a hypersensitivity reaction, thus underlining the need to humanize the MAb.
