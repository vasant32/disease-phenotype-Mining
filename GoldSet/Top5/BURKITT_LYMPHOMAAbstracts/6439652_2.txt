A Burkitt's lymphoma (BL)-specific antibody (anti-GP70), previously described, was used to analyse 22 different BL-cell lines. The results indicated specificity of antibodies to lines that contain both surface membrane Ig (SmIg) and cytoplasmic Ig (CyIg). BL-cell lines derived from more immature B cells that do not have SmIg but rather have only CyIg were negative. A comparative study with antibody to common ALL antigen (CALLA) and to another BL-specific antigen (BLA) revealed coexpression of GP70 with those two antigens, but no identity between them.
