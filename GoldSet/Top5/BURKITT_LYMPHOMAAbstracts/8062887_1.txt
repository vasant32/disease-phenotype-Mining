We attempted to identify the minimal residual leukemic clone as related to the clinical course in patients with acute B lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL). DNA was extracted from stored bone marrow slides, and the third complementarity determining region (CDRIII) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers with consensus sequences for VH and JH. After amplification of the CDRIII band, the DNA fragment of CDRIII was inserted into the cloning vector PUC118. After cloning, the DNA sequences for CDRIII were determined. Clonospecific DNA sequences in CDRIII were selected, and clonospecific primers for each patient were synthesized. Using the clonospecific primers, we carried out second-round PCR to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) during several stages of the clinical course. Basically, the sensitivity of detection for MRD was between 10(-4) and 10(-5) cells. Even when leukemic cells were not detected in the morphologic study, with this detection system, the MRD was identified as an amplified CDRIII band stained with ethidium bromide on agarose gel. After bone marrow transplantation (BMT), MRD was detected for at least 4 months. In this article, we discuss the difference in sensitivity of detection for MRD between the BCR-ABL fusion gene and CDRIII in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) B-ALL, as well as the possible clinical application of this method to predict relapse and prognosis.
