A Burkitt's-like B-cell lymphoma (BLL) has recently been shown to be associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which affects homosexual men. We report cytogenetic studies of two BLL tumors in homosexual men. Both tumors had chromosome translocations characteristic of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), one the t(8;14) and the other the t(8;22). The pathway of lymphomagenesis in this disorder is discussed in the light of recent data on chromosome change and localization of immunoglobulin genes and oncogenes.
