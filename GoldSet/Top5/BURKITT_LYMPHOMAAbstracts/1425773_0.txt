An improved method allowing incorporation of [3H]myo-inositol into the phosphoinositide pool of human lymphoid cells is described. The procedure devised involves cell permeabilization with a thiol-activated membranolytic toxin, alveolysin, and optimization of the phosphoinositide labeling and extraction. In these conditions 4 to 10% of the added [3H]myo-inositol is found intracellularly and half of this amount (2-5%) is incorporated into the phosphoinositide pool in only 1 h as compared to the classical 0.2 to 0.3% incorporation obtained after 10 to 20 h. The integrity of coupling between receptors and phospholipase C was assessed by the inositol phosphate production after cell stimulation by various agonists.
