ARK5, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related protein kinase mediating Akt signals, is closely involved in tumor progression, and its stage-associated expression was observed in colorectal cancer. In this study, we found ARK5 expression in multiple myeloma cell lines expressing c-MAF and MAFB. In addition, gene expression profiling of 351 clinical specimens revealed ARK5 expression in primary myelomas expressing c-MAF and MAFB, suggesting that ARK5 may be a transcriptional target of the Large-MAF family. Sequence analysis of the ARK5 gene promoter revealed that it contains two putative MAF-recognition element (MARE) sequences. In support of this hypothesis, ARK5 was induced when an MAFB or c-MAF expression vector was introduced into non-ARK5-expressing colon cancer cells. Furthermore, ARK5 promoter activity was dramatically decreased by mutation or deletion of MARE sequences. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed an interaction between the Large-MAF family proteins and MARE sequences in the ARK5 promoter. Moreover, in ARK5 mRNA-expressing multiple myeloma lines, but not in ARK5-negative lines, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 increased invasion activity. IGF-1-induced invasion was reproduced when ARK5 was overexpressed in Burkitt's lymphoma and plasmacytoma lines. Based on results, we conclude that ARK5 is a transcriptional target of the Large-MAF family through MARE sequence and that ARK5 may in part mediate the aggressive phenotype associated with c-MAF- and MAFB-expressing myelomas.
