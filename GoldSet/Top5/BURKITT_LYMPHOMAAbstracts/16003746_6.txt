Betulinic acid (BA), a pentacyclic triterpene of natural origin, effectively induces apoptosis in neuroectodermal tumors and was recently shown to be a potent trigger of cell death in human leukemia-derived cell lines. To explore the potential of BA in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, we tested a panel of 10 Burkitt's lymphoma (BL)-derived B-cell lines for sensitivity to BA. The human Jurkat T leukemia cell line was included as a positive control. Our studies show that BA exerts cytotoxic effects in some of the BL cell lines tested, including DG75, a chemoresistant BL cell line. However, cell death was caspase-independent, as evidenced by a lack of protection by zVAD-fmk, a pancaspase inhibitor, and displayed signs of necrosis. Furthermore, BA-induced caspase activation was seen to a minor extent in only 1 of the 10 BL cell lines tested (Ramos, a p53-deficient cell line), but was readily detected in Jurkat cells. Together, these studies indicate that resistance to BA-induced apoptosis is a common feature of BL-derived cell lines.
