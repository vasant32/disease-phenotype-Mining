The biological properties of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, Jijoye, were examined. the synthesis of virus capsid antigen (VCA) and early antigen (EA) in Jijoye cells was markedly enhanced by shift-down of the temperature of incubation from 37 degrees C to 33 degrees C. Cultures of Jijoye cells at 33 degrees C released a large amount of transforming EBV (10(5.2) of 50% transforming doses/ml) into the culture fluid. However, no infectious virus was produced in all cultures at 37 degrees C during the course of this study. The EBV (Jijoye EBV) from Jijoye line was found to possess only transforming activity, but not EA-inducing activity. Jijoye EBV lacks adsorbing capacity to Jijoye cells, in contrast to P3HR-I EBV which can adsorb to Jijoye cells. The Jijoye cells were highly susceptible to superinfection with P3HR-I EBV as demonstrated by the induction of EA, VCA and infectious EBV. The EBV induced by the P3HR-I EBV superinfection of Jijoye cells has also transforming activity but neither EA-inducing activity nor adsorbing capacity to Jijoye cells.
