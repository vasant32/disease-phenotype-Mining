 PURPOSE: To evaluate the ability of fluoroscopic images obtained during air enemas to depict or exclude lead points of intussusceptions and other abnormalities that require surgical treatment in the absence of intussusception. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical, radiologic, surgical, and pathologic findings were reviewed in 14 patients with lead points or other lesions. RESULTS: Fluoroscopic images failed to depict a lead point in 10 patients. The air enema easily reduced intussusceptions with benign lead points in seven patients. Fluoroscopic images depicted pathologic lead points in two patients and were normal in two patients with intussusception. Fluoroscopic images failed to depict an abnormality that required surgery in the absence of intussusception in two patients. CONCLUSION: Successful reduction of an intussusception does not always rule out a lead point. Other imaging studies, the patient's condition, and laparotomy may also be necessary to diagnose and treat lead points and other lesions.
