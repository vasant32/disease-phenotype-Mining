A new lymphoma cell line, designated SUBL, was established from a Japanese patient with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoma, which developed during FK 506 therapy after liver transplantation. This cell line has undergone 80 passages over a period of 22 months. The cultured cells were positive for CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, and HLA-DR, and negative for CD10 and surface immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulin gene analysis revealed rearrangements of JH and JK. T-cell antigens or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements were not observed on the cell line. The SUBL cells were positive for Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA). The EBV genome was detected in the original tissue and the cell line by the in situ hybridization method. These data indicate that this cell line represents the B-cell lineage at a pre-B-cell stage. SUBL cells showed successful heterotransplantation to mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Chromosomal analysis revealed the karyotype 46,XY,t(2;3)(p11;q27). Molecular studies showed that c-myc, N-myc, and bcl-2 were not rearranged. This cell line will provide a useful in vitro system to study the relationship between chromosomal abnormalities and the activation of cellular oncogenes.
