A human cell line established in culture from a histiocytic lymphoma patient synthesizes and secretes the monocyte-granulocyte specific enzyme lysozyme. 18 other human cell lines with characteristics of T-lymphocyte, B-lymphocyte, Burkitt's lymphoma, non-Burkitt's lymphoma, myeloma, and bone marrow epithelial cells were not associated with lysozyme. Among murine cell lines, lysozyme was produced by (a) three histiocytic lymphoma or macrophage lines, which mediate antibody-dependent phagocytosis and cytolysis; (b) myelomonocytic leukemia line which also secretes myeloid colony-stimulating factor; and (c) a spontaneous lymphoma and an Abelson leukemia virus-induced lymphoma. Lysozyme-negative lines include another Abelson lymphoma, myelomas, T lymphomas, and mastocytoma.
