The authors describe a child with Williams syndrome who developed Burkitt lymphoma with a t(8;14). Williams syndrome is a contiguous gene syndrome that is not associated with a predilection for cancer. However, the management of a child with Williams syndrome and a malignancy is complicated by underlying disease in multiple organs. In 2001, the American Academy of Pediatrics published health care guidelines for children with Williams syndrome. These guidelines were adopted in the treatment of this child. Disease-specific guidelines should be applied to other children with multisystem disorders such as Down syndrome that require treatment of a malignancy.
