A demographic and serological survey of Epstein-Barr virus infection was carried out in 5 geographically representative regions of Ethiopia. 80% of the 500 people studied were under 15 years of age. 82% of children under 5 years of age and 94% under 10 years of age were positive for IgG anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA) antibody. 51 of 100 children under 12 months of age and from 5 different provinces were positive for anti-VCA antibody. Of these, 23 were under 6 months. The distribution of anti-VCA antibody positivity was comparable in both sexes, in each age group and in the different provinces at different altitudes. Economic status, expressed in terms of estimated income, type of water supply, mode of excreta disposal and family size, did not significantly influence the distribution of anti-VCA antibody. Thus, early exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, with asymptomatic or subclinical presentation, probably accounts for the rarity of typical infectious mononucleosis in young adult Ethiopians. The lack of a relationship between Epstein-Barr virus infection and Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, malaria as well as liver diseases is briefly discussed.
