Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) carrying biopsies of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) were used to examine the question whether the EBV-associated nuclear antigen (EBNA) can be demonstrated by the acid fixed nuclear binding (AFNB) technique, developed previously for the demonstration of EBNA in cultured cell lines [11]. Extracts of 5 BL and 5 NPC biopsies gave a brilliant, EBNA specific fluorescence after binding to acid fixed chicken red cells. Similar extracts of 3 other African tumors that are not known to carry the EBV-genome were negative, in spite of the fact that they were derived from EBV-seropositive patients with relatively high anti-EBV (VCA) antibody titers. Crude extraction and DNA-cellulose purification gave equally active extracts, provided that incubation was carried out at 4 degrees C. These results show that the acid fixed nuclear binding technique can be applied to biopsy material. This may be helpful in searching for EBNA carrying cells in heterogeneous normal and tumor tissues in vivo where the direct in situ ACIF staining for EBNA is known to meet great difficulties.
