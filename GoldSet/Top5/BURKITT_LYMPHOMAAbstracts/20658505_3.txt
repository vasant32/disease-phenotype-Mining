The electrochemical and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection of cell lines of Burkitt's lymphoma (Ramos) by using magnetic beads as the separation tool and high-affinity DNA aptamers for signal recognition is reported. Au nanoparticles (NPs) bifunctionalized with aptamers and CdS NPs were used for electrochemical signal amplification. The anodic stripping voltammetry technology employed for the analysis of cadmium ions dissolved from CdS NPs on the aggregates provided a means to quantify the amount of the target cells. This electrochemical method could respond down to 67 cancer cells per mL with a linear calibration range from 1.0×10(2) to 1.0×10(5) cells mL(-1), which shows very high sensitivity. In addition, the assay was able to differentiate between target and control cells based on the aptamer used in the assay, indicating the wide applicability of the assay for diseased cell detection. ECL detection was also performed by functionalizing the signal DNA, which was complementary to the aptamer of the Ramos cells, with tris(2,2-bipyridyl) ruthenium. The ECL intensity of the signal DNA, replaced by the target cells from the ECL probes, directly reflected the quantity of the amount of the cells. With the use of the developed ECL probe, a limit of detection as low as 89 Ramos cells per mL could be achieved. The proposed methods based on electrochemical and ECL should have wide applications in the diagnosis of cancers due to their high sensitivity, simplicity, and low cost.
