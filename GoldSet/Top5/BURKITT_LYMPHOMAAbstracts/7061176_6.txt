Using a high-resolution chromosome banding technique, which provided more elongated and distinctly banded chromosomes, some new evidence was obtained for localization of break points in Burkitt lymphoma marker chromosomes. As a result, the characteristic translocation between chromosomes 8 and 14 was designated as t(8;14) (q24.1;q32.5) and the deletion of chromosome 15 was designated as del(15) (q13q15).
