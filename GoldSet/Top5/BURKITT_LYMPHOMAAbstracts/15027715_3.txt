The Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) is one of the viruses implicated in the pathogenesis of malignant tumors. Its association with Burkitt's Lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and certain cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma is well known. More recently this virus has been found to be associated with gastric carcinoma. Studies on this association, in our country are lacking. We have studied 37 cases of carcinoma using immunohistochemistry for LMP1 protein. Most workers have found an expression of latency type I antigens in gastric adenocarcinomas, with only a few cases being LMP1 positive. In the 37 cases studied by us, 24.14% of cases were positive for LMP1. LMP1 is known to have oncogenic properties. In addition, it has been demonstrated earlier that the EBV particles in gastric carcinoma are monoclonal. These two factors support a pathogenetic role for EBV in gastric carcinoma.
