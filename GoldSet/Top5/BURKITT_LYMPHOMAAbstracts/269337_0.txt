A confirmed case of American Burkitt's lymphoma with jaw involvement in a 12-year-old Caucasian girl from western Pennsylvania is described. There were clinical manifestations in the mandibular quadrants and radiographic manifestations in all mandibular and maxillary quadrants. One of the earliest clinical manifestations of the lymphoma in the mandible was observed by a family dentist. The lymphoma later produced a deterioration of the overlying mandibular mucosa, moderate expansion of the cortex of the mandible, and paresthesia of the lip with probable V3 involvement. Four months after the first admission there were radiographic manifestations of the lymphoma in both the maxillary and mandibular quadrants. Early diagnosis and appropriate management may improve the prognosis.
