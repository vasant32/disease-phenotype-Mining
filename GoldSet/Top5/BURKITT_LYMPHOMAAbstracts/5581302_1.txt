The clinical picture and local epidemiology in 65 cases of Burkitt's lymphoma seen in Ilesha, Western Nigeria, over a 16-year period is presented. Incidence figures have been calculated and comparison made with other Nigerian and East African reports. Ilesha is the centre of a high tumour density area. A changing pattern of presentation over the years has evolved. Its possible relationship to the treatment of malaria and immunization facilities is suggested and discussed.
