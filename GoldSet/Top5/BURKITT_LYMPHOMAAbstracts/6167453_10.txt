Human leukocytes interferon (HuIFN-A) increased the amount of beta2-microglobulin on the surface of human Burkitt lymphoma cells (Ramos) and also increased the amount released into the culture medium. The effect was observed 1 h after addition of IFN. These results suggest that the increase in beta2-microglobulin on the cell surface of IFN-treated cells is not due to a decreased shedding of antigen from the cell surface, nor an "unmasking" of surface antigen, but rather to an increased synthesis of antigen.
