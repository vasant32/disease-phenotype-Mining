A 33-year-old male was admitted because of severe neutropenia (55/microliter) in 1985. A diagnosis of autoimmune neutropenia was not made. CD4+ T-lymphocyte count was 128/microliter and CD4/CD8, 0.1, though the titers of immunoglobulins were in normal range. Nine times examinations of CD4+ T-lymphocyte count resulted in 5 times lower counts than 300/microliter between 1985 and 1993. His HIV (type 1 and type 2) studies were negative. He suffered from EB virus infection in 1987. The titers of VCA-IgG and EA-IgG had been elevated for half a year after that. He was operated polyp-like tumors in bilateral nasal cavities on February in 1994. The diagnosis was Burkitt's lymphoma that was also demonstrated by in situ hybridization using EB virus RNA. He was treated with a modification of COPBLAM III, but he died on June in 1994. Autopsy revealed tumor cell infiltrations in multiple organs. We suspect that he developed Burkitt's lymphoma 82 months later, when he had complicated EB virus infection in condition of idiopathic CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia caused by unknown origin.
