We have used the 7AAD/PY method to analyze the cell cycle status of normal human bone marrow hematopoiesis, and found that the cell kinetics differed. There were cells with relatively low levels of RNA in the S-phase (Type I) and a high level in the S-phase (Type 11). T-cells, B-cells, nucleated red cells and CD34+/CD19+ early B-cells in bone marrow were Type I, whereas myelomonocytic subset and CD34+/CD33-dim+ common myeloid cells were Type II. AC133+/CD38-dim cells, which were thought to be lineage-marker negative hematopoietic stem cells, had intermediate amounts of RNA in the S-phase between Type I and II (Type 0). Seventy-four cases of acute leukemia were also analyzed. Most of the T- and B-ALL cases were found to be Type I, most of the ANLL cases were Type II, and there were 10 cases that were Type 0. These findings yielded fundamental information about normal hematopoiesis and acute leukemia.
