 STUDY DESIGN: Case report. OBJECTIVE: The authors present a case of atypical Burkitt's lymphoma with multiple epidural involvements. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spinal cord compression in children is an emergency that requires urgent attention to minimize neurologic dysfunction. Although it is not life-threatening in most patients, cord compression can cause severe neurologic morbidity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Because the patient showed rapid neurologic deterioration, we started chemotherapy and high-dose steroids without laminectomy or radiotherapy immediately after a tumor biopsy from the left mandible. RESULT: The combined therapies were very effective and his neurologic symptoms improved immediately. The epidural involved masses disappeared in imaging studies after the first course of chemotherapy including methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg per day for 3 consecutive days and gradually tapered off over 2 weeks), vincristine (1.5 mg/m2 per day), cyclophosphamide (2 g/m2 per day for 2 days) and pirarubicin (40 mg/m2 per day). After completing seven courses of chemotherapy, the patient is now fully ambulant. CONCLUSION: Considering the severe late effects of laminectomy and radiotherapy, chemotherapy should be considered as a first choice of treatment for spinal cord compression caused by malignant lymphoma.
