LL2 is a murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) that has been shown to be effective for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma. Studies have also shown that radiolabeled murine LL2 (mLL2) or mLL2 and fragments thereof coupled to Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) can effectively target human B cell lymphoma in mice. We have obtained the DNA sequences encoding the VK and VH domains of mLL2, an IgG2a MAb, which were combined with their respective human kappa and IgG1 constant region domains and expressed in SP2/0 cells. Like its murine counterpart, the chimeric LL2 (cLL2) antibody is glycosylated in the light chain variable region. Chimerization did not interfere with the immunoreactivity of the antibody, as determined by a competitive binding assay, where either antibody shows equivalent inhibition of the binding of its counterpart to the Raji cell membrane surface antigen, CD22. Both antibodies bind and are rapidly internalized by Raji cells, whereas an irrelevant humanized antibody did not bind and was not internalized under similar conditions. The internalization rates of the bound murine or chimeric antibodies were nearly identical, with Ke values of 0.106 and 0.118 min-1 for mLL2 and cLL2, respectively. The observed close equivalence between the murine and chimeric antibodies suggests potential advantages of the latter as a less immunogenic agent. Studies are currently underway to evaluate the chimeric antibody as a potential therapeutic immunoconjugate.
