A case of disseminated Burkitt's lymphoma with nervous system involvement in a HIV negative 35 year old lady is described. She primarily presented with multiple cranial nerve palsies. At autopsy, diffuse involvement of parenchymatous organs and lymphomatous meningitis with conspicuous sparing of gastrointestinal system was observed. In addition, there was an unusual feature of paraneoplastic demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. Incidentally, a large hydatid cyst was also seen in the left lobe in addition to the lymphomatous involvement of the liver.
