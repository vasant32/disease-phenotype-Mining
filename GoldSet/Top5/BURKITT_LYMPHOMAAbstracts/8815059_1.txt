To determine the place of surgery in the management of abdominal Burkitt's lymphoma, we retrospectively reviewed the records of 17 children treated over a period of 10 years (1983-1992). Patients were 14 males. Seven patients presented with acute abdominal pain, 6 with an abdominal mass and 5 with intestinal obstruction. In 3 cases, the diagnosis was made without laparotomy (2 percutaneous tumoral puncture, 1 pleural puncture). In the 14 other cases, the diagnosis was made by laparotomy with 3 biopsies and 11 resection of the tumor (7 complete and 4 incomplete). These laparotomies were complicated by 1 evisceration and 2 intestinal obstruction. At the end of the initial chemotherapy, 1 children was reoperated for a residual mass with no histological viable tumor. Sixteen children were long term survivors (14 > 2 years); 1 died. Surgery was indicated in cases of intestinal intussusception. In cases of abdominal mass, surgery could have been avoided twice (positive ascitic fluid). A complete tumoral resection had no influence on survival which depend of extra-abdominal extension and more over of response to chemotherapy.
