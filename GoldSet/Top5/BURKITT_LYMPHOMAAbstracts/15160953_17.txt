Burkitt and Burkitt-like lymphomas are rapidly growing tumors which require specialized therapy. Although intensive, multi-agent regimens have been effective in children, results are more variable in adults. Magrath et al. previously described a regimen that was highly effective in children and young adults. This phase II study of a modified Magrath regimen was designed to assess its efficacy in older adults and reduce treatment-related toxicity. Fourteen patients with Burkitt/Burkitt-like lymphoma and median age of 47 years were stratified into two categories: low-risk (normal LDH and a single focus of disease measuring less than 10 cm, 3 patients) and high risk (all other, 11 patients). Low-risk patients received three cycles of modified CODOX-M (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, adriamycin, vincristine with intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine followed by high-dose systemic methotrexate, regimen A). High-risk patients received four alternating cycles of regimens A and B (A-B-A-B). Regimen B consisted of ifosfamide, cytarabine, etoposide and intrathecal methotrexate (IVAC). The modified treatment regimen was associated with no grade 3/4 neuropathy and only one episode of grade 3/4 mucositis. All patients completed protocol therapy and there were no treatment-related deaths. Twelve patients (86%, 90% CI: 61 97%) achieved a complete response; 1 patient achieved a PR and 1 patient died of progressive disease. Nine patients (64%) are alive and disease free at a median follow-up of 29 months. This modified Magrath regimen is effective and well-tolerated in a representative group of older adult patients.
