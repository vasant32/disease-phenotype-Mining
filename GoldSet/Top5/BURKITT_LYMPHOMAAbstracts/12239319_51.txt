To elucidate the mechanisms by which Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency III gene expression transforms primary B lymphocytes to lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), the associated alterations in cell gene expression were assessed by using 4,146 cellular cDNAs arrayed on nitrocellulose filters and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). A total of 1,405 of the 4,146 cDNAs were detected using cDNA probes from poly(A)(+) RNA of IB4 LCLs, a non-EBV-infected Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell line, BL41, or EBV latency III-converted BL41 cells (BL41EBV). Thirty-eight RNAs were consistently twofold more abundant in the IB4 LCL and BL41EBV than in BL41 by microarray analysis. Ten of these are known to be EBV induced. A total of 23 of 28 newly identified EBV-induced genes were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. In addition, nine newly identified genes and CD10 were EBV repressed. These EBV-regulated genes encode proteins involved in signal transduction, transcription, protein biosynthesis and degradation, and cell motility, shape, or adhesion. Seven of seven newly identified EBV-induced RNAs were more abundant in newly established LCLs than in resting B lymphocytes. Surveys of eight promoters of newly identified genes implicate NF-kappaB or PU.1 as potentially important mediators of EBV-induced effects through LMP1 or EBNA2, respectively. Thus, examination of the transcriptional effects of EBV infection can elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which EBV latency III alters B lymphocytes.
