Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the skull base presenting with neuro-ophthalmologic abnormalities or cavernous sinus involvement is very rare in children. We have found only 13 reported cases of cavernous sinus involvement by lymphoma [1]. We report the case of the youngest child diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma of the cavernous sinus and sphenoid sinus, whose first presentation was cavernous sinus syndrome with neuro-ophthalmologic findings.
