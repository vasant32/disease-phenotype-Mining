We report the case of a male adolescent affected by Burkitt Lymphoma which presented as acute abdominal pain and rapid growth mass. It was characterized by computed tomography and diagnose was confirmed by bone marrow study. Two different chemotherapic regimens were used because of unfavourable evolution, but they were not successful. We consider some other causes of abdominal bulky in childhood, especially primary tumours and non tumoural diseases.
