The ebv dna integrated into the host genome from cell of an African Burkitt lymphoma biopsy has been compared to the corresponding fraction of EBV DNA from the cell line SU-AmB-2 which is of American Burkitt lymphoma origin. It is shown that while, in the case of the African biopsy, large pieces of EBV DNA sequences are integrated into the host DNA, much smaller pieces of virus DNA are integrated into the DNA of the SU-AmB-2 cells. The possibility that this difference might be related to the fact that EBV is rarely associated with Burkitt lymphomas outside East Africa is discussed.
