Two patients who underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation for recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma relapsed at 46 and 28 days after the transplant. Both patients had an HLA-identical sibling and were treated with high-dose chemotherapy and allogeneic marrow transplantation. One patient is now 24 months after the allogeneic transplant without evidence of disease. The second patient died on day 7 with interstitial pneumonia. We conclude that high-dose therapy and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation after failure of autologous transplantation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is feasible and should be considered in young patients with HLA-identical siblings.
