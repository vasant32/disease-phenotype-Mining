 OBJECTIVE: The "Chinese Fan Spread" (CFS) distraction technique for laparoscopic reduction of intussusception is herein described and its outcome and benefits are evaluated. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent attempts at laparoscopic reduction of intussusception at our center. The CFS distraction technique was consistently applied in all cases. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were identified. Median age was 2.4 years (range, 4 months to 10.3 years). Indications for surgery included (1) failed pneumatic reduction (n=11), (2) need to evaluate for lead point in a patient with 4 recurrences (n=1), (3) need to biopsy the lead point in a patient with suspected lymphoma (n=1), and (4) diagnostic laparoscopy for evaluation of hematochezia (n=1). Two patients who failed laparoscopic reduction by the CFS distraction technique also failed open manual reduction, requiring right hemicolectomy. Of the 12 (86%) who were successfully reduced laparoscopically, pathologic lead points were identified in 5 (2 acute appendicitis, 1 Meckel's diverticulum, 1 harmatomatous polyp, and 1 Burkitt's lymphoma). Lead points were excised laparoscopically or via a vertical transumbilical incision. There were no complications. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic reduction of intussusception by the CFS distraction technique is effective and safe. Lead points may be dealt with together either laparoscopically or via a transumbilical incision.
