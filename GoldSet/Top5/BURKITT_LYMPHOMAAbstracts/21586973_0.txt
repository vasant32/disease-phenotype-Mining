Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) are a heterogenic group of lymphoproliferative diseases with their different behavior pattern and response to treatments. As a Hodgkin disease, NHL occurs from lymphoid tissues and can spread to other organs. Prognosis depends on histologic type, grade, and treatment. In the World Health Organization classification, aggressive B-cell lymphomas are diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, and precursor lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. They may present either nodal or extranodal disease, which may be either localized or disseminated. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of lymphoma in adults and is clinically, morphologically, and genetically a heterogeneous group of malignant proliferations of mature B cells, too. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of NHL and accounts for about 30% of the cases. In this clinical report, we evaluated clinically and histopathologically a 64-year-old male patient who had mild pain and edema in his mandibular premolar region, and the excisional biopsy showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
