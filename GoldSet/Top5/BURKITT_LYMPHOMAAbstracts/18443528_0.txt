AIM: Lymphomas of the gastrointestinal tract are the most common type of primary extranodal lymphomas, accounting for 5 to 10% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1996 to November 2005, 10 patients with primary intestinal lymphomas were submitted with clinical signs of acute abdomen to the Pediatric surgical department in Sofia. The children presented with radiologically proven intussusception, ileal obstruction or peritonitis due to bowel perforation. RESULTS: At exploration the tumor was located in the ileum in 4 cases, in the terminal ileum and coecum in 3 cases, appendix in one and multiple sites were found in 2 cases. Children with localized disease underwent radical resection of the tumor mass with ileo - transverso anastomosis (3), partial bowel resection (4), and appendectomy (1) whereas in 2 children with advanced disease diagnostic biopsy alone with temporary ileostomy in one were accomplished. According to histology, 5 patients had Burkitt lymphoma and 5 lymphoblast NHL. The children were treated according CHOP. Over five - years relapse - free survival for localized disease accounts 6 children. CONCLUSION: Primary NHL in children often presents with acute abdominal condition requiring surgical exploration. Prognosis depends of adequacy of surgical resection and the adjuvant chemotherapy.
