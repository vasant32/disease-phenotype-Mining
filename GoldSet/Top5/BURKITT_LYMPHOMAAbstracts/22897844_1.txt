Chromosomal translocations causing deregulated c-MYC expression are detectable in most Burkitt lymphoma cases. However, little is known about the additional lesions necessary for lymphomagenesis. Now, two independent studies, one of which was performed by Sander etÂ al. in this issue of Cancer Cell, identify constitutive PI3K signaling and CyclinD3 mutations as cooperating lesions in both mice and humans. The results have directly actionable therapeutic implications.
