Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA (EBER) is nonpolyadenylated, noncoding RNA, forms stem-loop structure by intermolecular base-pairing giving rise to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-like molecule and exists abundantly in EBV-infected cells. EBER induces IL-10 and thus supports the growth of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells. In this study, the mechanism of IL-10 induction by EBER was analysed in the context of dsRNA signaling pathway. Knockdown of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) by small interfering RNA (siRNA), and expression of dominant-negative RIG-I downregulated IL-10 induction in EBER(+) EBV-infected and EBER plasmid-transfected BL cells. Transfection of EBER-expressing plasmid or in vitro synthesized EBER induced IL-10 in RIG-I-expressing cell clones, and activation of IL-10 promoter by EBER was blocked by dominant-negative RIG-I. Blocking of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB by dominant-negative IkappaB-alpha plasmid did not block IL-10 expression, whereas knockdown of IRF-3 by siRNA resulted in downregulation of IL-10 in EBER(+) BL cells. NF-kappaB is reported to function downstream of RIG-I signaling pathway and is involved in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Our results indicate that EBER induces an anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 through RIG-I-mediated IRF-3 but not NF-kappaB signaling. These findings suggest a new mechanism of dsRNA signaling pathway that triggers the expression of IL-10, which acts as an autocrine growth factor in BL cells.
