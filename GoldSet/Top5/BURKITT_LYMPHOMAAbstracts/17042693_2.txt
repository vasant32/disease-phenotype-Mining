A 53-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of tracheal compressive symptoms from a rapidly expanding thyroid mass. The patient first noticed the nodule less than a week prior to admission. Thyroid tests were normal. A fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy showed a monotonous population of intermediate-sized lymphoid cells with scant cytoplasm suspicious for lymphoma. Twelve hours later an emergent computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed left tracheal deviation with compression, however, there were no signs of tumor invasion. The patient received emergent CHOP (clophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, prednisone) and rituxan therapy. His mass completely resolved within 36 hours. Bone marrow biopsy provided the final diagnosis of stage IV Burkitt's lymphoma and his therapy was changed to hyper CVAD-R chemotherapy (cytoxan, vincristine, adriamycin, dexamethasone, rituxan). The patient's hospital course was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome that was managed by hydration and allopurinol. To our knowledge, this is only the second reported case of Burkitt's lymphoma presenting as a thyroid mass. His presentation highlights the urgency in diagnosis and provides an opportunity to review a rare type of primary thyroid lymphoma.
