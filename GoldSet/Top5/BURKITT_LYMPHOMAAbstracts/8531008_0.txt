It is technically challenging for the detection of target DNA in low abundancy, such as viral DNA sequences in latently infected cells by nonisotopic in situ hybridization (ISH). Consistent result is even more difficult to achieve on routine paraffin sections. Proteolytic enzyme digestion is most critical for both consistency and sensitivity of the technique. We here have investigated the effect of enzyme digestion on cell morphology, protein and DNA reduction, and hybridization efficiency. The results demonstrated that enzyme digestion improves efficiency of ISH through a process involving partial DNA purification on sections. There is a clear relationship between proteolytic enzyme digestion, morphology changes, and hybridization efficiency. Although detection of DNA sequences in abundance can be achieved within a relatively wide range of digestion levels, maximum hybridization efficiency was always related to the cells, which showed morphology of nuclear swollen, weak homogeneous chromatin staining with hematoxylin and loss of visible nuclear membrane. Detection of viral DNA in low copy number critically depends on the creation of the morphologic changes by enzyme digestion. The morphological changes would therefore serve as important criteria for optimal digestion, result interpretation, and comparison.
