The article sets forth clinico-anatomical characteristics of Burkkit's lymphoma (50 observations). The investigation was carried out in the granted hospital in Kenya, were the authors had worked from 1967 to 1971. A histological feature of the tumour was a peculiar picture of the "starry sky", which was associated with the presence of large histiocytesmacrophages among prolypherating lymphoid cells, a cytological feature being the availability of vacuoles in the nucleus and cytoplasma. In the majority of cases Burkkit's tumour had multicentrical growth, most often localizations were jaws and ovaries. The authors observed in some cases considerable therapeutic effect of chemical preparations.
