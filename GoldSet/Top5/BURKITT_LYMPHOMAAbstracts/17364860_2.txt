Exposure to aldehydes represents potential risks to human and animal health. Cyclic aldehydes such as benzaldehyde, 2-furaldehyde, and paraldehyde were found to induce formation of stable DNA-protein cross-links (DPXs) in cultured human lymphoma cells. A relationship between increased cytotoxicity and DPX formation was observed with each aldehyde. Paraldehyde is a sedative drug used predominately in treatment of ethanol withdrawal. Paraldehyde was the most potent cross-linking aldehyde studied, yet least cytotoxic. Although DPX formation by aliphatic aldehydes is well-known, this study confirms the potential for cyclic aldehydes to cause formation of DPXs in cultured cells at therapeutically relevant doses.
