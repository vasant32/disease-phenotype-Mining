The Epstein-Barr virus genome carried in the Burkitt lymphoma nonproducer cell line Raji was characterized by partial denaturation mapping and by hybridization of cloned viral fragments to filters containing separated Raji DNA fragments. Partial denaturation mapping revealed that the EBV DNA population of Raji cells is homogeneous and that two deletions are observed in distant parts of the genome compared to linear DNA isolated from virus particles of different strains. These deletions were characterized by blot analysis. One deletion of 3.15 kb lies within HindIII-E; the second is 2.4 kb and is located close to the right terminus of linear viral DNA. The two deletions were observed in several cell lines derived from the Raji line. These deletions might contribute to the inability of Raji cells to produce EBV either spontaneously or upon induction.
