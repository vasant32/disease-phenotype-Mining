The chimeric anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (Rituxan, IDEC-C2B8) is widely used in the clinical treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Rituximab sensitizes NHL B-cell lines to drug-induced apoptosis via down-regulation of Bcl-x(L) expression. We hypothesized that the mechanism by which rituximab down-regulates Bcl-x(L) may be, in part, due to inhibition of constitutive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity that regulates Bcl-x(L) expression. This hypothesis was tested in CD20(+) drug-resistant Ramos (Bcl-2(-)/Bcl-x(L)(+)) and Daudi (Bcl-2(+)/Bcl-x(L)(+)) cell lines. Rituximab decreased the phosphorylation of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase, IkappaB kinase, and IkappaB-alpha, diminished IKK kinase activity, and decreased NF-kappaB DNA binding activity. These events occurred with similar kinetics and were observed 3 to 6 hours post-rituximab treatment. Rituximab significantly up-regulated Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein expression, thus interrupting the NF-kappaB signaling pathway concomitant with Bcl-x(L) and Bfl-1/A1 down-regulation. The role of NF-kappaB in the regulation of Bcl-x(L) transcription was shown using promoter reporter assays in which deletion of the two-tandem NF-kappaB binding sites in the upstream promoter region significantly reduced the luciferase activity. This was further corroborated by using IkappaB superrepressor cells and by NF-kappaB-specific inhibitors. The direct role of Bcl-x(L) in drug resistance was assessed by using Bcl-x(L)-overexpressing cells, which exhibited higher drug resistance that was partially reversed by rituximab. Rituximab-mediated inhibition of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and chemosensitization was corroborated by the use of specific inhibitors. These findings reveal a novel pathway mediated by rituximab through Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein induction that negatively regulates the constitutive NF-kappaB pathway and chemosensitization of the NHL B-cells.
