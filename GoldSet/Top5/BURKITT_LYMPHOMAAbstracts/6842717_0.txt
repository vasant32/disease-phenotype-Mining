There have been many reports of space-time clusters of patients with Hodgkin's disease, childhood leukemia and Burkitt's lymphoma. We present a tight space cluster of 4 men with pathologically confirmed testicular seminomas. None of the men had any known reason to be at increased risk for testicular cancer. They all lived in the same immediate neighborhood for at least 7 years. There were 2 sources of potential carcinogens in the area. It is concluded that testicular cancer may have developed in these men as a result of exposure to environmental carcinogens.
