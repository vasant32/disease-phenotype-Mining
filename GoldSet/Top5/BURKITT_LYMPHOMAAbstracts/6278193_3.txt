The effect of the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) on the C3 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) receptors in various human lymphoblastoid cells was investigated with the use of the erythrocyte-antibody-complement (EAC) rosette formation method and a quantitative bioassay for EBV receptors. TPA caused a significant decrease of C3 receptors in the cultures of both Raji and SB4 cells (by approximately 50% of the C3 receptors in untreated cultures at 10 ng/ml). Kinetic studies revealed that the rate of reduction was rather moderate but progressive, reaching a maximum 5 days after treatment with TPA. Kinetic studies showed that EBV receptors also decreased, similar to the reduction seen with C3 receptors after TPA treatment. The effect of TPA on the reduction of C3 receptors was observed not only in these cells but also in other EBV-positive B-cells, subclones of SB4 cells, and MOLT-4 cells. However, in an EBV-negative B-cell line, BJAB, EAC rosette formation was significantly enhanced.
