We have studied the effects of retinoic acid (RA) on bone marrow leukemic cells from children with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) at the time of diagnosis, and on cells from four ALL/lymphoma cell lines (common-ALL, pre-B-ALL, T-ALL, and Burkitt's lymphoma) derived from children with these diseases. Cells were cultured in methylcellulose medium with clinically attainable concentrations (0.25-2.0 microM) of RA for two weeks prior to colony and cluster quantitation. Myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM) obtained from children with hematologically normal bone marrows were also cultured with RA. Of 19 patients with ANLL whose cells formed colonies, 16 (84%) were inhibited by RA; three patients showed either increased or unchanged colony numbers with RA. RA had a similar effect on both ANLL cluster and colony growth. RA (1-2 microM) also inhibited colony growth of the pre-B-ALL, common-ALL, and Burkitt's lymphoma lines; the T-ALL line and normal bone marrow CFU-GM were not inhibited. The inhibitory effects of RA on pediatric ANLL bone marrow cells and on some ALL/lymphoma cell lines compared with CFU-GM indicate that RA may be of value in the treatment of these malignancies in children.
