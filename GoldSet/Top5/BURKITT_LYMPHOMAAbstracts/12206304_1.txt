In order to understand mechanistic relationships between signaling pathways regulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation, we compared MAPK phosphorylation, and EBV reactivation and latency in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (BLCLs) versus B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). EBV was reactivated in the BLCLs Akata and Raji, and in a LCL OB-R33 cells after cross-linking surface immunoglobulin (sIg) with anti-Ig. After stimulation with anti-Ig, MAPK phosphorylation was strongly induced in all BLCLs and in a few LCLs, but not in other LCLs. MAPK was constitutively phosphorylated in most LCLs but not in BLCLs. Expression of EBNA2 and LMP1, and LMP2A was analyzed with both immunoblotting and RT-PCR. EBNA2 and LMP1 were expressed in most LCLs and in some BLCLs. LMP2A was expressed in all BLCLs and LCLs except Namalwa cells. To test the hypothesis that LMPI induces constitutive MAPK phosphorylation, the LMP1 expression vector was transfected into Akata cells. MAPK phosphorylation was not induced in such transfected cells. Our results indicate that BLCLs and LCLs respectively have distinct MAPK phosphorylation patterns, and that induction of MAPK phosphorylation correlates with EBV reactivation in a few cell lines but not in most of the tested cell lines.
