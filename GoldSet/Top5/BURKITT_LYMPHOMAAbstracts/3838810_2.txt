Magnetic resonance imaging has been used to evaluate 10 children with lymphomas and was able to identify disease in all 10 cases and monitor response to therapy in all three patients with follow-up studies. It could not distinguish between the different histological types of lymphoma. The image intensity of a diseased spleen in one case was different from that of five other normal spleens in six children with Hodgkins disease. Magnetic resonance imaging compared well with computed tomography and it was especially good at identifying blood vessels.
