CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (CEBP) transcription factors play pivotal roles in proliferation and differentiation, including suppression of myeloid leukemogenesis. Mutations of CEBPA are found in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in some cases of familial AML. Here, using cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and molecular cloning, we show that 5 CEBP gene family members are targeted by recurrent IGH chromosomal translocations in BCP-ALL. Ten patients with t(8;14)(q11;q32) involved CEBPD on chromosome 8, and 9 patients with t(14;19)(q32;q13) involved CEBPA, while a further patient involved CEBPG, located 71 kb telomeric of CEBPA in chromosome band 19q13; 4 patients with inv(14)(q11q32)/t(14;14)(q11;q32) involved CEBPE and 3 patients with t(14;20)(q32;q13) involved CEBPB. In 16 patients the translocation breakpoints were cloned using long-distance inverse-polymerase chain reaction (LDI-PCR). With the exception of CEBPD breakpoints, which were scattered within a 43-kb region centromeric of CEBPD, translocation breakpoints were clustered immediately 5' or 3' of the involved CEBP gene. Except in 1 patient with t(14;14)(q11;q32), the involved CEBP genes retained germ-line sequences. Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR showed overexpression of the translocated CEBP gene. Our findings implicate the CEBP gene family as novel oncogenes in BCP-ALL, and suggest opposing functions of CEBP dysregulation in myeloid and lymphoid leukemogenesis.
