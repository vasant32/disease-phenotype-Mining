Burkitt's lymphoma is the most common malignancy in African children but can occur sporadically in every country. It is one of the most aggressive malignancies in the human body, and in the past the prognosis was very poor. However, complex chemotherapy regimens can now cure approximately 50-80% of adult patients with Burkitt's lymphoma or small noncleaved lymphoma, and in pediatric populations the cure rate is even higher. Although the African type has a preference to the head and neck region (whereas the sporadic type to the abdomen), involvement of the base of the tongue is extremely rare as only 1 case has ever been reported in the English literature. The present study describes a patient with Burkitt's lymphoma presenting as a single mass in the base of the tongue without any abdominal or other extra-abdominal involvement. The patient was submitted to chemotherapy (intravenous and intrathecal) and skull radiotherapy. Today, 17 months after the diagnosis, the patient is disease free. Physicians should be aware of the extranodal manifestations of Burkitt's lymphoma and their differential diagnosis in order to achieve early diagnosis and treatment.
