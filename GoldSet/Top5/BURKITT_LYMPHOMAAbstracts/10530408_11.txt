Ig heavy chain (IgH) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of diagnostic tumour samples from 91 patients (57 children and 34 adults, with cut-off at age 16) with precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Using primers directed to the framework regions (FR) 1, 2 and 3 of the IgH gene, clonal IgH rearrangements were observed in 82, 58 and 58%, respectively, whereas clonality was presented in 45 and 27% using primers hybridising to the TCR delta and gamma genes. A combination of all five primer sets used resulted in 96% positive cases (children 100%, adults 88%). The frequency of clonal IgH rearrangements correlated to patient age with a significantly lower fraction of positive cases in the adult group. The concomitant usage of more than one V(H) family gene was similar for childhood and adult ALL, and an over-representation of V(H)6 rearrangements was found in childhood ALL. Twenty-five out of 91 cases (27%) displayed an oligoclonal pattern for either IgH or TCR gene rearrangements (children 37%, adults 12%). A comparative analysis of samples from different compartments was performed in 23 patients, and differences between two or three compartments were observed in seven cases. Unexpectedly large, clonally appearing PCR products of 540-715 bp were found in three leukemias and sequence analysis verified their clonal nature. In summary, using multiple sets of primers clonal rearrangements of IgH and TCR genes can be detected in a very high frequency, including previously neglected large size PCR products. A common heterogeneity was demonstrated in different compartments reflecting ongoing clonal evolution, which can make detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in ALL troublesome. Therefore, we suggest that a minimum of three targets should be used to minimise false-negative results.
