Characteristic patterns of cell bound lysosomal glycosidases were found in different lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes. The enzyme pattern resembled that found in normal lymphocytes from healthy individuals except for a marked increase in alpha-L-fucosidase. beta-D-Glucuronidase on the contrary markedly decreased in the lymphoblastoid cells. Burkitt's lymphoma cells on the other hand showed glycosidase patterns that were quite distinct from those in lymphoblastoid cells. Each lymphoma cell line showed a characteristic pattern. This is one indication of a heterogeneous origin of these tumors. Glycosidase patterns may be used to roughly distinguish different lymphoid cell lines.
