Lectins, known to recognize endothelial cell adhesion molecules, have been shown to release endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) from blood vessels. We investigated the effects of different leukocyte-type cells to determine if these cells, by interacting with the endothelium, could release EDRF from the circumflex branch of the canine coronary artery. The following cells were investigated: human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60), human monocyte (THP-1), and human Burkitt lymphoma (DAUDI). All of these cells produced a significant endothelium-dependent relaxation of the dog coronary artery in the presence of ibuprofen. The endothelium-dependent relaxations were reversed by hemoglobin (10 microM), methylene blue (3 microM), 6-anilino-5,8-quinolinedione (LY 83583, 30 microM), and NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 1 mM). HL-60 cells grown in the presence of 1 mM L-NAME retained their ability to cause endothelium-dependent relaxation of the canine coronary artery, suggesting that the source of the NO was the endothelium and not the HL-60 cells. The cell-induced vascular relaxation could be obtained in the absence of extracellular calcium. It is suggested that HL-60, THP-1, and DAUDI cells interact with a specific receptor on the endothelial cell and as a result of this interaction the endothelial cells are stimulated to release EDRF.
