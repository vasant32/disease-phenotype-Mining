 BACKGROUND: Burkitt lymphoma is frequent a cancer in the developing countries where its treatment is based on non-intensive chemotherapy protocols. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness and the toxicity of a non-intensive chemotherapy protocol combining cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in children with Burkitt lymphoma of the maxillofacial region. PROCEDURE: A retrospective descriptive study was carried out in patients with Burkitt lymphoma of maxillofacial region who received at least one weekly treatment with intravenous cyclophosphamide and methotrexate between 1999 and 2006 in a university teaching hospital in Burkina Faso. The demographic characteristics of the patients, the effectiveness and the toxicity of the treatment were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 58 patients were included. The mean age was 7.2 years. According to Murphy's staging, 28 patients (48%) were at stage I, 18 (31%) at stage II, 11 (19%) at stage III and 1 (2%) at stage IV. Among 28 patients who received all the cycles of the protocol, 21 (75%) achieved complete remission, 6 (21%) had partial remission and 1 (4%) had progressive disease. The major complications during the treatment were febrile leucopenia and anemia. The mortality rate was 19% (11/58). CONCLUSION: Non-intensive chemotherapy protocol with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate could be an alternative to intensive chemotherapy protocols for the management of the stage I-III endemic Burkitt lymphoma in developing countries.
