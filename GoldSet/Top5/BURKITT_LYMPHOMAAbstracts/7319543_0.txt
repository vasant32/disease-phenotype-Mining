The C3b receptor was isolated from detergent-solubilized human erythrocyte membranes by a previously described technique (1). The receptor glycoprotein was shown to enhance EAC14oxy23b rosette formation with Raji lymphoblastoid cells. This provided a specific and sensitive test to detect the solubilized C3b receptor either in crude or highly purified form. The property of the C3b receptor tested by this assay appears to be analogous to properties of beta 1H.
