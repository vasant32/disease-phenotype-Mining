BACKGROUND: In a series of 1005 cases of Burkitt's lymphoma studied for epidemiological and clinical characteristics, some features remain less obvious contrary to what is commonly held about this disease. OBJECTIVES: To use the case series to document the challenges in the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) in Kenya. DESIGN: Cross sectional study involving clinical review of case series. SETTING: Kenyatta National Hospital and the seven provincial hospitals in Kenya during the period between 1986 and 1996. DATA SOURCES: Systematic review of the epidemiological and clinical features of the 1005 cases enrolled in the case study and review of reference lists of retrieved articles to identify original research dealing with the epidemiological and clinical features of Burkitt's lymphoma. DATA EXTRACTION: The investigators and research assistants screened both the case series and published information and data to yield relevant information. CONCLUSION: The majority of Burkitt's lymphoma cases between the age group three and nine years of age coincide with the established epidemiological and clinical characteristics. The adult BL cases and some childhood cases however do not conform entirely to the established characteristics. Therefore, making the diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma require that; geographical, demographical, clinical features as well as any underlying infections for instance, Human Immunodeficiency Virus be taken into consideration.
