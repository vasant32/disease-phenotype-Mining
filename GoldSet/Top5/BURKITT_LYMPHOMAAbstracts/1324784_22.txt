To search for possible antitumor promoters, we carried out a primary screening of thirty-seven dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenes from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook fil. var. regelii Makino and Euonymus sieboldianus Blume, using their possible inhibitory effects on the Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) activation which is induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells. Some of these sesquiterpenes, triptofordin F-2 (Takaishi et al., 1988), 1,2,6,8,15-pentaacetoxy-9-benzoyloxy-4-hydroxy-beta-dihydroagarofuran and triptogelin A-1 (Takaishi et al., 1990) were observed to significantly inhibit the EBV-EA activation at low doses. Based on the results, the structural requirements for the activity of these compounds were discussed [corrected].
