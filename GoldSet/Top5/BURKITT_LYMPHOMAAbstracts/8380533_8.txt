We report a case of a posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) which presented in a liver allograft shortly after transplantation. The patient, who had been transplanted because of cirrhosis due to primary hemochromatosis and chronic hepatitis B infection (HBV), developed early recurrent HBV in the graft, and 2 months after transplantation, liver biopsies showed a malignant large-cell lymphoma. The neoplastic cells demonstrated Epstein-Barr virus DNA by in situ hybridization. The patient died 3.5 months posttransplant due to liver failure. At autopsy, the liver showed nodules of malignant lymphoma, massive hepatic necrosis, and iron overload, but no evidence of rejection. This report suggests that the grafted liver can be the site of PTLD in recurrent HBV and hemochromatosis.
