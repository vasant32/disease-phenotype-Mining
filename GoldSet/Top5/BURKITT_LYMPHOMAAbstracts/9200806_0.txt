Involvement of the genitourinary tract by lymphoproliferative disorders is rare. Rapid proliferating Burkitt's lymphomas could mimic acute diseases. Due to the extreme chemosensitivity, the lymphoma is cureable and surgery should be done only for histology. Initial surgery should be restricted to acute abdominal complications or complete removal of localised resectable disease. In any case a multiagent chemotherapy is necessary.
