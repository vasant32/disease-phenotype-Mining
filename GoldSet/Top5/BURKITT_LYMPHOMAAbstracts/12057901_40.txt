Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is difficult to accomplish using thin-sections of paraffin-embedded lymphoid tissue because of the high cellularity and truncated cells that interfere with accurate scoring of individual nuclei. We modified and tested a new technique to isolate individual nuclei from tissue cores of paraffin-embedded tissue processed with xylene, proteinase K, citric acid, and pepsin. The efficacy of this method to study paraffin-embedded tissue was investigated in six normal lymph nodes or tonsils and 32 malignant lymphomas including five mantle cell, five follicular, five Burkitt, five extranodal marginal zone lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, five anaplastic large-cell, and seven diffuse large B-cell. Fusion of CCND1 and IgH, BCL2 and IgH, c-myc and IgH, and MALT1 and API2 were detected using probes with a dual-fusion FISH strategy. Anomalies involving ALK and BCL6 were detected using break-apart FISH probes. FISH studies were successful for each of the 38 specimens. Chromosome anomalies were detected in each malignant specimen, but not in the normal lymphoid tissue. The correct chromosome anomaly was detected in 22 of 22 specimens with genetic abnormalities that were established by other genetic techniques. This FISH technique is useful to detect chromosome anomalies with high sensitivity and specificity in paraffin-embedded tissue and may provide important diagnostic and prognostic genetic information.
