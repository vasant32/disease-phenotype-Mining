Raji cells, a human B lymphoblastoid cell line of Burkitt lymphoma origin, formed lupus inclusions when grown in a medium conditioned by the growth of Raji cells whose DNA thymidine residues had been unifilarly (single-strandedly) substituted with bromodeoxyuridine. Ultracentrifugation of this medium in excess of that required to remove Epstein-Barr virus and all other known mammalian viruses did not prevent the formation of the inclusions, and treatment of the conditioned medium with pronase destroyed the activity. These results demonstrate the presence of a protein that is secreted from bromodeoxyuridine-substituted Raji cells and is capable of inducing nonbromodeoxyuridine-substituted cells to form lupus inclusions. Interferon (100 units per milliliter) was found in the conditioned medium. Inclusions also formed in Raji cells grown in fresh medium supplemented with human leukocyte or fibroblast interferon (100 units per milliliter).
