The regulatory effects of the combined treatment of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and interferon alpha (IFN alpha) on the growth and differentiation of Daudi lymphoma cells were investigated. By means of anti-BrdU monoclonal antibodies and [3H-thymidine] incorporation a reduced proliferation rate was shown both through a combination of TNF alpha with either IL-1 alpha or IFN alpha and, above all, through simultaneous treatment with the three cytokines. In parallel, the degree of differentiation was evaluated via morphological criteria and detection of Fc receptors (FcR) and appeared higher after treatment with the three cytokines. Our results provide evidence of the increased sensitivity of this cell line to this combined treatment supporting the existence of a synergistic interaction in inducing the antiproliferative and differentiative effects.
