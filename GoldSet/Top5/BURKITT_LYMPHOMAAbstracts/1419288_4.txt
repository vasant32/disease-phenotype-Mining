14 adult patients between 16 and 50 years old with small non-cleaved cell lymphoma (Burkitt's lymphoma) were prospectively treated from 1982 to 1990 with the LMB protocols of the Société Française d'Oncologie Pédiatrique (SFOP). No HIV-positive patients were included. All patients had extensive disease with bad prognosis factors, i.e. 10 patients had Murphy stage III and 4 had stage IV with bone marrow involvement. The LMB protocols were characterised by high-dose fractionated cyclophosphamide, high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX), and cytosine arabinoside. No local or central nervous system irradiation was used. Treatment duration ranged from 5 (LMB 84) to 12 (LMB 81) months. There were no therapy-related deaths. All patients achieved complete remission (CR). 6 patients relapsed between 2 and 30 months following CR. 8 of the 14 patients (57%) are still alive and disease-free after treatment by LMB protocol alone. 2 patients were salvaged with bone marrow transplantation after relapse and a total of 10 out of 14 patients (71%) are disease-free at the time of this report. Our results showed the high curability of advanced Burkitt's lymphoma using a paediatric protocol, even in adult patients. The LMB protocol may be applied to adult patients but requires intensive care during the induction period.
