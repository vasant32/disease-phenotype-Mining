The HIV epidemic in the Asian subcontinent has a significant impact on India. Patients with AIDS have an increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In this study, we have investigated the pattern of distribution of lymphoid neoplasms and also studied the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-association and p53 expression in 35 HIV-positive patients from India. The biopsy samples were studied for histology and for expression of CD20, CD3, CD15, CD30, light chains, CD138, bcl-6, epithelial membrane antigen, EBV-latent membrane protein-1, and p53 protein. In situ hybridization was performed with digoxigenin-labeled anti-sense EBV-encoded nuclear RNA-1 (EBER-1) probe. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on DNA extracted from paraffin sections for EBV-subtype analysis. The 35 cases included 7 cases of Hodgkin disease (HD), 4 cases of plasmacytoma (PL), and 24 cases of NHL. Among the cases of NHL, 3 were Burkitt lymphoma (BL), 4 were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBL) of centroblastic type (CBL), 10 were DLBL of immunoblastic type (IBL), 4 were high-grade B-cell lymphoma (unspecified) and the rest were other subtypes. EBV-association was noted in all cases of HD, 2 of 3 BL, and 3 of 10 IBL. PCR analysis of the EBNA-3C gene revealed amplimers corresponding to type A. A p53 protein overexpression was noted in 6 of 10 IBLs, 1 of 3 BLs, 2 of 3 CBLs, and 5 of 7 cases of HD. This is the first reported study of lymphoid malignancies in HIV-positive individuals from India.
