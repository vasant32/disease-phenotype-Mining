The association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA with African tumors was examined by the method of hybridization with complementary RNA. 22 out of 23 biopsies of Burkitt's lymphoma and 18 out of 23 biopsies of nasopharyngeal carcinoma were found to contain EBV DNA. The number of EBV genome equivalents per cell ranged from four to 113. Five out of 24 other African tumors, two adenocarcinomas, and one each of melanoma, reticulum cell sarcoma, and carcinoma of the antrum, also contained EBV DNA.
