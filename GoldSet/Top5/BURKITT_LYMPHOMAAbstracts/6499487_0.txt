An unusual case of American Burkitt's lymphoma originating in the stomach of an elderly man is presented. Computed tomography revealed diffuse infiltration of the gastric wall by a solid tumor measuring 2.5 to 5.5 cm in thickness. Despite such bulky tumor, however, distensibility of the stomach was preserved because Burkitt's lymphoma does not induce desmoplastic reaction and linitis plastica.
