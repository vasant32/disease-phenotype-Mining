Placement of Broviac catheters for venous access resulted in metastatic tumor implantation along the catheter tracts in an adult with multiple myeloma and in a child with Burkitt's lymphoma. Both complications occurred in the setting of advanced malignancy. The tissue injury produced during the creation of the catheter tunnel may create an environment favorable for metastatic tumor growth. Swelling along catheter tunnel tracts will most frequently result from hematoma or infection, but the rare occurrence of tumor implantation should be considered. Biopsy is diagnostic.
