Cell surface galactosyl-glycoprotein patterns were compared between Ramos and BJAB, two Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative Burkitt lymphoma lines, and their acutely EBV-superinfected and stably EBV-converted derivatives. A major difference between Ramos and its EBV-infected variants was the appearance of a 69,000 mol. wt. galactosyl-glycoprotein (GP69) in the latter. The same phenomenon was found in BJAB along with the additional appearance of a 71,000 mol. wt. galactosyl-glycoprotein (GP71) in the EBV-infected cells. GP71 was present in Ramos and in its EBV-converted derivatives.
