Targeted suicide gene therapy for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated neoplasms was attempted by using EBV-based plasmid vectors coupled with hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-liposome in vitro. Expression of EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA)1 is a common feature of the neoplasms associated with EBV. When various leukemic cell lines were transduced with a vector carrying a marker gene and EBV replication origin of plasmid (oriP), the marker gene product was exclusively detected in cells expressing EBNA1. Transduction of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 thymidine kinase (Tk) gene resulted in a marked reduction in viable cell number by ganciclovir (GCV) specifically in EBNA1 positive cells. The results demonstrate that this virus-free system may be applicable to gene therapy of EBV-associated neoplasms.
