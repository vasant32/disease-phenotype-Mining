In order to test the numerous variable biological parameters which may contribute to the efficiency of the immunomagnetic depletion method, experiments have been carried out with different Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. The Hoechst dye method, a sensitive assay able to detect 3 log elimination, and a liquid culture assay suitable for identifying an elimination greater than 4 logs, were used to measure malignant cell elimination. These assays showed that the separation of bone marrow mononuclear cells on Ficoll-hypaque, the use of beads in excess, and a double treatment of the samples are needed to obtain optimal depletion of malignant cells. Under these conditions, the immunomagnetic procedure is capable of depleting 1% tumour cell infiltration at the lower limit of detection of a very sensitive culture assay (i.e. greater than 4 log elimination).
