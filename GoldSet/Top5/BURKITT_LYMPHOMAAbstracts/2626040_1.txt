The activity of RU38486 has been studied in Burkitt's lymphoma cells which are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive. The early antigens (EA) of the virus are induced by dexamethasone (DXM) in Daudi but not in Raji cells, whereas a growth factor (transforming growth factor-beta, TGF-beta) induces the EA in both cell lines. RU38486 blocks the EA induction obtained by DXM or by TGF-beta in either cell line. In order to understand the interaction of RU38486, we considered its binding to specific receptors. We first investigated the binding of the antagonist in whole cells at 22 degrees C. A number of specific binding sites higher for RU38486 than for DXM was found, suggesting that RU38486 may bind to the glucocorticoid receptor and also to other cellular structures which we called the antiglucocorticoid binding sites ("AGBS"). To support this hypothesis, competition experiments have been conducted between RU38486 and other steroid hormones (progesterone and testosterone) since it is known that RU38486 is also able to interact with their cognate receptors. Binding studies of RU38486 in vitro at 4 degrees C in the presence of cytosolic extracts from Daudi and Raji cells led to conclusions similar to those drawn from the whole cell experiments: more complexes were formed with RU38486 than with DXM. Finally, the steroid-receptor complexes were incubated with DNA-cellulose. Since the binding measured for RU38486 was higher than for DXM, we suspect that sites different from the classical glucocorticoid receptor sites are also able to interact with DNA. The blockage exerted by RU38486 on the EA induced by glucocorticoids or by non-steroidal molecules and the lack of responsiveness to glucocorticoids in Raji cells are discussed in the light of the present findings.
