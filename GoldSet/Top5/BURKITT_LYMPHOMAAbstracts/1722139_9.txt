Burkitt lymphoma (BL) lines can be grouped according to phenotypic characteristics. Group I cells exhibit the phenotype of resting B cells and grow as single cells. Such lines can be Epstein-Barr-virus(EBV)-negative or -positive. Group II and group III cells are always EBV-positive, they express B cell activation markers, grow in aggregates and resemble in varying degrees lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). We studied three groups of BL lines for their capacity to interact with allogeneic lymphocytes. The results showed that as long as the lines have the group I phenotype, they do not stimulate allogeneic T lymphocytes irrespective whether they carry the EBV genome. The group II and III cells are stimulatory. Generally there was no correlation between sensitivity ot lymphocyte-mediated lysis and the phenotype of the lines. In one set of lines, the group I cells had higher sensitivity to both natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer effectors compared to the group II or III lines. However, such correlation could not be seen with the other two sets of lines. Among the phenotypic features investigated, expression of the adhesion molecules LFA-1 and LFA-3 correlated with the tendency for cell aggregation.
