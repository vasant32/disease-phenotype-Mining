B-cell antigen receptor signaling is initiated upon binding of the antigen to membrane-bound immunoblobulin (Ig), and the anti-Ig antibody (Ab) mimics this signaling. In B cells latently infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the same signals induce virus activation. We examine here whether rheumatoid factors (RFs), autoantibodies directed against the Fc portion of IgG, induce EBV and B-cell activation. As a source of RFs, RF-producing lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) clones were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and synovial cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by EBV transformation. Burkitt's lymphoma-derived Akata cells, which are highly responsive to EBV activation by anti-Ig Abs, were used for the assay of EBV activation. Akata cells expressed IgG3 as membrane-bound Ig. RFs from a synovium-derived LCL were directed to IgG3 and induced EBV activation in 16 to 18% of Akata cells, whereas RFs from another synovium-derived LCL were directed to IgG1 and did not induce EBV activation. Pretreatment of RFs with the purified Fc fragment of human IgG completely abolished EBV activation. Furthermore, B-cell activation was assessed by incorporation of [3H]thymidine. RFs from synovium-derived LCLs efficiently induced B-cell activation, and the addition of CD40 ligand had a synergistic effect. On the other hand, RFs from PBMC-derived LCLs were polyreactive, had a lower affinity to IgG, and did not induce EBV and B-cell activation. The present findings imply a possible role for RFs as EBV and B-cell activators.
