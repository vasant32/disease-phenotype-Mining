Apoptosis in B cells is induced through the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and affects the sialic acid recognition molecules on B cells. We investigated the effects of alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP), which mainly contains alpha2,6-linked sialic acid, on anti-IgM antibody (Ab)-induced apoptosis in Ramos cells, which are derived from Burkitt's lymphoma. When Ramos cells were incubated with anti-IgM-Ab in plates coated with AGP, neuraminidase-digested AGP (asAGP) or alpha2,3-sialylated AGP (2,3AGP), apoptosis was suppressed only in those coated with AGP. We also studied the effects of CD22, which is expressed on the surface of mature B cells and binds to sugar chains containing alpha2,6-linked sialic acid, with anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Anti-CD22mAb enhanced anti-IgM Ab-induced apoptosis in Ramos cells. These contradictory results suggested that the recognition molecules for alpha2,6-linked sialic acid on AGP, which inhibits B-cell apoptosis, is distinct from CD22, or that different binding domains of CD22 between alpha2,6-linked sialic acid and anti-CD22 mAb exert opposite functions of suppression or enhancement to anti-IgM Ab-induced B cells.
