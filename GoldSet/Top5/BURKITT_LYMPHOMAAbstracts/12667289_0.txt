The aim of this study was to investigate whether and how phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors modulate the proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis in lymphoma cells. The effects of aminophylline (AM), a non-specific PDE inhibitor, on Raji cells were explored in vitro. MTT assay, light and transmission electron microscopy and annexin V staining were used to observe cell proliferation, morphologic changes and apoptosis rate in AM-treated cells, and FCM and RT-PCR techniques were adopted to detect the effect on cell cycle, the expression of cyclin B1 and Bcl-2 and mitochondrial transmembrane potential in AM-treated cells. The results showed that AM inhibited the growth of Raji cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Morphologic observations showed apoptosis changes in AM-treated cells, including cytoplamic shrinkage, cytoplasmic bubbling, karyopyknosis and nuclear fragmentation. FCM and RT-PCR detection showed that AM intervention increased the fraction of annexin V(+) cells, reduced the value of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, induced S phase arrest, and down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 at both mRNA and protein level and cyclin B1 protein in a concentration-dependent manner. It is concluded that PDE inhibitor aminophylline may induce Raji cell growth inhibition, S phase arrest, apoptosis via down-regulation of Bcl-2 and reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential.
