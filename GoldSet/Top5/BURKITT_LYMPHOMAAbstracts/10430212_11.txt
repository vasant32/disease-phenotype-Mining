We examined incidence trends in seven HIV-associated cancers (Kaposi's sarcoma [KS], invasive cervical cancer, immunoblastic lymphoma, primary brain lymphoma [PBL], Burkitt's lymphoma, other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and Hodgkin's lymphoma) and the effects of antiretroviral therapy on these trends. Data were abstracted from medical records in 89 hospitals and clinics in nine U.S. cities from January 1994 through June 1997. The stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic was used to test for trend. There were 19,684 HIV-infected persons representing 26,638 years of follow-up. Decreases in incidence per 1000 person-years were observed for KS (January through June 1994, 49.9; January through June 1997, 25.7; p = .001) and PBL (January through June 1994, 8.0; January through June 1997, 2.3; p = .01), especially during time on antiretroviral therapy, but changes in the incidence of other cancers were not significant. During the study, prescription of combination antiretroviral therapy increased from 16% to 57%. The incidences of KS and PBL are decreasing. Although for KS the decline occurred in both treated and untreated groups (difference in rate of decline not significant, p = .08), it was sharper in the treated group; additionally, KS declined faster in the era after highly active antiretroviral agents were introduced. Thus, these decreases may be due in part to the effect of antiretroviral therapy slowing the progression of HIV disease.
