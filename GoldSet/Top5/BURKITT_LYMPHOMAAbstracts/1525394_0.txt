Lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells generated in the presence of cisplatin/FK-565 along with interleukin-2 (IL-2) showed enhanced binding to tumor cells as compared with LAK cells generated in the presence of IL-2 alone. The LAK cells showed a reorientation of cellular organelles in the presence of tumor cells. LAK-tumor conjugate pairs showed vesicle-like structures in the extracellular pockets. The number of vesicles in the extracellular pockets was found to be increased in the case of LAK cells generated in the presence of cisplatin/FK-565 along with IL-2. The closer interaction between the LAK cell-target cell and the large number of vesicles in the extracellular space of conjugate pairs may explain the increased lysis of target cells by LAK cells generated in the presence of cisplatin/FK-565 along with IL-2 as compared with IL-2 alone.
