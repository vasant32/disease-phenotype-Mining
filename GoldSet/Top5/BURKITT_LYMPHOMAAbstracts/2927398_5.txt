We examined the structure and expression of the myc protooncogene in DNA extracted from a primary (uncultured) endemic Burkitt's lymphoma sample designated eBL3. Dot and Northern (RNA) blot analyses demonstrated extreme levels of myc RNA in the eBL3 sample. Nearly complete sequence data of the altered myc locus isolated from eBL3 DNA demonstrated extensive mutations (duplications, insertions, and deletions) in critical myc regulatory regions. Taken together, the data support the idea that myc transcriptional deregulation in Burkitt's lymphoma disease may be a consequence of the position and number of mutations produced within and around the myc locus. Furthermore, the myc exon-1-intron-1 hypermutable PvuII site is part of a potential heptamer-nonamer recognition sequence, suggesting a mechanism for mutation in endemic Burkitt's lymphoma disease.
