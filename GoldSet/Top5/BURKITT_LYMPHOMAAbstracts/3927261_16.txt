We have cloned and sequenced a rearranged V lambda gene from a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line PA682(PB). This cell line has two rearranged kappa loci and has been shown to be expressing kappa light chains. This V lambda gene has been identified as a member of the V lambda subgroup III gene family based on the homology of the predicted amino acid sequence of PAV lambda with the reported sequences of the V lambda protein DEL of subgroup III. Nine cross-hybridizing bands have been detected on Southern blots and the chromosomal orientation of the V lambda subgroup III gene family has been determined in relation to the V lambda subgroup I gene family. Although the PAV lambda rearrangement has occurred via a legitimate V-J joining and a normal size transcript is detected on Northern blots, the nucleotide sequence reveals a high level of mutations resulting in multiple termination signals within the V gene coding sequence and only a truncated V lambda protein can be translated. This confirms previous observations that although multiple light chain genes may be transcribed, only one functional light chain protein can be synthesized.
