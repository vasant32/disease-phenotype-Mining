Two cases of primary intracranial malignant lymphoma are reported. Case 1 was a 65-year-old female who was operated on for a left frontoparietal tumor in 1966 at our hospital, and the tumor was diagnosed as reticulum cell sarcoma histologically. Irradiation was also done. Thereafter, she had had no serious trouble except for slight right hemiparesis. In March of 1982, right hemiparesis became worse and disturbance of consciousness also appeared. CT scan and left carotid angiogram revealed a left fronto-temporoparietal tumor. Subtotal removal of the tumor was performed on the 1st of April. The tumor was diagnosed as malignant lymphoma, of large cell type. Chemotherapy was started postoperatively and marked decrease of enhanced area was observed in the CT scan taken on the 9th of July. But the patient showed melena and was diagnosed as having rectal adenocarcinoma histologically by biopsied specimen. Case 2 was a 48-year-old male who had been suffering from left facial palsy and vertigo since August, 1981. Those symptoms gradually progressed. On the 4th of December, he was admitted to our clinic. On admission, neurologically, multiple cranial nerve involvement was noticed such as of the IIIrd, IVth, Vth and VIth nerves bilaterally, and the VIIth, IXth, Xth and XIth cranial nerves on the left side. Right hemihypalgesia, thermohypesthesia, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis, and cerebellar taxia were also seen. CT scan and left vertebral angiogram revealed a tumor in the pons and IVth ventricle. On December 8th, suboccipital craniectomy was performed, but almost all of the tumor seemed growing under the floor of the IVth ventricle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
