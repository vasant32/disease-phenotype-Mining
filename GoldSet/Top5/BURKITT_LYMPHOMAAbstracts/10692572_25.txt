The activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB often results in protection against apoptosis. In particular, pro-apoptotic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signals are blocked by proteins that are induced by NF-kappaB such as TNFR-associated factor 1 (TRAF1). Here we show that TRAF1 is cleaved after Asp-163 when cells are induced to undergo apoptosis by Fas ligand (FasL). The C-terminal cleavage product blocks the induction of NF-kappaB by TNF and therefore functions as a dominant negative (DN) form of TRAF1. Our results suggest that the generation of DN-TRAF1 is part of a pro-apoptotic amplification system to assure rapid cell death.
