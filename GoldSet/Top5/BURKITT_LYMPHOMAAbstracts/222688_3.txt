Infection of a human lymphoblastoid cell line (Jijoye line derived from a Burkitt lymphoma which contains Epstein-Barr virus) with equine herpesvirus 1, maintained and observed for 53 days, was characterized by the continuous production of infectious extracellular and intracellular virus. Maximum virus production correlated with active cell multiplication. Less than 15% of the cells possessed viral capsid antigen at any one time. Five percent of the cells in the Jijoye line possess Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen; 80% of the Epstein-Barr viral caspid-containing cells also contained equine herpesvirus 1 antigen as detected by double staining. The interaction of equine herpesvirus 1 and lymphoblastoid cells provides a useful in vitro model which may help clarify the mechanism for herpesvirus latency.
