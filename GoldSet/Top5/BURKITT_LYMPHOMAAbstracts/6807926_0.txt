A 15-year-old girl presented with swelling and spontaneous bleeding of the gingiva. The lower anterior teeth were sensitive to percussion, and the lower lip and chin showed lack of sensation. Radiographically, gross loss of the alveolar and basal bone in both jaws was evident. The lamina dura and periodontal ligament had lost their morphology. Based on the clinical, radiographic and laboratory findings, the diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma cell leukemia was made. While cytotoxic medication brought about an immediate clinical improvement, radiographically, jaw bone repair became evident one month following initiation of treatment.
