This work reports the identification of the first case of a KÎ¡C-2-producing Pseudomonas putida isolate (PP36) in Brazil. The PP36 isolate was resistant to all the antimicrobials tested except polymyxin B. In addition to the discovered bla(KPC-2) gene, genetic analysis showed the presence of a class 1 integron containing the dhfrXVb gene and the new allele arr-6, which codes for resistance to rifampin. These elements were found in an IncFI 65-kb plasmid.
