Retinol, 5 flavonoids, 3 steroids and 7 sweetening agents were studied for their effects on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced early antigen (EA) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in Raji cells. Concomitant treatment of Raji cells with TPA and retinol showed inhibition of EA induction. Among flavonoids, quercetin resulted in effective inhibition of EA induction by TPA and alpha-naphthoflavone showed the weakly inhibitory effect. None of the other flavonoids such as rutin, catechin and beta-naphthoflavone affected the induction of EBV-EA by TPA. beta-Estradiol obviously inhibited EBV-EA induction by TPA, but hydrocortisone did not show any inhibitory effect on it. Glycyrrhetinic acid, steviol, phyllodulcin and perrillartine also showed the remarkable inhibition of EBV-EA induction. On the other hand, glycyrrhizin and stevioside, glycosides of glycyrrhetinic acid and steviol, did not inhibit the induction of EBV-EA by TPA. Some of the inhibitors reported here may be effective on the inhibition of the in vivo tumor promotion by TPA.
