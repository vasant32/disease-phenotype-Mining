BACKGROUND: Cancer is a major health problem in developed countries and epidemiological evidence shows the emergence of a similar tend in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV/AIDS is predicted to augment the cancer burden. The present study analyses the profile of cancers recorded in the first decade (1995-2004) of establishment of the Kano cancer registry (KCR) a histology/cytology-based registry in Kano, Nigeria. METHODS: Records of cancer cases diagnosed based on histology or cytology and entered into the registry were retrieved and categorized by type/organ sites affected according to International Classification of Diseases for Oncology RESULTS: There was a steady rise in frequency of cancer over the period where a total of 1990 cancer cases were recorded comprising of 1001 (50.3%) males and 989 (49.7%) females. Cancers of the cervix (22.9%), Breast (18.9%), Ovary (8.2%), non-melanoma skin cancer (6.3%), and Uterus (6.2%) were the most frequent female cancers. In males, cancer of the prostate (16.5%), bladder (10.2%), non-melanoma skin (9.9%), colorectum (9.3%) and connective tissue (6.3%) were most common. Burkitt's lymphoma (31.4%), other lymphoreticular cancers (23.8%) and retinoblastoma (20%) predominated in children. CONCLUSION: The KCR supports existing predictions of an increase in incidence of cancers in developing countries. There is need for establishment of comprehensive cancer control programmes in developing countries for the common cancers of the cervix, breast, prostate, bladder, skin and colorectum which are amenable to prevention, early detection and cure.
