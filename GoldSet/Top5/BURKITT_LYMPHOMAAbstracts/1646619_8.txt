We tested the effect of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 on the proliferation of human B cell lines. The panel was selected to give information whether (1) their origin, (2) their phenotype, (3) their Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) carrier state, influence their responsiveness. The growth of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) was not inhibited by TGF-beta 1. The EBV-carrying Burkitt lymphoma (BL) lines, Daudi, Jijoye, Rael but not Raji were inhibited. Three EBV-negative BL lines and the majority of their converted sublines were sensitive. The cell lines tested expressed TGF-beta receptors and TGF-beta 1 transcripts. The proliferation of EBV-infected B cells was inhibited by TGF-beta, their sensitivity decreased, however, after 3 days. The results suggest that the activation state of the B cells is decisive for TGF-beta sensitivity and EBV influences it indirectly by changing the cell phenotype.
