A new monoclonal antibody specific for human B cell differentiation antigen (HLB-1) is produced by a hybridoma established by fusion of splenocytes of mice immunized with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed peripheral B cell line, RPMI-8057. This monoclonal, antibody designated anti-HLB-1 monoclonal antibody (anti-HLB-1), reacted with surface immunoglobulin (sIg)-positive B cells of normal peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues and sIg-positive leukemic cells. The cells of T cell leukemia, non-T non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and nonlymphoid leukemia were HLB-1 negative. These data were further confirmed by studying a panel of cultured human hematopoietic cell lines. Anti-HLB-1 reacted with B cell lines derived from pre-B, Burkitt's lymphoma, B cell type ALL and EBV-transformed peripheral B cells. Anti-HLB-1 was reactive with only one of three human myeloma cell lines, and with none of the T cell, myeloid and non-T non-B ALL cell lines. This newly defined HLB-1 antigen is different from other conventional human B cell markers such as sIg, Ia antigens, and receptors for the Fc portion of Ig and complement C3.
