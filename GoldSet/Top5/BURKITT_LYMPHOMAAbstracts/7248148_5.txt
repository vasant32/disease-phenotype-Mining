Between 1965 and 1978, 430 cases of Burkitt's lymphoma were evaluated at the Burkitt Tumour Project, Accra, Ghana. During this period a change in the presenting features occurred, in which abdominal disease increased and facial disease decreased. This change was especially apparent in males, in whom the proportion of cases with abdominal disease more than doubled (chi 2 time trend = 25.99, P = 0.00000017) We speculate that the change may be related to possible changes in BL incidence.
