High MRD levels before transplantation in children receiving T cell-depleted unrelated grafts for relapsed ALL were associated with a 100% relapse risk. We report on two children with relapsed ALL who underwent non T cell-depleted BMT from unrelated donors. Despite a high residual tumor load pre- transplant and the occurrence of only aGVHD grade I, they are still in second complete remission 2.7 and 5.2 years after transplantation, respectively. Thus, we propose that the transplant regimens influence the prognostic significance of high MRD levels pre-BMT.
