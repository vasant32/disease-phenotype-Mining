A new translocation between chromosomes 2 and 8, t(2p-; 8q+), was found in fresh lymphoma cells from a Japanese patient with Epstein-Barr virus-carrying Burkitt's lymphoma, and in a lymphoma cell line derived from this patient. There was no 14q+ translocation, as has been previously described in African and North American Burkitt's lymphomas.
