Lymph nodes or tumor biopsies of 60 persons suspected of having a malignant lymphoma were examined for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) by anticomplement immunofluorescence. In 8 cases the tissue specimens were also assayed for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA by nucleic acid hybridization. Serum samples of patients and controls were tested for EBV-related antibodies. The histological tests in 37 cases showed a malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and in 23 cases a reactive lymphadenopathy. A Burkitt lymphoma of a European boy and a polymorphic centroblastoma contained EBNA and approximately 27 or 30 genome equivalents EBV DNA per cell, respectively. EBNA was also demonstrated in about 20% of the cells of a lymph node from a patient with recurrent reactive lymphadenopathy.
