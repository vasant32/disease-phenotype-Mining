Phospholipid methylase and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities were studied in human B lymphoïd hemopathies (51 patients: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia) and compared with activities in lymphoblastïd and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines and with normal B lymphocytes: methylase activity proved to be lower in ALL and high grade lymphoma and inversely related to the percent of cells in S phase state; the A/G ratio of phosphodiesterases was low in ALL and CLL and high in hairy cell leukemia and it was related to the percent of cells in S phase state.
