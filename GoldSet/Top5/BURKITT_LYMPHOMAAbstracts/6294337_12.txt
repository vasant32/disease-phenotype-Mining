The diterpene ester promoter of mouse skin tumors, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, induced a DNase activity in the Epstein-Barr virus-producer cell line P3HR-1. The elution patterns of the enzyme from DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, and DNA-cellulose columns were different from virus-associated DNA polymerase activity. The partially purified activity could be neutralized to the extent of 90% by sera of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Purified immunoglobulin G from sera of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients inhibited this enzyme and that obtained from superinfected Raji cells to the same extent. The partially purified enzyme preferred native DNA as a substrate over denatured DNA and 3'-terminally labeled activated calf thymus DNA. The activity was inhibited by high ionic strength. Phosphonoformic acid did not have any effect on this enzyme activity.
