Lym-2 is a murine monoclonal antibody (MoAb) directed towards a human class II molecule variant reactive with both normal and neoplastic human B lymphocytes. Previous studies have shown that signals transmitted by class II molecules that stimulate normal lymphocytes can be inhibitory for B-cell lymphoma growth by signaling activation-induced cell death. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the effects of nonconjugated murine Lym-2 and a human-mouse chimeric Lym-2 (chCLL-1; with murine variable regions and human constant regions) MoAb on the growth of various human lymphomas by using both in vitro and in vivo assays. Cell lines derived from Burkitt's lymphomas, diffuse large cell B-cell lymphomas, anaplastic large-cell lymphomas, and Epstein-Barr virus-induced B-cell lymphomas were incubated with Lym-2 or chCLL-1 in vitro, and effects on proliferation were determined by [3H]-thymidine incorporation. The effects of Lym-2 in vitro were also compared with those of Lym-1, which is a similar MoAb that has been evaluated clinically. After immobilization, which enhances crosslinking of the MoAbs, both Lym-2 and chCLL-1 were capable of directly inhibiting the growth of various lymphoma lines in vitro. These human lymphomas were then transferred into mice with severe combined immunodeficiency to evaluate the efficacy of these MoAbs in vivo. Treatment with either murine Lym-2 or the chimeric chCLL-1 were significantly effective in improving the survival of tumor-bearing mice. These results indicate that stimulation by nonconjugated chCLL-1 may offer a biological approach to the treatment of various human lymphomas.
