A protein of molecular weight approximately 200,000, which exists in trace amounts in calf serum, is specifically phosphorylated by an enzyme located at the surface of cultured cells. The emzymatic reaction utilizes ATP, is enhanced by Mg++ and Zn++ ions, and is not dependent on cyclic AMP. This kinase activity is associated with normal growing fibroblasts but disappears when they are contact-inhibited. It remains high, however, in transformed and malignant cells, whatever their growth state.
