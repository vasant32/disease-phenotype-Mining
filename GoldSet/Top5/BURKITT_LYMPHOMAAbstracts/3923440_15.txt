A cDNA library was constructed from the mRNA of the Ig lambda producing Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, EB4. Overlapping clones encompassing the coding sequence of the Ig lambda mRNA were isolated and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence shows a short hydrophobic leader peptide and a mature polypeptide of 217 residues in which V, J and C regions can be distinguished. The V region belongs to subgroup VI and has greatest homology (80%) with the Amyloid-AR protein. The constant region is the Kern- Oz+ isotype. Probing normal human DNA with the subcloned V lambda coding sequence detects one gene at high stringency and a family of 11 members at low stringency. To date, no restriction enzyme site polymorphisms have been detected. The V lambda VI gene is rearranged on both chromosomes of EB4 and is deleted on both chromosomes in the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BL2.
