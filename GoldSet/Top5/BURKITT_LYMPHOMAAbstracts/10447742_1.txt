The Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Daudi is a potent inducer of human gammadelta T-cell expansion. Using an in vitro culture system comprised of irradiated Daudi cells as stimulators and normal human lymphocytes as responders, the cellular determinants of this response were investigated. Three of four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs 1-1C4, L243, and 9.3F10) directed against disparate epitopes of human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, as well as a mAb with specificity for CD4 (OKT4), inhibited the expansion of gammadelta T cells in response to Daudi cell stimulators. mAbs with a specificity for CD74 and CD8 were non-inhibitory. Lymphocyte depletion experiments demonstrated a critical role for the CD4+ T-cell subset in the expansion of gammadelta T cells. Other data pointed towards requirements for direct cell contact in this system, and the addition of exogenous recombinant interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and IL-12 failed to reconstitute gammadelta T-cell expansion in CD4+ lymphocyte-depleted cultures. These results complement previous findings in murine infectious disease and mycobacterial systems, providing a direct demonstration that CD4+ T cells play a role in gammadelta T-cell expansion through an interaction with human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II on Daudi cells. The data point towards important functional links between the acquired and natural immune systems.
