 CONTEXT: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been classically associated with 3 malignancies, Burkitt lymphoma, B-cell lymphoproliferative syndromes, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and more recently with Hodgkin disease, T-cell lymphomas, and gastric and breast carcinomas, as well as with leiomyosarcoma and leiomyoma associated with immunosuppression. OBJECTIVE: To compare EBV expression in Argentine tumor samples with those reported elsewhere, we analyzed EBV expression in an Argentine pediatric population with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and correlated these results with clinical course and outcome. METHODS: We studied EBV presence by latent membrane protein-1 protein labeling by immunohistochemistry, by in situ hybridization, and by polymerase chain reaction for Epstein-Barr-encoded RNAs (EBERs) in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded non-Hodgkin lymphoma tissue samples (collected retrospectively) from 32 pediatric patients at Ricardo Guti√©rrez Children's Hospital from 1993 to 2000. RESULTS: Eight out of the 32 (25%) non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases showed latent membrane protein-1 and EBERs by in situ hybridization positive staining in tumor cells. Among EBERs and latent membrane protein-1-positive cases, there were 5 immunocompromised patients, with either human immunodeficiency virus infection or primary immunodeficiency. The EBERs in situ hybridization results were confirmed by EBERs polymerase chain reaction in good-quality DNA from 11 samples, with 3 proving positive and 8 negative. CONCLUSIONS: The association of EBV with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the Argentine pediatric population was low (25%), and this figure rose to 100% when only the immunocompromised patients subgroup was considered, confirming that the virus is probably a cofactor in the lymphomagenesis of some but not all pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphoma. So far, no differences in clinical outcome are discernible between EBV-positive and EBV-negative non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients.
