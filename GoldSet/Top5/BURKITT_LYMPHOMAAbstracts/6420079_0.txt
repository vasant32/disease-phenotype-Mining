Normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) express several in vitro cytotoxic functions, among which are natural killer (NK), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (LDCC). The relationship of these various cytotoxic functions and the identity of cells involved has been a subject of controversy. Recently it was reported that NK and K for ADCC can be mediated by the same cell, suggesting that they constitute in large part a single subpopulation with multiple cytotoxic functions. The ability of this NK/K effector cell to mediate LDCC was examined here using the two target conjugate assay. The effector cells were Ficoll-Hypaque PBL or LGL-enriched fractions. The targets used were K562 or MOLT for NK, RAJI coated with antibody for ADCC, and RAJI coated with PHA or Con A or modified by NaIO4 for LDCC. In the two-target conjugate assay, one of the targets is fluorescein labeled for identification. The results show that (a) LDCC copurifies with NK/K and is enriched in the LGL fraction, as measured in both the 51Cr-release assay and the single-cell assay for cytotoxicity; (b) single effector cells simultaneously bind to NK or ADCC and LDCC targets, revealing that single cells bear binding receptors for all targets; and (c) single lymphocytes were not able to kill both bound NK/K and LDCC targets. However, significant two-target killing was obtained when both targets were NK targets, ADCC targets, LDCC targets, or one NK and one ADCC target. These results demonstrate that the NK and LDCC effector cells are distinct subpopulations copurified in the LGL fraction. In addition, the results show that lectin is unable to trigger globally an NK effector cell to mediate cytotoxicity against a bound NK insensitive target. Thus, although both NK and LDCC effector cells are present in the LGL fraction and can bind to both types of targets, the trigger of the lethal hit event is the function of specialized effector cells.
