 BACKGROUND: To study the role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the carcinogenesis of various lymphoid neoplasms in Taiwan, a nonisotopic in situ hybridization (ISH) technique was used to detect the expression of EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) in various lymphoid neoplasms. METHODS: We obtained the paraffin-embedded tissues of various hematological malignancies from the Department of Pathology, Tri-Service General Hospital. Nonisotopic ISH technique was employed to detect EBERs and immunohistochemical staining was performed to confirm the cell lineage. RESULTS: Our data showed the frequency of EBV infection on various lymphoid malignancies as followed: Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) (10/18); non-Burkitt's Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (3/42); non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, T cell type, nasal (NHLTN) (5/5); Hodgkin's disease (2/9); acute lymphocytic leukemia (1/24); chronic lymphocytic leukemia (1/15); and multiple myeloma (2/18). In the control group, none of the specimens from patients of acute myelocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome was positive for EBERs. CONCLUSIONS: Among the various lymphoid neoplasms we studied, only BL (p < 0.05) and NHLTN (p < 0.05) were found to have an association with EBV statistically.
