LL2 is a murine monoclonal antibody IgG2a reactive with B cells and non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma, which, in a radioiodinated form, induces responses in lymphoma patients [Goldenberg et al. (1991) J Clin Oncol 9:548-564]. In this report we identify LL2 as a member of the CD22 cluster. The molecular size of the antigen, its expression profile, and competitive blocking studies were used to establish this identification. By Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation studies using the Raji Burkitt's lymphoma cell line metabolically labelled with [3H]leucine, the LL2 antigen was determined to correspond to a molecular mass of 140 kDa. The molecular mass of the LL2 antigen, and the B-cell-restricted reactivity of the LL2 antibody, were consistent with both the CD21 and CD22 clusters. To assess additional similarities and differences between LL2 and anti-CD22 and anti-CD21, the binding of these mAb to cultured cell lines, Nalm-6 and Molt-4, was compared by flow cytometry. The binding profile of LL2 on these cell lines was consistent with anti-CD22, but not anti-CD21. Sequential immunoprecipitation and cross-blocking studies with anti-CD22 monoclonal antibodies recognizing established CD22 epitopes were performed to confirm that LL2 reacts with CD22 and to determine which epitope LL2 recognizes. Binding of 131I-LL2 to Raji cells is inhibited over 90% by prior incubation of the target cells with unlabelled RFB4, indicating that LL2 belongs to the same epitope group as RFB4, i.e., epitope B.
