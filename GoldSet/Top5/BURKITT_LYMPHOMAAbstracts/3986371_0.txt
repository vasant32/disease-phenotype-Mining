The authors describe human cancer strains established from 6 cell lines transplanted to nude mice and rats: cancer of the liver, colon, lung, bladder and Burkitt's lymphoma. In spite of a long history (for several years) of cell line transfers in vitro, on transplantation of tumor cells, nude animals established tumors histologically identical to the primary cancer.
