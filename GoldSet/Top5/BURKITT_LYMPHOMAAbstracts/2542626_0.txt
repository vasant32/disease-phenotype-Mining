To study the effect of T-cell-derived BCGF-12kD on human B-cell autocrine growth-associated functions, we cultured Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-transformed normal B cells (LCL 72285) and Burkitt's lymphoma cells (Raji) in the presence or absence of BCGF-12kD. When cultured in media supplemented only with fetal calf serum, the LCL and Raji cell lines maintained relatively high levels of episomes. Although a similar level of proliferation could be maintained under defined culture conditions in media supplemented with BCGF-12kD, these conditions resulted in a time-dependent reduction of EBV sequences, as detected with EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA-1 and EBNA-2) gene probes. These results suggest that stimulation with T-cell-derived BCGF-12kD can alter a regulatory step which may be involved in the EBV transformation of B cells.
