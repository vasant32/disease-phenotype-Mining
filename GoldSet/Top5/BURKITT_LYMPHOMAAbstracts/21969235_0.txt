 PURPOSE: Intussusception is a recognised but unusual presenting feature of Burkitt lymphoma. We sought to identify the clinical features associated with intussusception in this setting, and assess the outcome following protocol directed chemotherapy. METHODS: A retrospective case note review was performed on patients treated for Burkitt lymphoma at our institution between 1976 and 2010. Cases presenting with intussusception were identified from hospital records and oncology database. RESULTS: Fourteen of the 210 children seen with a diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma during the study period (6.7%) developed intussusception. Median age was 6.1 years (range 2.5-10.9). Twelve patients presented with recurrent abdominal pain, and two patients with a jaw mass associated with endemic Burkitt lymphoma. Nine patients underwent a right hemicolectomy with ileo-colic anastomosis, and five had segmental small-bowel resections. Three patients had bone marrow involvement at diagnosis, two of whom died. All patients received chemotherapy. Median follow-up was 6.07 years (range 0.1-28.8). CONCLUSIONS: Small bowel lymphoma should be considered in children presenting with intussusception above the normal infantile peak age range. The presentation is often insidious, and complete obstruction may not be apparent. However, when surgically resected, the majority can achieve a good outcome with additional chemotherapy.
