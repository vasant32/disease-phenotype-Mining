The ubiquitous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is related to the development of lymphoma and is also the etiological agent for infectious mononucleosis (IM). Sequence variations in the gene encoding LMP1 have been deeply studied in different pathologies and geographic regions. Controversial results propose the existence of tumor-related variants, while others argued in favor of a geographical distribution of these variants. Reports assessing EBV variants in IM were performed in adult patients who displayed multiple variant infections. In the present study, LMP1 variants in 15 pediatric patients with IM and 20 pediatric patients with EBV-associated lymphomas from Argentina were analyzed as representatives of benign and malignant infections in children, respectively. A 3-month follow-up study of LMP1 variants in peripheral blood cells and in oral secretions of patients with IM was performed. Moreover, an integrated linkage analysis was performed with variants of EBNA1 and the promoter region of BZLF1. Similar sequence polymorphisms were detected in both pathological conditions, IM and lymphoma, but these differ from those previously described in healthy donors from Argentina and Brazil. The results suggest that certain LMP1 polymorphisms, namely, the 30-bp deletion and high copy number of the 33-bp repeats, are associated with EBV-related pathologies, either benign or malignant, instead of just being tumor related. Additionally, this is the first study to describe the Alaskan variant in EBV-related lymphomas that previously was restricted to nasopharyngeal carcinomas from North America.
