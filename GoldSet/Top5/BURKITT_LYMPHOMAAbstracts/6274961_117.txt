Two new cell surface antigens expressed on B lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) were defined with cytotoxic mouse monoclonal antibodies. One marker, BB-1 (for B lymphoblast antigen-1), was detected on human and nonhuman primate B-LCL, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-activated B cell blasts, most Burkitt's lymphomas, and Ia+ B lymphoblast-like myelomas. Polyclonal B cell activators such as pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also induced the expression of BB-1 on immunoglobulin (Ig)-positive cells. In contrast, BB-1 could not be detected on normal lymphoid tissues by complement-dependent cytotoxicity and immunofluorescence (IF) assays or by analysis with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). T cell blasts, T cell leukemias, and pre-B cell or erythroblastic leukemia cell lines were also BB-1 negative. Of particular interest was the finding that BB-1 was expressed on the Jijoye lymphoma but only marginally on a subline of Jijoye, P3HR-1, that lacks receptors for EBV and produces a defective virus incapable of transforming lymphocytes. A second lymphoblast antigen (LB-1) unlike BB-1, was present on both T and B cell blasts and virus-transformed T- and B-LCL but not on normal lymphoid tissues.
