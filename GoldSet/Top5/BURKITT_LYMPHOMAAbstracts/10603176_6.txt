Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) episomal DNA is extensively methylated in Burkitt lymphoma derived cell lines. In this study we examined whether lytic viral cycle reactivation is dependent on demethylation of critical viral genes. Viral replication was induced in the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Daudi by the combination of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and sodium-butyrate. Two regions necessary for EBV replication, the BZLF1 immediate early region and the origin of lytic cycle replication (ori Lyt) were demethylated during the early phase of the lytic virus cycle. Demethylation was observed while production of new (unmethylated) viral DNA was blocked by phosphonoformic acid (PFA). This suggests that demethylation, which may be instrumental for the onset of the lytic cycle, is an active process independent of viral DNA replication
