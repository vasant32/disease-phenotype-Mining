Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA isolated from the frequently studied and unusual Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Daudi, contains a 7.4-kb deletion, similar to (but larger than) that found in a non-transforming isolate of the virus, P3HR-1. A comparison of EBV sequence in Daudi cells with that from a comparable region in a wild-type, transforming strain of the virus (B95-8) indicates that at least two of the previously identified RNAs, a highly repetitive sequence, and other interesting coding or structural features should be absent in Daudi EBV DNA as a consequence of the deletion. The information removed by the deletion, as well as that which might be generated by juxtaposition of two regions of the genome that are not adjacent in most strains of the virus are discussed.
