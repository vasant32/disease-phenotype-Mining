Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in an 8-year-old boy with Williams syndrome is reported. Molecular DNA analysis showed a maternal deletion at 7q11.23, the locus of elastin and several other genes, including the BCL7B gene, involved in early development. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of a lymphoma in a Williams syndrome patient and the first in a child.
