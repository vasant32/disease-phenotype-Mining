Cell surface-associated viral glycoproteins are thought to play a major role as target antigens in cellular cytotoxicity and antiviral immunosurveillance. One such glycoprotein is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded glycoprotein 350 (gp350), which is expressed on both virion envelope and EBV producer cells and carries the virus attachment protein moiety. Although it is known that some antibodies to gp350 can neutralize the virus, the role of this glycoprotein in EBV-specific cellular cytotoxicity is not yet clear. We describe here a study in which we successfully used a new approach to demonstrate that gp350 is a target antigen for EBV-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Transfection of gp350-negative cells resistant to natural killer (NK) cell activity (i.e., Raji) with a recombinant vector (pZIP-MA) containing the gene encoding the EBV-gp350 and the neomycin resistance gene enabled us to isolate cell clones with a stable and strong expression of gp350 on their surface membranes. ADCC determined by using two clones clearly demonstrated that gp350 is the target of the EBV ADCC. Interestingly, this ADCC was comparable to that obtained against the EBV-superinfected (coated) Raji cell expressing the same percentage of gp350 positivity as the two clones. No cytotoxic activity was detected against either nontransfected (gp350-negative) Raji cells or cells transfected with the vector [pZIP-neo-SV(X)1] lacking the gp350 gene. In addition to demonstrating that gp350 is a target molecule for EBV-specific ADCC, our approach in using NK-resistant transfectants provides a lead for probing the role of cell surface-associated viral antigens in specific cellular killing and immunosurveillance.
