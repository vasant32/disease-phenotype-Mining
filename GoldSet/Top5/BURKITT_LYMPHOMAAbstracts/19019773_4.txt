Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma with a consistent MYC translocation. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been associated with BL at different frequencies, depending on the clinical variant and geographic regions. This is a large-scale study of BL in Brazil, including 234 patients from 5 geographic regions that are widely disparate socioeconomically, including pediatric (61.1%) and adult (37.6%) populations. EBV was present in 52.6% of all BL cases, varying from 29% (12/42) in the South to 76% (13/17) in the North. Most of the cases were EBV type A. The frequency was higher in the pediatric group, and EBV association within this age range predominated in all regions except the South. Expression of p53 protein was observed in 16.2%, and only rare cases showed p63 expression. BL in Brazil is regionally distinct and has a low incidence of p53 overexpression and a higher-than-expected association with EBV in sporadic cases.
