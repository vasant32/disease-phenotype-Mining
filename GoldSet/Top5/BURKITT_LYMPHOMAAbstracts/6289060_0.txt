EBV-associated polypeptides induced in different Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-producing cell lines by the tumor promotor TPA, and from purified EBV particles derived from the same lines were radioactivity labeled and analyzed by immunoprecipitation with human VCA+MA+ sera. In virus-producing cells no significant differences in the molecular weight of 35S-methionine-labeled EBV-associated polypeptide patterns could be observed. The analysis 125I-labeled polypeptides from purified virus particles of four different strains revealed that, in addition to common polypeptides, individual EBV strains contain strain-specific high molecular weight glycopolypeptides. These polypeptides, constituting part of the membrane antigen complex, are present in varying amounts. While P3HR-1 virus particles contain a major component of 250 000 and small amounts of 340 000 molecular weight polypeptides, Q IMR-WIL virus particles have more 340 00 than 240 000 molecular weight polypeptides. Furthermore, in B95-8 particles and in particles from an EBV strain isolated from an African green monkey (AGM-EBV) respectively, large amounts of 360 000 and 250 000 polypeptides could be observed. Since these glycopolypeptides carry strain-, subgroup- and group-specific antigenic determinants, also found in virus strains produced in human and marmoset cells, it should be further investigated whether these differences in molecular weight are virus-strain- or cell-specific.
