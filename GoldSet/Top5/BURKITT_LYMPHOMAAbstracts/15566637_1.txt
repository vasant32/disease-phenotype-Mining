 BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The BARF(1) (BamHI A right frame1)gene,encoded by Epstein-Barr virus(EBV),may have oncogenic properties,which leaded to immortalization of a monkey kidney epithelial cell line and malignant transformation of human B lymphocytes and murine fibroblasts. This study was designed to evaluate effect of BARF(1) on cell transformation and tumorgenesis on human epithelia and its mechanisms. METHODS: BARF(1) was amplified from B95-8 cell line by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Eukaryotic recombinant vector pcDNA(3)-BARF(1) was constructed,and transfected into human bronchial epithelial cell line HBE,and expression of BARF(1) in the transfected cells was detected by Western blot. Growth status,proliferation rate,ability of colony formation in soft agar,and tumorigenicity of HBE cells transfected with BARF(1) were studied. RESULTS: BARF(1) gene promoted proliferation and transformation of HBE cells. After injected with 1 x 10(7) HBE cells transfected with BARF(1),tumor nodes were observed in 2 of 6 mice at the 10th day. CONCLUSION: BARF(1),as a virus oncogene,may play an important role in malignant transformation of HBE cells.
