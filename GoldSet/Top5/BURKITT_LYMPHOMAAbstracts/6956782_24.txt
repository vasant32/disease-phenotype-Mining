A panel of monoclonal antibodies (BA-1, BA-2 and BA-3) were made against the pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line NALM-6. BA-3 binds to the 100,000 mol. wt common ALL antigen (gp100/CALLA), BA-2 binds to a 24,000 mol, wt (p24) cell surface structure and BA-1 binds to a currently undefined antigen. These antibodies were analysed for their reactivity with 67 human leukemia/lymphoma cell lines. The cell lines studied included T ALL, non-T ALL, surface immunoglobulin+ leukemias/lymphomas, and myeloid/monocytoid leukemias. The results indicate that all three antibodies react primarily (but not exclusively) with malignant cells early in B cell development. This pattern of reactivity was similar to previous results obtained with fresh, non-cultured malignant cells. BA-1, BA-2 and BA-3 are useful tools for analysing the developmental options of normal lymphoid cells and for "cleaning up" leukemia/lymphoma cells in selected cases of autologous bone marrow transplantation.
