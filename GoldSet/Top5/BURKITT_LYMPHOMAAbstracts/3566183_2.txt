This study examines the suitability of the intracranial route of transplantation of human cell lines in nude mice for preclinical testing of cytostatic drugs. Tumours were generated by inoculation of human hematopoietic cell lines. Animals in which intramuscularly or intracranially transplanted human tumours developed were treated with cytostatic drugs. Three different cell line generated tumours (T-ALL L735, Hodgkin cell line L540 and Burkitt Lymphoma Line BJAB) were treated with four different drugs (CY, ADM, VCR, VP16). The data show a good correspondence between the results of treatment of intramuscularly and intracranially transplanted tumours. Thus intracranially transplanted tumour in nude mice are suitable for the testing of cytostatic drugs.
