Two new B-cell lines, BALM-13 and BALM-14, were established from the bone marrow aspirate of a 13-year-old male patient with acute leukemia. These cell lines are unique in their expression of CD antigens. BALM-13 was characterized as belonging to the Burkitt lymphoma group III cell type (CD10-, CD20+, CD23+, D39+, CD77-), and BALM-14 to the Burkitt lymphoma group I cell type (CD10+, CD20+, CD23-, CD39-, CD77+). The expression of immunoglobulin chains of BALM-13 (lambda delta mu) differed from those of BALM-14 (lambda mu). Furthermore, BALM-13 was positive for Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen but BALM-14 was negative. This is a unique pair of cell lines having intraclonal phenotypic heterogeneity.
