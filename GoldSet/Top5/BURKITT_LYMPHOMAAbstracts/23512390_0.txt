Objective: To present the first reported case of metastatic Burkitt's lymphoma with a single central nervous system (CNS) metastasis to the pituitary stalk.Methods: Case presentation, review of literature.Results: Though other malignancies are known to metastasize to the pituitary, and diabetes insipidus is often the presenting symptom, there has not been a previously reported case of Burkitt's lymphoma with a single CNS metastasis to the pituitary.Conclusion: A careful history and endocrine review of systems may aid early identification of pituitary or central nervous system metastases.
