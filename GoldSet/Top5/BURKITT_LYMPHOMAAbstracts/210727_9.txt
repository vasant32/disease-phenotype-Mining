Herpesviruses infections occur commonly following kidney transplantation and immunosuppression, and contribute substantially to morbidity in the transplant recipient. In this prospective study, stomatitis, mononucleosis, hepatitis, or interstitial pneumonia occurred in 24 of 30 patients (80%) as a result of reactivation of latent herpesvirus infections, but the majority of these syndromes were self-limited and the infections were often asymptomatic. Rejection occurred significantly more frequently in CMV-infected patients, but a distinct causal relationship cannot be deduced.
