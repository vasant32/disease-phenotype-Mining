Aggressive primary mediastinal non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) represent a particular entity among intrathoracic neoplasms. Twenty-nine patients with primary mediastinal aggressive NHL diagnosed and treated in the author's institution were studied. According to the Revised European-American Lymphoma (REAL) classification, there were 15 diffuse large B-cell, eight T-lymphoblastic, four anaplastic, one large T-cell and one Burkitt's lymphomas. The study group consisted of 14 females and 15 males, with a mean age of 38 yrs. Symptoms arose from an aggressive anterior mediastinal mass, with a high prevalence of superior vena caval syndrome, pleural, and pericardial effusions. At the time of diagnosis, disease was confined to supradiaphragmatic areas in 24 patients, while subdiaphragmatic nodal or extranodal involvement was also present in five. All patients received a combination of aggressive chemotherapy regimens, mainly according to the French protocols for the treatment of NHL. A chest radiograph response of <50% after the first course of chemotherapy and failure to achieve a complete remission after the first line of chemotherapy were significantly associated with unfavourable prognosis. Overall 5-yr and 9-yr survival rates were 55 and 48%, respectively. Patients properly diagnosed and treated with a combined modality of chemotherapy can experience prolonged survival.
