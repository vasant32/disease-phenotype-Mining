We have investigated the expression of the DNA-repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase in the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Raji. An existing mutant Raji cell line which lacks thymidine kinase activity had previously been shown to be Mex- and to no longer express O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase. We report here that in addition to the methyltransferase and thymidine kinase, a third enzyme with an unrelated function, galactokinase, is also not expressed in Raji cells. The control of thymidine kinase expression is post-transcriptional and it is possible that galactokinase and methyltransferase can share a common post-transcriptional regulation with thymidine kinase.
