Dural sinus thrombosis (DST) has been reported in association with cancer in both adults and children. We describe the seven patients seen with this complication in our centre between 1981 and 1995. Diagnosis was confirmed by either cerebral CT scanning, MRI or angiography. Median age was 13 years (range 8-15). Six patients were boys. Six children were being treated for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and one for neuroblastoma. Presenting symptoms were seizures and transient neurologic deficit, often preceded by headaches. The probable cause of DST was found in two cases. Tumour localisation in the central nervous system (CNS) probably caused DST in one patient who was treated for ki 1 lymphoma. Dehydration in combination with a poor general condition seemed to be the cause of DST in the patient with neuroblastoma. In five children with stage III or IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma (three lymphoblastic lymphoma; two Burkitt's lymphoma), etiology remained unknown. In these children, DST occurred early in the course of therapy. The median interval between start of chemotherapy and onset of symptoms was 19 days (range 8-40). No child had received L-asparaginase. Prognosis was favourable, with symptoms completely disappearing without therapy within 1 to 5 days. The incidence of DST in patients with advanced stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma during induction and consolidation was calculated to be below 3%. We conclude that DST is rarely diagnosed in children with cancer. Occurrence during the initial phase of therapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma is associated with a benign prognosis.
