Fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients during chemotherapeutic treatments and malignant hematologic disease. We present a case of a double fungal infection with disseminated Acremonium strictum (A. strictum) and pulmonary Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) and its rapid clinical course. A 17-year-old boy with prolonged neutropenia developed a disseminated fungal infection during induction chemotherapy of his acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The infection was rapidly lethal despite neutrophil recovery and early antifungal combination therapy with amphotericin B and caspofungin. Since there are only a few reports about invasive Acremonium infections, we present this case with regard to differences in the clinic pathologic features of Aspergillosis and other opportunistic fungal infections due to Fusarium or Acremonium species.
