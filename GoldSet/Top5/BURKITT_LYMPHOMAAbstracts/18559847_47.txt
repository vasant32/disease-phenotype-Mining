Single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) emit heat when they absorb energy from near-infrared (NIR) light. Tissue is relatively transparent to NIR, which suggests that targeting CNTs to tumor cells, followed by noninvasive exposure to NIR light, will ablate tumors within the range of NIR. In this study, we demonstrate the specific binding of antibody-coupled CNTs to tumor cells in vitro, followed by their highly specific ablation with NIR light. Biotinylated polar lipids were used to prepare stable, biocompatible, noncytotoxic CNT dispersions that were then attached to one of two different neutralite avidin-derivatized mAbs directed against either human CD22 or CD25. CD22(+)CD25(-) Daudi cells bound only CNTs coupled to the anti-CD22 mAb; CD22(-)CD25(+) activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells bound only to the CNTs coupled to the anti-CD25 mAb. Most importantly, only the specifically targeted cells were killed after exposure to NIR light.
