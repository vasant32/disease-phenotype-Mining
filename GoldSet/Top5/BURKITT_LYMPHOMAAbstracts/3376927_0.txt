A 61-yr-old man with Burkitt's lymphoma who presented with 6 months of diarrhea was found, at ileoscopy, to have inflammation of the mucosal narrow lumen, deep linear ulcerations, and a "cobblestone" appearance of the terminal ileum. Endoscopic biopsies were diagnostic of Burkitt's lymphoma, and no laparotomy was necessary. Presentation with diarrhea and the age of the patient were unusual, and the endoscopic features and diagnosis of the disease in the terminal ileum made by ileoscopy have not been previously reported.
