Two Epstein-Barr virus latent cycle promoters for nuclear antigen expression, Wp and Cp, are activated sequentially during virus-induced transformation of B cells to B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in vitro. Previously published restriction enzyme studies have indicated hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides in the Wp and Cp regions of the viral genome in established LCLs, whereas these same regions appeared to be hypermethylated in Burkitt's lymphoma cells, where Wp and Cp are inactive. Here, using the more sensitive technique of bisulfite genomic sequencing, we reexamined the situation in established LCLs with the typical pattern of dominant Cp usage; surprisingly, this showed substantial methylation in the 400-bp regulatory region upstream of the Wp start site. This was not an artifact of long-term in vitro passage, since, in cultures of recently infected B cells, we found progressive methylation of Wp (but not Cp) regulatory sequences occurring between 7 and 21 days postinfection, coincident with the period in which dominant nuclear antigen promoter usage switches from Wp to Cp. Furthermore, in the equivalent in vivo situation, i.e., in the circulating B cells of acute infectious mononucleosis patients undergoing primary EBV infection, we again frequently observed selective methylation of Wp but not Cp sequences. An effector role for methylation in Wp silencing was supported by methylation cassette assays of Wp reporter constructs and by bandshift assays, where the binding of two sets of transcription factors important for Wp activation in B cells, BSAP/Pax5 and CREB/ATF proteins, was shown to be blocked by methylation of their binding sites.
