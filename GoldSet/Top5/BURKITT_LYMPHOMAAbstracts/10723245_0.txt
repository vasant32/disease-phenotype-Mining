A 67-year-old man with a 7-month history of dilated cardiomyopathy was admitted to our hospital because of general fatigue, shortness of breath, and anemia on laboratory examination. Increased blasts were observed in the bone marrow. The blasts were characterized by large cells with abundant, intensely basophilic, vacuolated cytoplasm, round nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. Chromosome analysis revealed a nonrandom t(8;22)(q24;q11) chromosomal abnormality, and surface-marker analysis disclosed a positive immunophenotype for CD10, CD19, CD20, CD38, HLA-DR, FMC7, and IgM-lambda. These findings yielded a diagnosis of L3 acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient was treated with chemotherapeutic agents. On the 39th hospital day, during hematologic recovery after induction therapy, abdominal pain developed. Abdominal X-ray films disclosed ileus with dilatation of the small bowel and Kerckring's folds. Conservative treatment was begun but the patient died. At autopsy, intestinal perforations were observed at a site 55 cm proximal to the ileocecal junction. A specimen of perforated tissue revealed a diffuse infiltration of leukemic cells through the small bowel wall. However, bone marrow specimens showed no signs of aggravation of leukemia.
