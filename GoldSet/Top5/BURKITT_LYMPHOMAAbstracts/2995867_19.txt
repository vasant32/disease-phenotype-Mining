Four cases of radiation-associated gliomas are described. All patients were white men, irradiated in childhood for craniopharyngioma, anaplastic ependymoma, retinoblastoma of the orbit, and Burkitt's lymphoma, respectively. The dose ranged from 1800 to 5900 rads, and the latency period was 5 to 25 years. All primary and secondary tumors were verified histologically, and no evidence of persistence of the primary tumors was found. All secondary tumors arose in the fields of irradiation. Ninety-six cases of radiation-induced tumors of the central nervous system have been reported in the literature to date. Twenty-four were gliomas and occurred mainly in young men.
