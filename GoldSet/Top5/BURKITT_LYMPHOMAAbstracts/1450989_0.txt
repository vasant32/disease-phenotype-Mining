The HuIFN-alpha and beta genes were examined by the PCR method in the 11 human lymphoblastoid cell lines. The results showed that the homozygous deletion of HuIFN-alpha and beta genes was detected in 5 of 11 cell lines and in 5 of 11 cell lines, respectively. The deletions of both the HuIFN-alpha and beta genes were observed in 4 of 11 cell lines. One T cell leukemia cell line deleted only HuIFN-alpha gene, while the other T cell leukemia line deleted only HuIFN-beta gene. This suggests that the deletions of HuIFN-alpha and beta genes may be related the development of leukemia or lymphoma.
