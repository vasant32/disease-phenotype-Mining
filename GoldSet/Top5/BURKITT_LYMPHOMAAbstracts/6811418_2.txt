Hybrids obtained by the fusion of PUT, an ouabain and TG-resistant subline of the Burkitt lymphoma(BL)-derived P3HR-1 line, with hemopoietic cells of various differentiation types were tested for their membrane and intracellular immunoglobulin expression. PUT cells carry no membrane immunoglobulin, but contained intracellular 61K mu chain and kappa chain. The PUTKO-1 hybrid, derived from the fusion of PUT with the erythroleukemia line K562 contains no detectable immunoglobulin. NAMPUT, a hybrid between PUT and the IgM-lambda-producing BL line Namalwa, synthetizes cellular mu, lambda and kappa chains, but its surface-Ig is exclusively mu-lambda. Two different mu chains could be detected, both precipitated by either anti-mu or anti-lambda sera. Immunoprecipitation with anti-kappa precipitated neither kappa nor mu. PUTRAL was derived by fusing PUT with Rael, an unusual surface-IgG-lambda-carrying BL line. In this hybrid, the ability to synthesize gamma and lambda chains has been eclipsed, but two mu chains are present: one corresponding to the truncated 61K chain of PUT, and a normal-sized 74K. Between 20 and 30% of the cells stain for surface IgM.
