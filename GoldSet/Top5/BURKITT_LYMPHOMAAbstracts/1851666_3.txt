Epigenetic changes may play a role in genetic alterations in cancer cells, but little is known about this phenomenon. In this study we examined the correlation between rearrangement and methylation status of the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain gene in 23 patients with B precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In B precursor ALL, all patients had a CCmeGG sequence in the C beta 2 region, a pattern similar to that observed in normal mature B-cells. Approximately 55% of patients with B precursor ALL exhibiting a hypomethylated CCGG sequence at the J beta 1 region showed rearrangement of this region. Furthermore, the same allele of rearranged J beta 1 always contained an unmethylated sequence in the region, although another allele without rearrangement contained methylated J beta 1. By contrast, none of the patients had a rearrangement in the J beta 1 region without hypomethylation. Therefore, rearrangement of the J beta 1 region may link to the hypomethylation status of this region. A close association between hypomethylation of the J beta 1 region may promote accessibility to a putative common recombinase to produce TCR J beta 1 rearrangement. In contrast, about 45% of patients with a hypomethylated J beta 1 did not show rearrangement in this region, thus allowing categorization of B precursor ALL patients into subtypes, according to the combination of TCR beta-chain gene rearrangement and hypomethylation status, especially in the J beta 1 region.
