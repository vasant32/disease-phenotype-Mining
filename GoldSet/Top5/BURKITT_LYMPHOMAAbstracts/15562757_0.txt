 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the inhibition mechanisms of BAY11-7082 (IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation inhibitor) and Lactacystein (proteosome inhibitor) in CD154-induced NF-kappaB activation. METHODS: We used recombinant CD154 to stimulate EBV/LMP1 negative Ramos B cell and observed the effects of BAY11-7082 and Lactacystein in CD154-induced NF-kappaB luciferase activation, phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-alpha, phosphorylation of p65, and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB subunits upon CD154 stimulation. RESULTS: Both BAY11-7082 and Lactacystein abrogated CD154-induced NF-kappaB luciferase activation in Ramos cells. While CD154-induced phosphorylation of p65, phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-alpha, and nuclear translocation of p50, p65, and c-Rel were all blocked by BAY11-7082; Lactacystein only inhibited degradation of IkappaB-alpha and p65 nuclear translocation. CONCLUSION: BAY11-7082 and Lactacystein inhibit CD154-induced NF-kappaB activation through different mechanisms.
