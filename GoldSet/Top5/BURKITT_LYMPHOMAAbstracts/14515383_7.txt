 BACKGROUND: This retrospective study was designed to estimate the incidence of primary gastric non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in childhood and the possible association with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). PROCEDURE: We reviewed and analyzed the charts of 135 patients with NHL that were diagnosed and treated in a single oncology unit during the last 20 years. RESULTS: Only two patients, 5 and 12 years old, with primary gastric NHL were found. Upper gastroduodenal endoscopy detected an ulcer in the lesser curvature of the body of the stomach, in both cases. Endoscopy revealed a moderate chronic gastritis in the antrum of both patients that was H. pylori associated in one of them who also suffered from chronic gastritis. Biopsy specimens demonstrated infiltration by Burkitt lymphoma (BL). The two patients received chemotherapy for 6 months. Additionally, one of the two patients received a triple therapy regimen with bismuth, amoxicillin, and metronidazole for H. pylori. Fifteen and six years later they are in complete remission, free of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Primary gastric NHL in childhood is rare. It was found in fewer than 2% of our NHL patients. The temporal relationship between the H. pylori infection and BL suggest a causative link between these two events.
