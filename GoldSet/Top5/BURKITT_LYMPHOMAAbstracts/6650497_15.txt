The restriction fragment length polymorphism D14S1 is delineated by the cloned, single-copy DNA fragment pAW-101. This cloned fragment can therefore serve as a useful marker for gene linkage studies, and the exact location on the gene map is of great interest. pAW-101 was 3H-labeled and hybridized in situ to normal, prometaphase chromosome preparations. Analysis of the grain distribution shows this fragment to be localized to the long arm of chromosome 14 at band q32. Using lymphoid cell lines with 8;14 reciprocal translocations (q24.1;q32.3) from patients with Burkitt lymphoma, we found that the DNA fragment hybridizes to the rearranged chromosome 14 proximal to the breakpoint. These results localize D14S1 to the region 14q32.1 leads to 32.2 This is consistent with localization of this fragment utilizing somatic cell hybrids and family studies.
