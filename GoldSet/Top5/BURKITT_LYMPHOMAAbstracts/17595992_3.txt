BACKGROUND: Burkitt's lymphoma is the most common childhood tumour in subSaharan Africa that typically affects the jaws and abdomen. Ocular involvement with blindness has been documented in some studies. OBJECTIVE: This was to evaluate the role of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) as a cause of blindness in Nigerian children. METHODS: Cases of BL seen in the hospital between 1986 and 2003 were studied retrospectively. Some of the patients with orbital disease at presentation underwent ultrasonographic examination of the eyes. RESULTS: Forty-three (16.5%) of the 260 patients seen presented with orbital tumours; 29 (67.4 %) of the 43 patients had full ophthalmic examination. The patients studied comprised 22 males and 7 females with a M: F ratio of 3:1, and median(age range) of 7(3-15) years. Orbital tumours occurred concurrently with jaw masses on the same side in 19(65.5 %) of 29 patients; the eye diseases were unilateral in 23 (79.3%) and bilateral in six (20.7%) of the cases. Proptosis was the ocular presentation in 27(93%) of patients and it was associated with conjunctival injection in nine, chemosis in 11 and exposure keratopathy in five. Fourteen (48.3%) patients had associated blindness; 12 (85.7%) remained blind in the affected eye(s) and one regained vision to 6/36 after chemotherapy. The patients underwent Cyclophosphamide-Oncovin-Methotrexate (COM) regimen with intrathecal therapy. Eight (27.6%) patients had concomitant CNS disease; these included cases of 6th and 7th nerve palsies, one case of intra-cerebral extension of tumour and another case of total ophthalmoplegia. CONCLUSION: Burkitt's lymphoma is an important cause of childhood blindness in Nigeria and the orbital disease ismainly extra ocular.
