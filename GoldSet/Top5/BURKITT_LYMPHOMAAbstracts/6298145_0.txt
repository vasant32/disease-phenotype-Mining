The possibility of complementation between herpesvirus papio (HVP) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was investigated. Strain 594S-F9 of HVP, unlike strain P3HR-1 of EBV, is not capable of inducing virus antigen synthesis in the EBV genome-carrying, nonproducer lymphoma cell line Raji. The effects of dual infection with these viruses were studied. With untreated viruses, the percentage of cells positive for viral antigens was equal to or slightly less than that in cultures infected with P3HR-1 virus only. However, if UV-irradiated P3HR-1 virus was employed in the dual infection, the relative number of virus antigen-positive cells was enhanced over cultures infected with P3HR-1 virus alone. These results suggest functional complementation between EBV and HVP.
