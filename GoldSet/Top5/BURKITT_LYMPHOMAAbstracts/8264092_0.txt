A retrospective study of Burkitt's lymphoma done over a period of 7 years is presented. The relative frequency of Burkitt's lymphoma as compared to other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas was 6.35%. Although Pakistan is non-endemic for Burkitt's lymphoma, but the frequency of the disease is higher than other non-endemic countries. There was male predominance (M:F 2.3:1). Majority of the cases were in pediatric age group and 12% were older than 35 years. The main clinical presentation was abdominal (42%), either in the intestinal tract (22%) or retroperitoneal (18%) region (American mode of presentation). Jaw tumour (4%) (African mode) was rare. Sporadic cases at almost all sites were also encountered. Burkitt's lymphoma presenting as primary nodal disease was seen in 36% cases. Fifty-four percent showed bone marrow infiltration. The stage of the disease at diagnosis was advance in 54% cases. Follow-up of ten cases revealed poor survival inspite of treatment.
