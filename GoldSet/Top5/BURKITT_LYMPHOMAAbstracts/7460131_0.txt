The authors report on four observations on Burkitt's lymphoma fro Mauritania: three nodes lymphoma and one abdomen tumor. Mauritania climatic conditions are far from climatic conditions suitable to Burkitt's lymphoma development. Classical monochemotherapy (cyclophosphamide or methotrexate) were inefficient. Therefore, the authors suggest to utilise a polychemotherapy including cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, VM 26, and prednisone.
