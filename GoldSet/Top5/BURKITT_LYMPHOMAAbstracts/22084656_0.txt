We report the case of an HIV-infected young men with neuro-toxoplasmosis localized in the spinal cord. The patient received chemotherapy and immunotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma one year before. At the time of the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis, he was on prophylaxis with trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and in complete remission of Burkitt lymphoma. The CD4+ T cell count was 270/Î¼l and the HIV viremia was undetectable. These findings suggest that in this patient, the immunodeficiency promoting the neurologic toxoplasmosis arose more from previous immuno-chemotherapy than from the HIV-infection itself. On the whole, this case highlights that the risk stratification for opportunistic infections of HIV-infected patients should carefully consider their previous medical history and therapies received.
