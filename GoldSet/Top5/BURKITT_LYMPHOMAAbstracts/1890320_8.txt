While B-cell lymphomas are frequently found in AIDS patients, reports on oral manifestations are rare. Among a group of 465 HIV-infected patients 5 presented with primary oral manifestations of a malignant B-cell lymphoma. The primary site of manifestation was the maxilla in 3 cases and the mandible in 2 cases. Based on the histological and immunohistochemical examination the tumors were differentiated as Burkitt's lymphoma (n = 1), as anaplastic large cell (ALC) lymphoma of the B-cell type (n = 1), as high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma not classifiable according to the Kiel classification (n = 1), as immunoblastic-plasmoblastic lymphoma (n = 1), and as centroblastic lymphoma (n = 1). Serum samples were negative for HTLV-I antibodies in 5/5 cases.
