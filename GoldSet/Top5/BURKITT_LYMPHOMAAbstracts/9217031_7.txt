BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with leiomyosarcoma in children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and in organ transplant recipients. To determine whether EBV is associated with leiomyosarcoma in HIV negative patients, the authors examined resected leiomyosarcomas for EBV and HIV. METHODS: Twenty-four leiomyosarcomas were studied and their diagnosis confirmed on pathologic review. From these specimens DNA was isolated. Tumor samples were analyzed for EBV and HIV using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique followed by gel electrophoresis and Southern blot analysis. DNA from an EBV-infected human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line and peripheral blood from an HIV positive patient were used as positive controls for the presence of EBV and HIV, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed using an antibody to Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen. RESULTS: HIV was not present in any of the patients analyzed. EBV DNA was detected in tumor tissue; however, 80 cycles of PCR were used before EBV sequences were detected. Therefore, the data indicate that tumor tissue was not infected with EBV. The positive results observed after 80 cycles of PCR were likely due to infiltrating lymphocytes. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the lack of active or latent EBV infection in tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that EBV is not associated with sporadic leiomyosarcoma in HIV negative patients. Therefore, the biology of leiomyosarcoma associated with HIV may be substantially different from the more common sporadic form.
