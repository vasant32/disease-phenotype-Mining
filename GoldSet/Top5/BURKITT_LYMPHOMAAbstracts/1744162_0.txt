Interaction of active and UV-inactivated vaccinia virus at high multiplicity caused cytological changes and inhibition in cellular protein and DNA synthesis, thus arresting the multiplication of Burkitt-lymphoma-derived Daudi cells and eventually killing the cells. Adsorption to the cells but the lack of penetration was evident by immunofluorescence, electron microscopy and [3H]thymidine-labeled virus incorporation. Viral DNA synthesis or virus replication was not demonstrated. Thus, it appears that the massive adsorption of viral particles, active or UV-inactivated, or possibly a "toxic" component that resides in the virion, damages the plasma membrane and may be responsible for killing the cells by a mechanism of lysis from without.
