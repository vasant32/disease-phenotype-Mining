Primary rectal lymphoma in childhood is rare. We report a case in a 10-year-old boy who presented with rectal bleeding and a single rectal polyp. Histologic examination, immunophenotyping and molecular genetic study of the polyp showed a diffuse B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt-like type. The literature on this topic is reviewed and pathologic examination of childhood rectal polyps is emphasized.
