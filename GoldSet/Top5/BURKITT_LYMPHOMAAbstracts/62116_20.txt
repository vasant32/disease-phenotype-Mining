A new X-linked recessive lymphoproliferative syndrome has variable phenotypes: fatal infectious mononucleosis (I.M.), agammaglobulinaemia after I.M., American Burkitt's lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, immunoblastic sarcoma of B cells, or plasmacytoma. An immunodeficiency to rubeola and the Epstein-Barr virus probably ensues from the mutant gene. The phenotypes (spectrum of B-cell disorders) have a common inheritance and the aetiology is similar.
