A case of histiocytic lymphoma that progressed to a leukemic phase was studied by various methods. Although the cells were found to bear a superficial morphologic resemblance to histiocytes, they more closely resembled transformed lymphocytes. Immunologic markers strongly supported a B-lymphoid origin in this case, while cytogenetic analysis indicated a large number of consistent chromosomal rearrangements, including a translocation involving chromosomes Nos. 8 and 14 which has been previously reported to occur primarily in Burkitt's lymphoma.
