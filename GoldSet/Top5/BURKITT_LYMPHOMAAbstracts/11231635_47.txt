Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus associated with a number of human malignancies including Burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lymphoproliferative disease and, though still debated, breast carcinoma. A subset of latent EBV antigens is required for mediating immortalization of primary B-lymphocytes. Here we demonstrate that the carboxy-terminal region of the essential latent antigen, EBNA-3C, interacts specifically with the human metastatic suppressor protein Nm23-H1. Moreover, EBNA-3C reverses the ability of Nm23-H1 to suppress the migration of Burkitt lymphoma cells and breast carcinoma cells. We propose that EBNA-3C contributes to EBV-associated human cancers by targeting and altering the role of the metastasis suppressor Nm23-H1.
