Fifteen of 16 lymphoma-derived cell lines and the Faji and P3HR1 cell lines were characterized with regard to certain surface markers, particularly immunoglobulins, complement receptors, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) receptors, and Fc receptors. Ten lines positive for EBV nuclear antigen (EB-pos) were stained weakly or not at all by antihuman immunoglobulin fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugates, whereas EBV nuclear antigen negative (EB-neg) cell lines stained brightly. EB-pos lines frequently manifested Fc receptors, particularly for 7S antibody, whereas EB-neg lines did not. Receptors for the C3b component of complement and for EBV, which correlated significantly with each other, were expressed to a much lesser extent by EB-neg lines than by EB-pos lines. These findings are pertinent to an understanding of the infrequent association of this virus with American undifferentiated lymphomas of the Burkitt's and non-Burkitt's types.
