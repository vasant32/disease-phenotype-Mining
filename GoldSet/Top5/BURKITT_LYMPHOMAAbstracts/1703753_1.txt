A 10-year-old schoolboy was referred to the Ophthalmic Unit of Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital because of sudden loss of sight following 5 days of severe frontal headache. The child had bilateral ptosis with internal and external ophthalmoplegia and fixed and dilated pupils. There was no papilloedema. Eight days later, a jaw tumour and a rapidly enlarging abdominal tumour appeared. A fine needle aspiration biopsy of the jaw tumour confirmed Burkitt's lymphoma. Combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and methotrexate (COM) led to a rapid resolution of the jaw and abdominal tumour but the child never regained his sight. Cerebrospinal fluid examination was not helpful in reaching a diagnosis.
