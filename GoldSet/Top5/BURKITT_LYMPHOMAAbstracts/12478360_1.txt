A 10-year-old boy with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome developed disseminated Burkitt lymphoma 2 years after renal transplantation. Treatment consisting of reduction of immunosuppression and polychemotherapy was initiated, and induced complete tumor remission. A severe cerebellar syndrome attributed to high-dose cytarabine occurred during treatment. The patient recovered partially from this complication. Immunosuppression had to be resumed 2 years later because of a chronic rejection. Finally, at last follow-up, the patient was alive with a stable creatinine of 180 micromol/l.
