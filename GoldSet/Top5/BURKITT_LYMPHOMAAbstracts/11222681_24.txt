Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) latency-associated promoters Qp, Cp, and LMP1p are crucial for the regulated expression of the EBNA and LMP transcripts in dependence of the latency type. By transient transfection and in vitro binding analyses, many promoter elements and transcription factors have previously been shown to be involved in the activities of these promoters. However, the latency promoters have only partially been examined at the nucleotide level in vivo. Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of in vivo protein binding and CpG methylation patterns at these promoters in five representative cell lines and correlated the results with the known in vitro binding data and activities of these promoters from previous transfection experiments. Promoter activity inversely correlated with the methylation state of promoters, although Qp was a remarkable exception. Novel protein binding data were obtained for all promoters. For Cp, binding correlated well with promoter activity; for LMP1p and Qp, binding patterns looked similar regardless of promoter activity.
