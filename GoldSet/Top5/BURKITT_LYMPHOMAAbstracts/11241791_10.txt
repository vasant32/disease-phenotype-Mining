We studied a stratified cohort of 51 childhood B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs) to evaluate the efficiency of spectral karyotyping (SKY) in the detection of chromosome aberrations previously diagnosed using chromosome banding and/or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Despite the small number of cases analyzed, several important features emerge from the study: (a) The result of banding analysis was revised in two-thirds of the cases. Eighty-three chromosome anomalies previously undetected or not characterized using chromosome banding were identified by spectral karyotyping, even in patients with apparently normal karyotypes. (b) All hyperdiploidy cases showed one or more extra copies of chromosomes X, 14, and 21. (c) Two hidden rearrangements, a t(7;12)(?p12;p13), and a new translocation, a t(9;12)(q31;p13), both involving the TEL gene, were characterized. (d) Some cryptic rearrangements, such as the der(21) t(12;21) translocation, remained undetected. (e) No new recurrent chromosome anomalies were discovered with this technique. In conclusion, the present study confirms the efficiency of the SKY technique in resolving and characterizing many complex chromosome anomalies seen in childhood B-ALLs, but it raises questions about the ability of this technique to detect cryptic rearrangements, such as the t(12;21) translocation.
