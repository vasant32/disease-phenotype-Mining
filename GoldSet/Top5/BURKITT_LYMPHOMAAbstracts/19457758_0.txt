 PURPOSE: Tumours of the ovary is rare in childhood. The aim of our work was to describe the epidemiology and histological aspects of these tumours in Togo. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of the epidemiologic and pathologic features of the ovary tumours in childhood (0 to 15 years), observed from 1988 to 2007 at the laboratory of pathology of the Tokoin teaching hospital in Lom√©, Togo. RESULTS: During our study period, we observed 32 cases of childhood ovary tumours that represent 8.16% of all ovarian tumours. The average age of occurring was 10.7 years. Histologically it was germ cell tumours in 40.6% of cases (mature teratomas: 34.4% ; immature teratomas: 3.1% ; yolk sac tumours: 3.1%), sex cord-stromal tumours in 21.8% of cases (granulosa cell tumours: 18.7% ; fibroma: 3.1%) and Burkitt lymphoma in 37.6%. CONCLUSION: The childhood ovary tumours although rare, exist in Togo dominated by Burkitt lymphoma.
