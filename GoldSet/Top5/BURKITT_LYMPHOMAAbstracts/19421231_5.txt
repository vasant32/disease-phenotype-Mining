p53 inactivation is often observed in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells, because of either mutations in p53 gene or an overexpression of the p53-negative regulator MDM2. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is present in virtually 100% of BL cases occurring in endemic areas, but in only 10-20% of sporadic cases. In EBV(-) BL cells, reactivation of p53, induced by reducing MDM2 protein level, led to apoptosis. We show here that nutlin-3, a potent antagonist of MDM2, activates the p53 pathway in all BL cell lines harboring wild-type p53, regardless of EBV status. However, nutlin-3 strongly induced apoptosis in EBV(-) or latency I EBV(+) cells, whereas latency III EBV(+) cells were much more resistant. Prior treatment with sublethal doses of nutlin-3 sensitizes EBV(-) or latency I EBV(+) cells to apoptosis induced by etoposide or melphalan, but protects latency III EBV(+) cells. p21(WAF1) which is overexpressed in the latter, is involved in this protective effect, as siRNA-mediated inhibition of p21(WAF1) restores sensitivity to etoposide. Nutlin-3 protects latency III BL cells by inducing a p21(WAF1)-mediated G1 arrest. Most BL patients with wild-type p53 tumors could therefore benefit from treatment with nutlin-3, after a careful determination of the latency pattern of EBV in infected patients.
