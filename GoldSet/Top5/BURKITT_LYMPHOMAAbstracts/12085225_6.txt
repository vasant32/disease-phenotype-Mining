The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transforms B cells in part by inhibiting the cellular apoptotic programme. This is also observed when Burkitt lymphoma cell lines are infected with EBV. Induction of apoptosis is one of the mechanisms by which fludarabine inhibits the growth of cells with low proliferative capacity. This compound can also inhibit several other mechanisms in the cell, including inhibition of the synthesis of factors such as STAT1. To analyse the relationship between EBV status, fludarabine-induced apoptosis, and transcription factors we studied the EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma cell line BL2, its EBV-infected counterpart BL2.B95.8 and the EBV-transformed cell line PRI. The BL2 cell line was found to be very sensitive to fludarabine. The BL2.B95.8 and PRI cells were both resistant but the latter to a lesser extent. In the PRI cells fludarabine activated p53, but not in the BL2.B95.8 cells in which the p53 pathway is inactivated. We observed that this inactivation results in part from the lack of expression of the MDM2 inhibitor p14ARF. Conversely, there was a substantial constitutive activation of STAT1, and not of the other STATs, in the BL2.B95.8 cells and a modest one in the PRI cells. Furthermore, expression of STAT1 was significantly reduced by fludarabine treatment in the PRI cells, but not in the BL2.BL95.8 cells. Finally, the expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 was detected only in the BL2.B95.8 and PRI cells. This protein, known to play a role in cell survival, may therefore be involved in the resistance of the BL2.B95.8 cells to fludarabine.
