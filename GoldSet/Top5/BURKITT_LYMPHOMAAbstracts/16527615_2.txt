Reciprocal translocations involving the MYC locus and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) and light chain (IgK and IgL) loci are characteristic for non-Hodgkin lymphomas, especially Burkitt lymphoma, and have been described in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). We report on a case of B-ALL of L3 morphology with MYC-IGH translocation. Bone marrow metaphases were characterized using conventional cytogenetics and molecular cytogenetic techniques. G-banding showed a hyperdiploid complex rearranged male karyotype with 51 chromosomes. Additionally to other chromosome changes, a three-break rearrangement involving 6p21, 8q24, and 14q32, as well as cryptic translocations of IGH locus to MYC locus were detected. To our knowledge, this is the first case with colocalizations of MYC and IGH in a three-break rearrangement involving 6p21 and on an additional derivative chromosome as results of cryptic translocations.
