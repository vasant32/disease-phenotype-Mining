Burkitt's lymphoma can occur from elsewhere in the body, but involvement of the breasts is very rare. A few articles reported bilateral, diffusely infiltrative mammographic, and ultrasonographic features. However, we experienced the involvement of bilateral whole breasts in a patient with underlying Burkitt's lymphoma, which showed negative mammographic and ultrasonographic findings, but bilateral hot uptakes of the breast in FDG-PET scan.
