Specificity of TdT5 as a marker for ALL was evaluated by determining its activity in cells from normal control subjects and from 35 pediatric patients with ALL, AML, Hodgkin's disease and disseminated Burkitt's lymphoma. We evaluated the DNA polymerase activity, cell surface phenotypes (E rosettes, EAC rosettes, Smlg and la-like, HTLA and cALL antigens), and hematological and cytochemical characteristics in both the normal and patient groups. DNA polymerase alpha + beta and DNA polymerase gamma activity were indiscriminately high in all immature cells as found in ALL, AML, Burkitt's lymphoma and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal lymphocytes, when compared to mature leukocytes found in normal individuals or in patients whose cancer was in remission. High TdT activity was found in 24 of 26 T and non-T/non-B ALL patients in active phase as well as in two of three AML patients one of whom had Auer rods. Thus, TdT, although valuable for monitoring ALL patients, may have limitations in separating AML from ALL.
