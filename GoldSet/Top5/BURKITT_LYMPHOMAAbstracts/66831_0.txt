A serum against human lymphoblastic leukemia cells was obtained inoculating rabbits. We studied the specificity of the serum before and after particular absorptions in various clinical conditions. The serum was cytotoxic against many cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, against continuously cultured Burkitt's lymphoma cells and against chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. On the contrary, the serum was not cytotoxic against lymphocytes of normal donors, acute lymphoblastic leukemia in remission and other lymphoproliferative disorders.
