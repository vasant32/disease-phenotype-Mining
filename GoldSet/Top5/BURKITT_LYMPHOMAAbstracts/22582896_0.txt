Anti-lymphoma therapy continues to present a major challenge. Even though cytotoxic therapy, immunotherapy and molecularly targeted therapy have been used in the clinic to treat the disease, effective anti-lymphoma drugs are still needed. In this study, we explored novel anti-lymphoma agents and found that scutellarin, an active component of a traditional Chinese medicinal herb Erigeron breviscapus, executed an anti-lymphoma effect. Scutellarin diminished the proliferation of B-lymphoma Namalwa cells in vitro and inhibited lymphoma growth in Namalwa cell-xenotransplanted mice without obvious toxicity. A mechanism study showed that scutellarin at doses of less than 10 μM induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 transition without the induction of cell apoptosis, which was accompanied by down-regulation of cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression. In contrast, scutellarin at concentrations of 15 μM or above promoted Namalwa cell apoptosis, which was partially associated with the activation of caspases. These results suggest that scutellarin is a new potential anti-lymphoma candidate.
