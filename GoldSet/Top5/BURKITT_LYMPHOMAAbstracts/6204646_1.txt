A protein kinase activity (PK) was associated with immunoprecipitates between polypeptides of human lymphoblastoid cells of malignant origin (Raji cell line) or of their normal counterparts ( Priess cell line) and antibodies directed against avian pp60 src or against the carboxyterminal hexapeptide of pp60 src. Therefore, these human cells and Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) transformed avian cells share antigenic determinants of pp60 src and, in particular, its carboxyterminal sequence, as well as one of its functions, a protein kinase activity. The protein kinase from Raji cells phosphorylated predominantly tyrosine residues, that from Priess cells threonine residues.
