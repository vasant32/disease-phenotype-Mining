Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) has been widely investigated and has attracted attention because of the possible etiologic role of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). To further determine the role of EBV in the causation of this tumor, we measured EBV-specific nuclear antigen (EBNA) and EBV DNA using immunofluorescence and nucleic acid hybridization techniques, respectively. Of 34 BL biopsies, 27 tissues (79%) were EBNA-positive, whereas none of the 25 non-BL biopsy tissues were EBNA-positive. Of 15 BL tumors tested, 14 (93%) were EBV DNA-positive with a mean of 39 (range, 8-86) EBV genome equivalents per cell. Each of the 15 non-BL biopsy specimens subjected to nucleic acid hybridization had less than two virus genome equivalents per cell, although all had serologic evidence of past EBV infection. The findings further supported the possible etiologic role of EBV in African BL and negated the passenger hypothesis. The EBV genome could, therefore, be used as a separating marker between African BL and non-BL lymphomas.
