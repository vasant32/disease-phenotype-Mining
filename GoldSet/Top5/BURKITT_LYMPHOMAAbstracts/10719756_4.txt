The association between Helicobacter pylori infection and low grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma is now widely accepted. In this report, we describe the concurrent development of Burkitt's lymphoma in the stomach of a 53-year-old male with perforated duodenal ulcer and positive H. pylori serology. The temporal relationship between these two events raises the possibility of a causal link between H. pylori infection and this lymphoproliferative disease. In describing this rare case of gastric Burkitt's lymphoma, we consider the evidence that supports this possibility.
