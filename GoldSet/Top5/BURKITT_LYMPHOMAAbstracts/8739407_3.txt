We report seven cases of spinal cord compression resulting from Burkitt lymphoma in boys aged 15 years and below. This became manifest clinically as acute or rapidly progressive spinal cord compression. All the patients showed total paraplegia with a sensory loss at thoracic level and sphincter disturbances. Four patients were operated on, the operation permitting exeresis of an epidural tumor. In three cases surgery was followed by chemotherapy. One patient was treated exclusively with chemotherapy. Owing to the effectiveness of chemotherapy, surgery should be considered only in cases of rapid deterioration or for diagnostic purposes.
