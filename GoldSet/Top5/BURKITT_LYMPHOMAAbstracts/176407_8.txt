Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA (17.7 genome equivalents/cell) was found in tumor tissue from an American patient with Burkitt's lymphoma who had never traveled outside the United States. A lymphoid cell line (NAB) containing the EBV genome was established from tumor tissue from this patient; characteristics of this cell line were described. Previous Burkitt's tumors found in Americans and examined by molecular hybridization were negative for EBV DNA. Our results suggested that EBV is associated with at least some American Burkitt's tumors.
