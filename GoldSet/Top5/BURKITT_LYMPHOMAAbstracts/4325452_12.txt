Seven cases of Burkitt's lymphoma have to date (March 1971) been diagnosed in the county of Bwamba in Uganda. All these patients had the clinical onset of their tumour in the 27 months from October 1966 to December 1968; five of them in the last six months of this period. Two of the patients were full sibs living in the same house. This is the most discrete time-space cluster of the disease yet recorded and provides further evidence for a role in the aetiology of Burkitt's lymphoma of an infective agent with a relatively short latent period.
