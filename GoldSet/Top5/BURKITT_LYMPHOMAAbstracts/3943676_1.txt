CT scans of Burkitt's lymphoma in 8 American patients are presented. Computed tomography was the major diagnostic imaging modality in 4, and the abdomen was the most commonly involved site in our patients. CT was found to be the method of choice for diagnostic purposes and for assessing the size of abdominal masses. Furthermore, because of the relative effectiveness of modern chemotherapeutic agents in treatment of this type of lymphoma, CT did and can play a unique role in follow-up of these cases during therapy.
