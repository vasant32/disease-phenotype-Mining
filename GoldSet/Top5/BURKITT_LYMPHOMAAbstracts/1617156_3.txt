An approach to obtain monoclonal antibodies directed against cell surface proteins induced by interferon has been developed in order to characterize such proteins and determine their role. Hybridomas obtained by fusion of murine myeloma cells and spleen cells of mice immunized with interferon-alpha-treated Daudi cells were screened for the production of antibodies reacting differentially with interferon-alpha-treated and untreated Daudi cells. One such hybridoma, 2D5, produced an antibody reacting with a 28/32 kDa homodimeric protein (p28/32) expressed at the surface of Daudi cells in response to IFN-alpha treatment. IFN-alpha treatment also increased the basal level of p28/32 detected on peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). 2D5 Antibody was used to probe the expression of p28/32 on different cells and in response to various inducers. It appears that 2D5 reacted in fact with CD69, a marker of leukocyte activation and that, following IFN-alpha treatment, CD69 was not induced on all cultured cell lines tested. Interestingly, IFN-gamma was also able to induce CD69 expression on a restricted number of cell lines but the induction pattern only partially overlapped that of IFN-alpha. As expected, activation of cells with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) resulted in a notable increase in the level of CD69 on all cell lines considered except for the epithelial and fibroblastic types.
