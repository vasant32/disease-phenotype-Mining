The spontaneous proliferation and the effects of 8 various growth factors (GF) were evaluated on leukemic cells from 27 patients with B-lineage ALL. Two groups of ALLs were distinguished. ALLs from group I (21 patients) exhibited a low spontaneous proliferative rate and were stimulated by IL-3 + IL-7 +/- SCF and/or LIF, while ALLs from group II (6 patients) had a high spontaneous proliferative rate and did no longer require this combination of GFs for proliferation. No effect of bFGF, IGF-I, IL-10 and IL-11 alone or in combination, was observed. Such differences in the behaviour of B-ALLs indicated that the GF requirement of ALL blasts was not related to the presence of serum in the culture nor to the pattern of reactivity of ALL blasts for B lymphoid markers or CD34 antigen. Furthermore, we showed in 1/9 cases that high proliferation might be due to an overexpression of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene and to the acquisition of an autocrine secretion.
