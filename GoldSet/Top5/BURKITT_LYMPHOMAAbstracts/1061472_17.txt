One hundred twenty-six fluids from 98 patients with malignant lymphomas have been examined cytologically. The overall accuracy was 88 per cent with only one false positive in 126 fluids. False negatives were highest in the cerebrospinal fluid, which may reflect poor exfoliation of malignant lymphoma cells when the leptomeninges are involved. We have found exfoliative cytology to be an accurate method of diagnosing lymphomatous involvement of the leptomeninges, pleura and peritoneum and when a cytologic diagnosis of involvement by lymphoma is made it is almost as accurate as a histologic diagnosis. Nuclear characteristics and selected histochemical methods will allow classification of many types of lymphoma in bytologic preparations.
