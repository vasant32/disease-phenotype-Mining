Six established Japanese Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cell lines including one case with null cell type were studied by chromosomal banding techniques. The modal chromosome number was diploid or nearly diploid in five cases and hyperdiploid in one case. The marker chromosome 14q+ was observed in four of the six cases; the origin of the extra band was a chromosome 8 in three including the null cell case but could not be identified in the other. The two cases lacking the 14q+ marker had variant translocations involving the long arm of chromosome 8, one of which carried a translocation, t(8;22) (q24;q13) and the other a translocation, t(2;8) (p12;q24). Although structural and/or numerical aberrations were found in all six cell lines, chromosome 8 was the one most consistently involved. This frequent involvement of chromosome 8 in aberrations; therefore, may be an important event in the development of BL rather than the presence of a 14q+ marker chromosome.
