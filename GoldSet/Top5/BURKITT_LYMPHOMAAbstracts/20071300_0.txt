We report the results of the protocol CMA (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, Aracytine) reinforced of 26 patients affected by Burkitt lymphoma in facial-maxillary localisation, in a retrospective study from January 2000 till December 2007 and prospective from January till September 2008. Their average age was 7.89 years, with a sex ratio of 2.71. The global response to the treatment was 92.3% with 57.7% of complete remission and 34.6% of incomplete remission. The morbidity related to treatment was essentially a haematological complication (84.6%) and hydroelectrolytic complication (84.6%). Evolution was made towards death in 30.8 and 15.4% were lost of view. The median monitoring was 18.2 months. Treatment response was linked to the therapeutic compliance (P < 0.001), and the delay of consultation (P = 0.01).
