This study evaluates residual disease in 28 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients who obtained a clinicohematologic remission after intensive chemotherapy. Sixteen of 28 patients (57%) showed a normal number of circulating B-lymphocytes, as demonstrated by the low percentage of mouse rosette-forming cells (M-RFC), surface immunoglobulins (SIg), and CD24-positive cells. Clinically, a lower number of relapses occurred in this group of patients compared to those with a persistent expansion of peripheral B-cells (P less than 0.05). In order to assess monoclonality of the residual peripheral B-cell population, the distribution of SIg light chains was investigated on the B-cell-enriched fraction of 15 of these 16 cases. Only six of them had a kappa/lambda ratio which ranged between 1.7:1 and 3:1, whereas the remaining patients still displayed a clearly imbalanced kappa/lambda Ig light chain distribution. On the other hand, the analysis of the configuration of the Ig heavy chain gene region, performed in nine cases (including five of the above six cases), showed the persistence of a rearranged pattern in all cases tested but one. Therefore, residual monoclonal B-cells were found also in the majority of cases which displayed the lowest kappa/lambda ratio, a normal bone marrow lymphocytosis and a long-lasting clinical remission. Studies at the DNA level confirm that a remission is rarely achieved in this disease in spite of intensive and prolonged chemotherapy. Nonetheless, the follow-up of B-CLL patients by conventional immunologic markers may be helpful to better define response to therapy and to predict the occurrence of clinical relapse.
