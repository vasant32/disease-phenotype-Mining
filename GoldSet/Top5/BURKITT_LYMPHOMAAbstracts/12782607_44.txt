The EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is an integral membrane protein that acts like a constitutively activated receptor. LMP1 interacts with members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor family, as well as with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated death domain, resulting in induction of nuclear factor-kappaB, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase activator protein 1-signaling cascade. The binding of Janus kinase 3 results in activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription. The domain structure of LMP1 has been mapped extensively, but the quantitative contribution of distinct LMP1 domains to the efficiency of B-cell proliferation by EBV has not been determined. On the basis of the maxi-EBV system, which allows us to introduce and study mutations in the context of the complete EBV genome, a panel of 10 EBV mutants with alterations in the LMP1 gene locus was established. The mutant EBVs were tested for their efficiency to induce and maintain proliferation of clonal B-cell lines in vitro. Surprisingly and with reduced frequency, EBV mutants which deleted LMP1's COOH terminus, transmembrane domains, or the entire open reading frame were able to generate proliferating B-cell clones that were dependent on the presence of human fibroblast feeder cells. A B-cell clone carrying the LMP1-null mutant EBV genome was also analyzed for oncogenicity in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Our results demonstrate that LMP1 is critical but not mandatory for the generation of proliferating B cells in vitro. LMP1 functions greatly contribute to EBV's transformation potential and appear essential for its oncogenicity in severe combined immunodeficiency mice.
