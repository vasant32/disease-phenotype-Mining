The receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) are two closely related integral membrane glycoproteins involved in signalling of cell growth and metabolism. We have used the unique paradigm of pairs of Burkitt lymphoma cell lines (BLO2, BL30, BL41) with or without Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection and cells transfected with EBV-related genes to examine effects of EBV on expression of these receptors at the gene and protein functional level. In BL30 and BL41 cells, EBV infection increased surface insulin binding and total receptor number by 2- and 18-fold, respectively. By contrast, EBV infection decreased total IGF-I receptors by 29 to 87% in all three cell lines. In general, there was a correlation between total receptor concentration and the level of insulin or IGF-I receptor mRNAs, although in one cell line insulin binding increased while receptor mRNA levels decreased slightly, suggesting posttranslational effects. BL41 cells transfected with a vector expressing the EBV latent membrane protein (LMP) exhibited a 2.6- to 3.2-fold increase in insulin receptor expression, whereas cells transfected with EBNA-2 (one of the EBV nuclear antigens) alone exhibited no effect. However, EBNA-2 appears to be required for the EBV effect on insulin receptor expression since cells infected with a mutant virus, P3JHRI, which lacks the EBNA-2 gene failed to show an increase in insulin receptor number. These data indicate that EBV infection of lymphocytes increases expression of insulin receptors while simultaneously decreasing expression of IGF-I receptors. The magnitude and sometimes even the direction of change, depends on host cell factors. A maximal increase in insulin receptors appears to require the coordinate action of several of the EBV proteins including LMP and EBNA-2.
