Human B-cell lines derived from normal donors (LCL) or from Burkitt lymphomas (BL) were compared for their sensitivity to natural (NK) and interferon (IFN)-activated (IAK) cytotoxicity, mediated by effector cells from normal human blood. In four cases, a BL and an LCL line were derived from the same donor and had been kept in culture for the same period of time. The BL series included both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-carrying and EBV-negative lymphoma lines. The latter were compared with their own EBV-converted, Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA)- and EBV-DNA-positive sublines, established by in vitro infection with two different viral substrains. LCL and BL lines from the same donor were lysed with equal efficiency by both NK and IAK effectors. There was no relationship between the NK sensitivity and the nude mouse tumorigenicity of different EBV-converted Ramos sublines, or the expression of differentiation markers such as insulin receptor, surface IgD, and the B2 surface antigen. Moreover, EBV-converted sublines of BJAB differed in their NK sensitivity, in spite of closely similar expression of these markers. NK-sensitive Ramos and BJAB sublines induced a stronger proliferative response upon confrontation with allogeneic lymphocytes than their NK-resistant counterparts. This suggests that the target cell may play an active role in triggering the lytic interaction. There was no correlation between this property and any of the other parameters studied.
