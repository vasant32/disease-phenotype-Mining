New N-substituted hydrazine linkers were synthesized and their hydrazone derivatives of adriamycin were prepared. These functionalized adriamycin derivatives were conjugated with a monoclonal antibody, 5E9. The release rate of adriamycin from the hydrazones and from some of the conjugates was studied, and their relationship to the IC50's of the conjugate against 5E9-positive Daudi cells was investigated.
