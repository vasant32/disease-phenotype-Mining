Lymphoma in dogs resembles human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in pathological presentation, immunophenotype, and response to therapy, thus representing a good model for comparative studies with human disease. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were derived from mice immunized with a dog lymphoma cell line. Three MAbs were selected for further application in immunophenotyping and immunotherapy. The binding specificities, antigen characterization, and isotypes for these MAbs are described.
