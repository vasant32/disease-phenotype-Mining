Bloom's syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by intrauterine growth retardation, typical physical signs, immunodeficiency and an increased risk of developing neoplasms at a young age, compared to the general population. Factors possibly involved in the pathogenesis of non-endemic Burkitt's lymphoma in a five year old girl with Bloom's syndrome are discussed. These include immunodeficiency, upregulated c-myc expression and an Epstein-Barr viral infection.
