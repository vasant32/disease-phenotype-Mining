The epidemiology of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) has never been documented in Cameroon. Data were collected from 16 hospitals, the Delegation of Public Health and the regional pathologist in the Northwest province of Cameroon on all BL cases. The incidence of BL in this region is 5.9/100,000 children aged <15 years/year - the second highest incidence documented to date. Significant clustering was also identified in Ndop, a low-lying region with a high malaria endemicity, at 21.5 cases/100,000 children aged <15 year/year (P < 0.001).
