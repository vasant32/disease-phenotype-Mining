The designation Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) has proved to be of great convenience but has left undetermined the histogenesis of the tumour and its relationship to other B-cell lymphomas. One definition proposed for BL has been based on its relationship to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The EBV negativity of some BLs and the association of EBV with other non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, however, makes this definition unsatisfactory. Cytogenetic changes involving the translocations of part of chromosome 8 also are not specific for BL. In the Kiel classification, BL appears as a lymphoblastic lymphoma. However, lymphoblastic lymphomas and leukaemias arise from pre-B and early T cells, whereas BL shows characteristics of a more mature B cell. Mann et al. (1976) considered BL to be related to follicle centre-cell lymphomas. The morphology and immunological phenotype of BL are consistent with this hypothesis, although it would appear that BL is more restricted in its capabilities of further differentiation than other follicle centre-cell lymphomas. This lack of differentiation may be related to EBV infection. The characteristic anatomical distribution of BL is quite unlike that of most follicle centre-cell lymphomas and should be considered in the search for its histogenesis. BL involves the jaws during the period of maximum dental development, and also the salivary glands, thyroid, abdominal viscera and abdominal lymph nodes. Massive involvement of the breasts during pregnancy and lactation is characteristic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
