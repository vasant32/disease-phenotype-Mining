 BACKGROUND: Geographic pathology is an accepted basis for unravelling trends of disease patterns. Proper documentation at the initial stage assists in establishing a foundation data. The authors are not aware of a documented pattern of malignant neoplasm in Ekiti State. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to update the available literature on malignant neoplasms and compare our findings with previous work done by other investigators. METHODS: The estimates are based on a systematic retrospective survey of cancer cases identified in the Pathology Laboratories of Federal Medical Centre, Ido-Ekiti and University Teaching Hospital, Ado-Ekiti for the period; January 2002 to December 2009. The data recorded on each case were: source of information (histology or cytology), name, age, and sex, date of diagnosis and site of tumour. Tumour site and histology were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, ICD-10 for presentation in tabular form. RESULTS: A total of 498 cancers were recorded. There were 177 (35.5%) males with average age of 54.5 years and 321 (64.5%) females with average age of 48.6 years. The estimated Crude Incidence (CI) rates for all cancer sites are 14.7 for males and 27.4 for females, per 100,000 population. In males, the most frequent cancer is prostate cancer (37.9%) followed by cancer of the liver (10.7%) and NonHodgkin's Lymphoma, NHL (7.9%). In females, the most common cancer is that of the breast (49.3%) followed by the cervix (8.5%) and the ovary (5.32%). A total of 28 childhood cancers were registered (17 males, 11 females). The most frequent tumours were Burkitt's lymphoma (8 cases) and soft tissue sarcomas (3 cases). CONCLUSION: This study shows that malignant neoplasms are not uncommon in Ekiti State. There is underreporting of cases as the crude incidence rates are low. This study will serve as baseline to more population-based studies in future.
