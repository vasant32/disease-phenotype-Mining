OBJECTIVE: To observe the frequency of histological subtypes of childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and its immunohistochemical profile. SETTING: All cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed in children (< 15 years) in the section of histopathology at the Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi during the period of three years. METHODS: These consecutive cases were evaluated on H&E stained sections and then immunohistochemistry analysis of these tumors was performed by employing Peroxidase Anti-Peroxidase (PAP) technique. RESULTS: The present series included 61 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. NHL was more common in males as compared to females with male to female ratio of 5.8:1. High grade NHL comprised 87% of childhood lymphoma. The mode of presentation in majority of NHL (57%) was extranodal. Burkitt's lymphoma (33%) was the most prevalent histological subtypes, followed by lymphoblastic (28%), diffuse large cell (15%), diffuse mix small and large cell (13%), small non cleaved Non-Burkitt's (7%) and immunoblastic (4%). Immunophenotypic analysis of the childhood Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma revealed that 67% of the Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are B-cell type while 33%, are those of T-cell lineage. CONCLUSION: NHL was more common in males. Majority of NHL in children were high grade tumors. Burkitt's lymphoma was the most frequent histological subtype. T-cell NHL comprised a significant portion of childhood lymphomas.
