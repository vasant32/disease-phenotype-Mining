A 9-year-old girl presented with a choroidal tumor 6 years after remission of Burkitt lymphoma with no evidence of systemic recurrence. The tumor regressed after plaque radiotherapy. The second tumor could have been related to previous chemotherapy, caused by Epstein-Barr virus infection, or the result of independent lymphoma cell growth.
