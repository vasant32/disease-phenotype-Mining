The objectives were to provide estimates of the prevalence of autoantibody (Ab) directed to CD45 in lupus patients, identify the target autoantigen(s), and determine the ability of such reactivity to mediate neutralization of T lymphocytes. Sera from 64 patients were studied using 2 assays: Western blot and an ELISA with CD45 eluted from 3 cell lines as antigen (U937, Jurkat and Daudi). The role of carbohydrate specificity was investigated using enzyme digestion of blotted glycans, competition with sugars, and inhibition with lectins. Apoptosis was studied through annexin V binding, and cell cycle analysis using the propidium iodide method. AutoAb to CD45 were detected in 16/64 sera (25%) by Western blot, and 21/32 sera (66%) found positive in the ELISA. CD45 purified from Daudi cells was identified in the ELISA, but not in the blot. AutoAb were of the IgM and the IgG isotypes, but not specific for a particular cell type or CD45 isoform: 2 dominant specificities were recognized, one against p180, and another against high MW isoforms. Neuraminidase-induced enhancement of reactivity, together with the inhibitory effect of N-acetyl galactosamine and Dolichos diflorus lectin suggest that the epitopes are carbohydrates. AutoAb which were specific for activated CD4+T cells triggered the annexin V binding, and, in 2 of 4 cases, lymphocytes underwent apoptosis. In conclusion, carbohydrate conformational epitopes may be important as target antigens, and some CD45 autoAb have the capacity to neutralize activated T cells through anergy or apoptosis.
