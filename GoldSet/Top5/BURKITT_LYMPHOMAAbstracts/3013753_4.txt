We have screened a human genomic DNA library with an immunoglobulin (Ig) derived switch (S) region specific probe for homologous sequences. Five Ig independent phage clones were isolated and characterized. The S sequence homologous DNA fragments are short compared to the S region sequences. Ig independent S sequences are flanked by highly repetitive DNA elements and perfect inverted repeats can be demonstrated in their close vicinity. Using subclones of S homologous sequences restriction fragment length polymorphisms were shown within DNA of different T cell leukemias, Burkitt lymphomas, lymphoblastoid cell lines, and DNA of healthy individuals. One of the five clones isolated with the S region probe was evidently localized to chromosome 2 and/or 10 and showed a complex hybridisation pattern with several different human DNAs. S homologous sequences of another clone are most likely localized on chromosome 1. It is possible that these Ig independent S sequences have arisen by amplification and transposition and that they are involved in genetic recombination.
