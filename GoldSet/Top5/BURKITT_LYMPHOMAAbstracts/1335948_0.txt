A human Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive lymphoblastoid B cell line, named BA-D10-4, produces a factor of a molecular mass less than 10 kDa that promotes cell proliferation of both BA-D10-4 cells and other human T or B lymphoid cell lines, either EBV-positive or -negative. The factor synergizes with higher molecular mass autocrine growth factors and makes both BA-D10-4 cells and B cell lines from Burkitt's lymphoma, but not cells from T cell leukemia, more responsive to interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Therefore, this low molecular mass factor seems to be an autocrine growth factor per se and to have the characteristics of a competence factor.
