We constructed a series of MAb heterodimers consisting of the J5 (anti-common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen [CALLA]) antibody and antibodies to a variety of structures present on the surface of activated human T cells, including CD3 antigen (T cell receptor-associated glycoproteins), CD2 antigen (T11/E-rosette receptor), CD25 antigen (IL-2 receptor), and the transferrin receptor. We tested the ability of these heterodimers to direct a CD2 + CD3 + CD8 + CD4 - CD25 + transferrin receptor + MHC-restricted human cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone to lyse a CALLA + human tumor in vitro. Only heterodimers containing an anti-CD3 antibody or activating antibodies to CD2 could direct the clone to lyse these human tumor targets, even when the clone was additionally activated with anti-CD3 or anti-CD2 antibodies. Our findings may have implications in the design of strategies for the use of such reagents in the treatment of human neoplasia.
