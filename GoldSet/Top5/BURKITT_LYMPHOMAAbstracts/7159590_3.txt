Deoxyribonuclease activities were examined in isoelectric focusing fractions of non-histone, chromatin-associated and nucleoplasmic proteins of isolated normal human lymphoblastoid and mouse melanoma cell nuclei using parallel procedures. A very similar series of eight DNA endonucleases, each active on calf thymus DNA and containing no exonuclease activity, were found in the chromatin proteins of both cell lines. Several differences were observed: an activity in human cells at pI 6.6 was absent from murine cells, and there was an increased activity in mouse cells at pI 4.4 and a decreased activity at pI 7.3, as compared with corresponding human cell activities. Assay of these fractions against supercoiled, circular phage PM2 DNA showed greater activity among the fractions with acidic pI valves and slightly lower activities in the murine cells than in the human cells. Analysis of the nucleoplasmic fractions showed a series of DNA endonuclease and exonuclease activities which were again very similar between the two cell lines, although greater endonuclease activity at pI 4.4 occurred in mouse than in human nucleoplasm. These results demonstrate an entire series of deoxyribonuclease activities in both chromatin and nucleoplasm which are nearly identical in two very different mammalian cell lines, suggesting that many of these enzymes are ubiquitous in mammalian cell nuclei.
