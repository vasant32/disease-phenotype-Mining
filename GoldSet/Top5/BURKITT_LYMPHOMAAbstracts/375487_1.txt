Data are presented to support a relationship between malaria infection and Burkitt's lymphoma in African children. IgG, IgM and IgA levels were measured in sera from Burkitt's lymphoma patients and from sex- and age-matched, nearest-neighbour controls. All three classes of immunoglobulins were present in significantly lower amounts in the sera from Burkitt's lymphoma patients than in the sera from controls. The mechanism of this apparent B-cell suppression is not yet clear. Malaria-specific IgG and IgM antibody titres were determined in the indirect immunofluorescence test. No significant difference in the IgG malaria-specific antibodies was detected between the two groups of sera. Malaria antibody levels measured using IgM specific conjugates were significantly lower in the sera from Burkitt's lymphoma patients in reactions with Plasmodium falciparum antigen. No significant difference was observed when P. malariae was used. Confirmation of this finding would serve as a positive link between Burkitt's lymphoma and P. falciparum infection.
