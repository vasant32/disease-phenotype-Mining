BACKGROUND: Incidence reports for pediatric lymphoma and lymphoid leukemia in Hispanic subpopulations in the United States are rare. The authors hypothesized that Florida's Hispanic children would have higher risks of lymphoma and lymphoid leukemia compared with non-Hispanic white children. METHODS: All cases of lymphoid leukemia, Hodgkin, non-Hodgkin, and Burkitt lymphoma (SEER International Classification of Diseases for Oncology codes) in children (< 15 years) in the Florida Cancer Data System (FCDS) from 1985 to 1997 were studied. Cases were classified as: 1) white, 2) Hispanic, or 3) black, and stratified by age. Age-adjusted rates for the three race-ethnic groups were calculated. Rates for Hispanics and blacks were compared with whites as standardized rate ratios (SRR) with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty-one incident cases of pediatric lymphoma and 1231 cases of lymphoid leukemia were identified during the study period. For children with lymphoma, the SRR for Hispanics was 1.32 (95% CI, 1.20-1.44), and for blacks, the SRR was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.63-0.72. For lymphoid leukemia, the SRR for Hispanics was 1.29 (95% CI, 1.28-1.30), and for blacks, the SRR was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.54-0.56). Similar rates were found for the Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Incidences of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were significantly higher in Florida's Hispanic children, with 30% increased relative risks, compared with whites. Black children had significantly decreased incidences and risk. Results for lymphoid leukemia were similar. Incidence of lymphoma in Florida's Hispanic children (primarily Cuban and Central American origin) differed from similar reports from Texas and California, where Hispanics are primarily of Mexican origin.
