Spontaneously arising immunocytomas in Lou/Wsl rats contain a consistent translocation between chromosomes 6 and 7. The c-myc gene has been localized to chromosome 7 and has been shown to be rearranged in the majority of the rat immunocytomas. We now report the cloning of the rearranged 11-kilobase EcoRI c-myc fragment from the IgE-secreting IR75 tumor. Sequence analysis revealed that the cytogenetically visible t(6;7) translocation must have involved several events in this tumor. One event has led to the juxtaposition of c-myc and the switch mu region, in a head-to-head orientation. The breakpoint is approximately 850 base pairs upstream from the proximal c-myc promoter on chromosome 7. This area is distinct from the more common mouse plasmacytoma- and Burkitt lymphoma-associated translocation breakpoints and also differs from the known murine retroviral insertion sites. A second rearrangement has led to the transposition of sequences upstream from the switch gamma 1 region to the c-myc-distant end of the switch mu region, tail-to-tail. This requires at least two events, including one inversion. In addition to showing that identical loci (c-myc, immunoglobulin) are juxtaposed via chromosomal translocations in three different tumors (Burkitt lymphoma, mouse plasmacytoma, and rat immunocytoma) in different species (human, mouse, and rat), the multiple rearrangements in IR75 and some other tumors emphasize the selective value of c-myc activation by an immunoglobulin locus in the tumorigenic process.
