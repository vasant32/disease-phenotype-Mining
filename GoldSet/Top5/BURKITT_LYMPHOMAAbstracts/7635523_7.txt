A gene of unknown biological function, nbl, was originally isolated by virtue of its abundance in a Namalwa Burkitt Lymphoma cDNA library. nbl expression was initially found to be higher in tissues which exhibited internucleosomal DNA cleavage characteristic of apoptosis, than in tissues which did not exhibit a 'DNA ladder'. nbl expression was therefore examined in mouse thymus in vivo, in which apoptosis is induced by the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. nbl expression was markedly enhanced by dexamethasone treatment and then sharply decreased prior to the occurrence of maximal 'DNA ladder' formation. In contrast, expression of myc, which is believed to be involved in apoptosis in other cell systems, declined as thymic apoptosis increased. Thymic apoptosis was blocked by the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D, if administered when nbl expression was enhanced, but not before or after the peak of nbl expression. These results suggest that nbl expression is associated with thymic apoptosis.
