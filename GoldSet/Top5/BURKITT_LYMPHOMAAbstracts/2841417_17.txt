Experimental induction of malignant lymphomas can be achieved in the cottontop tamarin by inoculation with Epstein-Barr (EB) virus. This system provides an animal model for assessing the efficacy of vaccine protection against the virus which is intended to reduce the incidence of human tumours associated with EB virus infection, namely endemic Burkitt's lymphoma and undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Cottontop tamarins have been vaccinated with the major envelope glycoprotein of EB virus, gp340, incorporated into immune-stimulating complexes (iscoms) and were thereby protected against a 100% lymphomagenic dose of virus. The gp340 iscoms are highly immunogenic, requiring only a few micrograms of immunogen to induce protective immunity and thus would be a strong candidate for further development as an EB virus vaccine for use in man.
