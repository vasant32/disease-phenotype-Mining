During the period 1962-73 twenty-nine cases of Burkitt's lymphoma were seen and examined histologically in Khartoum, Sudan. Burkitt's lymphoma formed 20% of the cases of childhood lymphomas. The average age at presentation was 6.8 years and the male to female ratio was 3.8:1. The clinical features, the anatomical localization and histological appearances were similar to those reported in the literature. The geographical distribution of the tumour showed close correlation to that of holo- or hyperendemic malaria.
