An unusual case of lymphoma is presented in which small bowel intussusception due to a lymphomatous nodule caused an acute abdomen, requiring small bowel resection. Four weeks later a second intussusception caused intestinal obstruction, necessitating a second laparotomy and bowel resection. The high incidence of malignant tumor in adult cases leads us to recommend primary resection without manual reduction in all but rectosigmoid and selected small bowel cases.
