Cellular immune responses to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-associated antigens play an important role in the control of EBV-immortalized B lymphocytes. The nature of the antigens that serve as targets for these responses remains largely unknown. The purpose of the experiments reported here was to determine if virus-replication-associated antigens might function as targets for T-cell immunity with the emphasis on EBV-induced early antigen (EA) complex. Activated T-cell populations directed against this group of antigens would theoretically be effective in controlling the production of new virus progeny. Our results demonstrate that polypeptides associated with the EA complex do, in fact, induce the proliferation of memory T-cells from EBV-infected individuals irrespective of their serological status to the EA complex. The major polypeptide associated with the diffuse component of EA (EA-D) was notably effective in inducing a strong proliferative T-cell response. Cell lines established from EBV-infected individuals following continuous exposure to either p17 or p50 components of the EA complex over a 10- to 12-week period were composed primarily of CD4-positive T-cells, although CD8-positive cells also persisted for up to 9 weeks in culture. The data suggest that components of the EA complex might function as important target antigens in the immunosurveillance of EBV-infected cells.
