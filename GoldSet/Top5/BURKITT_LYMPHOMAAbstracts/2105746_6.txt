Excessive concentrations of L-methionine inhibited the folate-dependent de novo synthesis of thymidylic acid (TMP) in Raji cells, demonstrating the usefulness of this cell line for the study of methionine-folate antagonism. The effect was also produced by L-homocystine but not by other amino acids including D-methionine and L-ethionine, suggesting that this effect is exerted by a common intermediate of methionine and homocystine metabolism. L-Methionine, L-homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) are not inhibitors of thymidylate synthase activity. On the other hand the capacity of the cells to incorporate serine 3-carbon and glycine 2-carbon into DNA is impaired by the presence of L-methionine or L-homocystine. Studies with cell-free extracts demonstrated that the glycine cleavage enzyme is inhibited by 45% by L-methionine, L-homocysteine, SAM or SAH. Serine hydroxymethylase on the other hand was slightly stimulated by these sulfur-containing compounds and this stimulation was shown to occur in the intact cell as well. These findings suggest that when levels of L-methionine metabolites are elevated, there is an increase in the use of glycine to maintain the intracellular concentration of serine, which is required for homocysteine detoxification by conversion to cystathionine. The reduction in TMP synthesis caused by excess L-methionine or L-homocystine may result from increased utilization of one-carbon units for serine synthesis.
