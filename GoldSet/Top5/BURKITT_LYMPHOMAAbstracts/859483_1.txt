An Australian case of Burkitt's lymphoma is reported. The clinical features of large ovarian masses and subsequent bone marrow invasion, as well as the results of investigations related to the Epstein-Barr virus, were more consistent with the American than the African type of Burkitt's lymphoma. After a good initial response to cyclophosphamide and vincristine, the tumour rapidly became resistant to these and other therapeutic measures and the patient died 10 months after diagnosis.
