In this work we have isolated a cDNA clone encoding the B cell antigen CD75. The amino acid sequence of CD75 is shown to be identical to that of human alpha 2,6 sialyltransferase, believed to be primarily associated with the Golgi complex. This is the first demonstration of cell surface expression of sialytransferase which, in B cells, may play an important role in intercellular adhesion and antigen presentation events.
