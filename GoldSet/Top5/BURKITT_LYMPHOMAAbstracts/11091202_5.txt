We analysed 67 samples from Brazilian children of diverse ethnic origins with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) for the presence of the TEL-AML1 fusion gene transcripts using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All 12 positive cases (20% of the 60 B-cell precursor ALL) had common (CD10+) ALL with a mean age of 4 years (range 1-10 years). We conclude that the frequency, age, distribution and clinical features of the TEL-AML1 fusion gene-positive ALL is similar in the diverse ethnic backgrounds of the Brazilian children to that in other countries with predominantly white Caucasian or oriental ethnicity. Apparent exceptions to this generality are discussed.
