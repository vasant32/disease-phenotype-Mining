When peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were incubated with a streptococcal preparation, OK-432, for 24 h, PBMC acquired cytolytic activity against cultured and fresh human tumor cells. Such PBMC were called OK-432-activated mononuclear cells (OK-MC). OK-MC produce several kinds of cytokines such as interferon alpha (IFN alpha), IFN gamma, and tumor growth inhibitory factor (TGIF) both in vitro and in vivo. OK-MC-produced cytokines also inhibited the growth of cultured and fresh human tumor cells. The growth inhibition was examined by human tumor clonogenic assay using a double-layer agar technique. The results indicate that two pathways of anti-tumor activity are induced in OK-MC, i.e., cell-mediated and cytokine-mediated.
