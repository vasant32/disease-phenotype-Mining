Four-hundred and fifty nine cancer patients were skin tested with extracts from five lymphoid cell lines. More than 50% of patients with lymphoma had positive skin tests with the extracts prepared from the cell line derived from Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and more than 50% of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients reacted to the NPC-derived cell line extracts. Although the significant association between patient diagnosis and orgin of cell lines suggested that tumor-associated antigens were responsible for the pattern of delayed hypersensitivity, problems in standardization of antigen potency and non-specificity need to be resolved before this in vivo assay achieves its full potential.
