A glycoprotein antigen (gp40) was previously identified as a major component of immune complexes isolated from sera of patients with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In the present work gp40 was partially purified from a pool of BL/NPC sera. Sera of patients with BL and NPC as well as sera of patients with other malignant and non-malignant diseases were tested for antibodies against gp40, using a double antibody radioimmunoassay. Practically all normal sera and sera of patients with non-malignant diseases had antibodies capable of binding radioiodinated gp40. In contrast, sera of patients with BL or NPC had very low binding, while sera of patients with other malignant diseases had intermediate binding values. The low binding activity of BL/NPC sera was shown to be due to inhibition by excess gp40 present in such sera. Effusions of patients with breast or ovarian cancer also contained demonstrable amounts of gp40. The origin of gp40 is still unknown.
