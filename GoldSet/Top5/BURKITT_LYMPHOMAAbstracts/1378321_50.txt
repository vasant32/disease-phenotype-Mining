The bcl-2 oncogene blocks programmed cell death (apoptosis). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can immortalize B lymphocytes into continuously growing lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) by the coordinate expression of at least 9 latent genes (EBV nuclear antigen [EBNA] 1-6, latent membrane protein [LMP], and terminal proteins [TP] 1 and 2). We analyzed transcription and expression of bcl-2 and latent EBV genes in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines with a germinal center phenotype (group I) as well as activated BL cell lines (group III) and LCLs. We found high expression of bcl-2 as well as the full spectrum of latent EBV genes in LCLs and activated group III BL cell lines. Group I BL cells expressed little or no bcl-2, EBNA-2, and LMP. Superinfection with nondefective EBV or an EBNA-2-defective virus as well as transfection with EBNA-2- or LMP-carrying vectors into the EBV-negative cell lines RAMOS, DG75, U698, or BJAB induced upregulation of bcl-2 expression. The strongest effect on bcl-2 was obtained by transfection with LMP, or infection with the nondefective virus. No change of bcl-2 expression was observed with EBNA-1. Our data indicate that the immortalization capacity of EBV and the growth advantage of EBV-positive compared with EBV-negative BL cells in vitro may predominantly be mediated via induction of bcl-2 and the main effectors are EBNA-2 and LMP.
