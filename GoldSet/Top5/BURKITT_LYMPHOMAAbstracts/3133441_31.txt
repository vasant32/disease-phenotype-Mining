RJ 2.2.5 is an immunoselected mutant of the Burkitt lymphoma line Raji. It fails to display MHC class II antigens at the cell surface due to a transcriptional defect. We have identified the function of a regulatory factor that is defective in RJ 2.2.5 cells; this factor is absolutely required for the activity of an MHC class II gene enhancer.
