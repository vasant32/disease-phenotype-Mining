An Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific DNase was induced in EBV nonproducer Raji cells after treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and sodium butyrate. The increase in EBV DNase activity was related to the appearance of early antigen-positive cells. The enzyme had a sedimentation coefficient of 4S and was resistant to 300 mM KCl, and its induction did not depend on viral DNA synthesis. The EBV-specific DNase activity was specifically inhibited by sera from patients who had nasopharyngeal carcinoma with high early antigen activities but not by sera from normal, healthy individuals. There was a correlation between the degree of anti-EBV DNase activity and the titers of early antigen antibody.
