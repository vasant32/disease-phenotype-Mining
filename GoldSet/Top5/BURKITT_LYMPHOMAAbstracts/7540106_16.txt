Since antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity is considered an important mechanism by which mAbs may exert their antitumor effects, it seems likely that these antitumor effects can be enhanced by the activation of the appropriate effector cell populations. We have used nude mice xenografted with human Daudi tumor cells as a model to compare the antilymphoma effects of unconjugated CD19 (CLB-CD19) and CD20 (BCA-B20) mAbs (IgG2a subclass) alone or in combination with recombinant human interleukin 2 (rhIL-2) or recombinant mouse granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (rmGM-CSF). Treatment of established tumors with BCA-B20 or rhIL-2 or rmGM-CSF as a single agent, all resulted in highly significant decreases of tumor growth rates, but did not increase the number of complete regressions. The combination of CLB-CD19 or BCA-B20 mAbs with rhIL-2 or rmGM-CSF resulted in larger decreases of growth rates than either of the agents alone. Complete eradication of large Daudi tumors could be achieved when treatment with BCA-B20 mAbs was combined with rhIL-2, but not with the combination of CLB-CD19 mAbs and rhIL-2 nor with the combination of BCA-B20 mAbs and rmGM-CSF. Cured animals kept for 2-3 months after complete regression of the tumors were still tumor free. Regression of tumors was correlated with the infiltration of lymphocytes as well as macrophages into the tumor. This is the first report to show that unconjugated CD20 mAbs are to be preferred over unconjugated CD19 mAbs, and interleukin 2 over GM-CSF in the combinational treatment of large B cell tumors.
