From September 1983 to October 1988, 13 undifferentiated non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) of Burkitt's or non-Burkitt's type and 3 B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias were treated with various multiagent chemotherapy regimens containing modest to high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) infusions. All were children between the ages 2 years 8 months and 14 years 1 month. The group included 13 boys and 3 girls. The lymphomas were located primarily in the head and neck, 5; abdomen, 7; and lymph nodes, 1. The clinical stages at diagnosis were stage I, 1; stage II, 6; stage III, 3; and stage IV, 3. The MTX infusion dosage ranged from 300 to 4,285 mg/M2, and the total cumulative dose per patient ranged from 750 to 30,168 mg/M2. Citrovorum Factor Rescue was given following all MTX infusions, except for 62 of the 300 mg/M2 infusions. The serum MTX levels were monitored following all HDMTX. The chemotherapy related toxicities were graded and analysed. The clinical characteristics, which might predispose to HDMTX-related toxicities, were identified and are discussed. Our data reveals the inpatient and interpatient variations in the kinetics of MTX. There were no drug-related deaths, and the overall outcome of the patients was satisfactory. We conclude that MTX infusion continues to play an important role in the current management of childhood B cell malignancies; however, obstacles still remain, especially for those with widespread B cell disease.
