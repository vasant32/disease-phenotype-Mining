The goal of this study was to evaluate routine flow cytometric (FC) immunophenotypic markers in differentiating between Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and CD10+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We performed retrospective analysis of FC data from 55 patients. We evaluated 9 FC parameters: forward and side scatter (FSC and SSC); mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) for CD20, CD10, CD38, CD79b, CD43, and CD71; and the percentage of neoplastic cells positive for CD71 (%CD71). The FSC; MFIs of CD10, CD43, CD79b, and CD71; and %CD71 cells were significantly different between BL and CD10+ DLBCL (P < .05; Student t test). A 5-point scoring system (FSC, %CD71, and MFIs of CD43, CD79b, and CD71) was devised, and 6 (60%) of 10 BLs scored 3 or greater and 1 (10%) of 10 CD10+ DLBCLs scored 3 (P = .04; Ï‡(2)). Our findings indicate that routine FC parameters can aid in differentiating BL from CD10+ DLBCL.
