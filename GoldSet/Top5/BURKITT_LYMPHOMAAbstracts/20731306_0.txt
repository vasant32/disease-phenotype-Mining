OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to show the possible variations of early symptoms of haematological malignity during pregnancy and to summarize data about treatment modalities and possible management of gravidity in case of the disease. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and gynaecology, Charles University, 2nd Medical Faculty; 1st internal clinic - department of hematology, Charles University, 1st Medical Faculty, Prague. METHODS: Pubmed database was searched between years 1989 and 2009. The data we used focused on non- Hodgkin's lymphomas diagnosed during pregnancy, especially on Burkitt lymphoma. The treatment modalities, neonate outcomes and prognosis of the mothers were emphasised. CONCLUSION: The diagnostics of haematological malignities in pregnancy is difficult.
