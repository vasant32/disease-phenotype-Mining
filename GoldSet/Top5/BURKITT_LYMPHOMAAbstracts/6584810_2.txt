14 patients developed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and 1 patient developed Burkitt's leukemia following longterm chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for other disorders. The main primary disorders included multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and breast carcinoma. Acute leukemia developed earlier in patients treated by chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy than in patients treated by radiotherapy alone (63 months, range 24-132 months; 201 months, range 48 months to 30 years, respectively). 13 patients presented without organomegaly and 8 were pancytopenic. Abnormalities of myeloid and erythroid cell lines were observed in the majority of the patients. A high rate of acute erythroleukemia (5 out of 14) was found. Increased reticulin fibers were found in 3 patients. The leukemia was invariably refractory to treatment with a median survival of 4 months. The possible role of preexisting abnormal marrow structure in the development of therapy-related leukemia is discussed.
