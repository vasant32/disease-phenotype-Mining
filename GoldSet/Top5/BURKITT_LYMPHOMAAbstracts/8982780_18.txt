IL-12 has been shown to play a central role in cell-mediated inflammatory reactions through direct activation of T cells and NK cells. IL-12 also strongly influences humoral immunity but these effects have been thought to be indirect and caused by intermediary cytokines. Using flow cytometry, we now show that IL-12 directly interacts with B cells. Freshly isolated murine peritoneal B-1 and conventional B lymphocytes bound IL-12, but splenic B cells failed to react unless first stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. All murine B cell sources were found to express IL-12R beta 1 subunit transcripts as detected by PCR and RNase protection assays. IL-12 binding was also detected on phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human T cell blasts and Staphylococcus aureusl IL-2-stimulated B cell blasts but not on freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Similarly, IL-12 directly bound to the human SKW6.4 Burkitt's B cell lymphoma line. In all cases positive staining was ablated by omitting IL-12 from the procedure, showing that it was not due to detection of endogenous IL-12. These findings indicate that B cells represent another major target for IL-12 in addition to T and NK cells, and that IL-12 can directly affect humoral immunity.
