In Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells characteristic chromosomal translocations juxtapose the MYC oncogene to one of the three immunoglobulin (IG) gene loci. This results in deregulation of MYC expression through IG gene enhancer elements. As enhancers and MYC promoters can be as much as several hundred kilobases apart, long-distance effects are to be postulated, which affect chromatin organization. Since transcriptionally active and inactive sequences can be distinguished based on their localization in nuclear halo preparations, we used this technique to assess the topology of wild-type and translocated MYC and IGK genes. Following visualization of these genes by fluorescence in situ hybridization, the signal distribution was determined in nuclear halo structures of human monocytes and the BL-derived cell line LY66. MYC signals derived from the non-translocated chromosome 8 were found equally distributed between the residual nucleus and the surrounding DNA halo. In contrast, the activated MYC and IGK genes on the translocated chromosome in LY66 cells were associated with the residual nucleus in 78 and 88% of cases, respectively. In LY66 cells, attachment to the residual nucleus was restricted to a DNA segment 30 to 50 kb downstream of MYC, while in monocytes it was dispersed over 80 kb around the MYC gene. These findings indicate a specific chromatin organization for the activated MYC locus. Distance measurements between MYC and IGK signals revealed shorter values than expected from their linear distance (325 kb), indicating a back folding of the DNA backbone. Thus, there is strong evidence for a specific topological organization, which is functionally related to the MYC activation status with the specific folding of the DNA strand likely reflecting maintenance of a spatial interaction between IGK enhancer and MYC promoter elements.
