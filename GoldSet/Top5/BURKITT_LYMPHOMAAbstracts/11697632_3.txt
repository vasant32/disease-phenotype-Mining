An increased incidence of intermediate to high-grade Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma is found in individuals with AIDS. Although immune function in AIDS patients can be improved through the use of antiretroviral therapy, the contribution of these drugs to lymphoma regression is not known. Here we describe the complete regression and subsequent recurrence of high grade, Burkitt-like lymphoma during antiretroviral therapy in a patient with AIDS. Antiretroviral therapy resulted in diminished viral load and modest improvement in CD4+ T cell counts. Lymphoma regressed initially, but relapsed 3 months later. Tissue taken from the initial and recurrent tumor demonstrated different clonal rearrangements. The recurrent lymphoma did not respond to continued antiretroviral therapy. In Conclusion, antiretroviral therapy may contribute to lymphoma regression in AIDS lymphoma. Clinically recurrent disease may be clonally distinct.
