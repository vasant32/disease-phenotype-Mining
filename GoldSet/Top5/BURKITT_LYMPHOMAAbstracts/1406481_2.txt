Disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) associated with HIV infections are becoming increasingly important in the area of clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients with AIDS. The aim of this retrospective analysis of 20 patients with AIDS who died in 1989 was to compare clinical diagnosis, neuroradiological findings and treatment with the results of neuropathological studies. The neuropathological examinations revealed primary CNS lymphoma (high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) in seven cases, cerebral toxoplasmosis in four cases, haemorrhagic infarction in three cases, cerebral cryptococcosis in three cases, and one case each of infiltration of the dura by a peripheral Burkitt's lymphoma, cytomegalovirus encephalitis and bacterial meningitis. A remarkably high percentage of CNS lymphomas with no distinct clinical or neuroradiological differentiation criteria were found in this study. On the basis of these data, we conclude that stereotactic biopsy and histological diagnosis should be recommended for patients with focal intracerebral lesions who fail to respond to suitable anti-parasitic treatment.
