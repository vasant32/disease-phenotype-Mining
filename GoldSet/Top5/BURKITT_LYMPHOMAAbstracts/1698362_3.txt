HRF20, a 20 kDa homologous restriction factor, is a membrane glycoprotein anchored via galactosyl phosphatidyl inositol. Its function is to protect cells from attack by homologous complement. Adsorption of purified HRF20 to Raji cells which have little, if any, of this factor increased their resistance to cytolysis by homologous complement. However, the same cells treated with HRF20 remained sensitive to cytotoxic attack by IL-2 activated lymphocytes (lymphokine activated killer cells; LAK cells). Since LAK cells are effector cells which release perforin, HRF20 does not appear to protect cells from the damage caused by perforin.
