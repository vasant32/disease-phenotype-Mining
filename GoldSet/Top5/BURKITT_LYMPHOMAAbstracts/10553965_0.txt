 BACKGROUND: During a 10-year period (1986-95), 70 adult Papua New Guineans with head and neck lymphomas were seen in the 18 years-and-above age group. METHODS: The clinical information was obtained from the medical records section of the Port Moresby General Hospital. Relevant treatment modalities and the follow-up data were acquired from the National Cancer Centre, Angau Memorial Hospital, Lae. RESULTS: Of a total of 227 adult lymphomas recorded in a 10-year period, 70 cases were seen in the head and neck region. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma constituted 56 cases, which included seven cases of adult Burkitt's-like lymphoma. Fourteen cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: In Papua New Guinea, malignant lymphomas primarily affecting the head and neck region were seen in 30.8% of all lymphomas. This constitues 2.8% of all malignancies in this region. These lymphomas appear to be more aggressive at this site. Proper tissue diagnosis and combination chemoradiotherapy are the key factors in its management.
