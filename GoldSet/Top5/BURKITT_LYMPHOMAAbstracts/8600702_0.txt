A characteristic rectocolonic endoscopic finding is the presence of ulcers, which may correspond to different diagnosis. Between January, 1989 and May, 1993, we performed 28 colonoscopies and 12 rectoscopies in patients with HIV (+). In all cases, histologic, parasitologic, bacteriologic, virologic, and micrologic studies were practised on tissue biopsies. Eighteen of them presented rectocolonic ulcers (we are not including anal and terminal ileum ulcers). The studies involved 16 males and 2 females, with an average age of 31, 21 years old (20-47), 14 of which were male homosexuals, 2 intravenous drug abusers, 1 hemophilic and an heterosexual female. Symptoms were as follows: 15 with hematochezia, 7 with proctorrhagia, 6 with enterorrhagia and 2 with both manifestations. All the rest, presented chronic diarrhea, loss of weight, anal secretion, asthenia, fever, constipation and anemia in isolated cases. Diagnosis were 6 rectocolonic cytomegalovirus (all occurred during the current year). Other related opportunistic pathogens included an intestinal TBC, a rectal Herpes and a Burkitt's lymphoma. Related etiological agents were not found in 9 patients, in spite of systematic quest. Opportunistics found in three of the cases revealed AIDS in those patients. COMMENTS: 1-The indexes of male homosexuals are strikingly higher than the rest of our HIV endoscopy statistics. 2-We observed prevailing idiopathic lesions. 3-The relationship between "CU like" pictures, already described, and the immunocomponents of the idiopathic CU is unknown. 4-All our CMV cases are recent. 5-Hematochezia was the most frequent symptom. 6- Herpetic ulcers correspond to HSV type 1. 7-Diffuse ulcers may correspond to lymphoma.
