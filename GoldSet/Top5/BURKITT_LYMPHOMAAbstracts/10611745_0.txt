To identify a cell surface molecule other than CD4 involved in infection of cultured cells with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), mice were immunized with the CD4-negative Raji human B-cell line in order to isolate a monoclonal antibody (mAb). We isolated mAb 33A, which inhibited the infection of CD4-positive T cells, B cells, human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), and brain-derived cells with HIV-1. Formation of viral DNA was also blocked when CD4-positive Raji cells were treated with 33A after adsorption of HIV-1, but not before its adsorption. mAb 33A had little effect on syncytium formation induced by cocultivation with HIV-1-producing cells. Flow cytometry revealed that 33A reacted with HTLV-I-positive T-cell lines, Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) -stimulated PBL, brain-derived fibroblast-like cells, and some adherent cell lines, but hardly at all with immature T-cell lines. Immunoblotting experiments showed that 33A recognized an antigen with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa, but did not recognize chemokine receptors such as CXCR4, CCR5, or CCR3. The distribution characteristic of the antigen recognized by 33A on various cells and its molecular weight suggest that mAb 33A recognizes a new cellular antigen that is necessary for HIV-1 entry.
