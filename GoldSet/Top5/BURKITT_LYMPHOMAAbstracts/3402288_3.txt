A four-year-old boy had a cecoanal intussusception prolapsing through the anus. A 4 x 4 cm cecal tumor served as the leading point of the intussusception. Laparotomy and histology revealed that the tumor was a solitary Burkitt's lymphoma of the cecum. Isolated Burkitt's lymphoma, as presented here, is rare, and such a combination has never been reported. Intussusception prolapsing through the anus and Burkitt's lymphoma are discussed, as well as a possible reason for the rarity of the condition.
