Short-term intensive chemotherapy regimens have substantially improved the prognosis of pediatric patients with Burkitt lymphoma (BL), which now has an excellent overall outcome. However, central nervous system (CNS) involvement at diagnosis remains a poor prognostic factor, and progressive or relapsed disease in the CNS is associated with even worse outcomes. We report 3 boys aged 4, 7, and 12 years treated under the French Société Française d'Oncologie Pédiatrique LMB 89/96 protocols who presented, respectively, with CNS-/bone marrow+ stage-IV BL; CNS+ stage-IV BL; and stage-I BL. Each experienced an isolated CNS relapse, which was treated with CNS-directed salvage chemotherapy. All 3 are alive after 11 years of median follow-up, indicating that this chemotherapy regimen can be curative in pediatric BL with isolated CNS relapse.
