Analysis of the plain chest radiographs of 11 children with Burkitt's lymphoma showed that mediastinal adenopathy was the commonest abnormality present. One child showed a pulmonary infiltrative pattern which had previously been undescribed in this disease. Nigerian children with this lymphoma present more commonly with mediastinal glandular enlargement whereas pleural effusion is more frequently encountered in Caucasians.
