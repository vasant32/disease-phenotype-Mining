This study records the disease profile and outcome of all 492 children with confirmed cancer below the age of 15 who were admitted to Tygerberg Hospital, South Africa, from 1983 to 1993. The black (48.3%), so-called coloured (30.3%) and caucasian (21.3%) children did not represent a confined geographical area. Leukaemia (22.8%), brain tumours (20.5%), lymphomas (15.2%), nephroblastomas (10%), neuroblastomas (8.5%) and retinoblastomas (5.7%) were the most common tumours. All children were treated with standard protocols and included in the Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. 14 patients were lost to follow-up. Projected survival in (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) ALL was 63% in white children, but only 17% in black children. Survival was 65% in stage 1 and 2 Wilms' tumour, and exceeded 50% in medulloblastoma and astrocytoma. So-called African Burkitt's lymphoma occurred in all population groups. Overall, 5-year survival in Hodgkin's disease was 70%. Black and coloured children with neuroblastoma presented mainly with stage 3 and 4 disease. All 26 black and coloured children with retinoblastoma had a negative family history and advanced disease which needed enucleation.
