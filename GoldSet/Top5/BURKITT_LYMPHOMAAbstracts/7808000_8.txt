The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and the classical non-specific cross-reacting antigens (NCAs) belong to the CEA gene family which is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. In normal hematopoiesis, CEA gene family members (CGMs) have only been reported on cells of myeloid and monocytic origin. In the present study, we analyzed 62 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) and seven surface immunoglobulin positive (sig+) B-cell lines for the expression of the CEA family members CEA, NCA-50/90, NCA-95, NCA-160, CGM1 and CGM7. We demonstrated that members of the CEA family were present in 76% of childhood ALLs of B- and T-cell origin. In ALLs of B-cell origin, 82% of the samples expressed at least one CEA subgroup member: 38% NCA-50/90 (CD66c), 31% NCA-160 (CD66a), and 13% both. Six of seven B-cell lines solely expressed NCA-160. In seven ALL of T-cell origin, sole NCA-160 expression was present in 29% of the cases. CEA and CGM1 were not expressed in childhood ALLs or in the sIg+ B-cell lines. In 15 ALLs and seven B-cell lines which could be analyzed for CGM7 expression, the antigen was not detected. NCA-95 was not expressed in 91% of the B-lineage ALLs, in T-lineage ALLs and in the B-cell lines. However, five B-lineage ALLs showed conflicting data on the binding patterns of two, on leukocytes specifically NCA-95 recognizing antibodies suggesting either expression of unknown forms of NCA-95 or NCA-50/90 or of a yet unknown member of the CEA family in these ALL cells. The expression of CEA subgroup members in childhood ALL cells might have prognostic impacts, as an inverse correlation exists between NCA expression on leukemic blasts and the risk factor white blood count at diagnosis.
