Stimulation by the ganglioside IV(3)NeuAc-nLcOse(4)Cer leads to growth arrest in the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Raji. In order to analyze the primary response of Raji cells to that stimulus, a cDNA array screen and a suppression subtractive hybridization-PCR approach were performed. Twenty-four genes with assigned functions were confirmed to be induced by the ganglioside in reverse Northern blot experiments covering e.g. protein kinase B, phospholipase C, the MAP-kinase ERK3, the transcription factors YY1, DR1 and NSEP, the membrane traffic protein TAP, and the nuclear export protein CRM1. Most of the genes identified are involved in signal transduction, transcription, and cell trafficking. For selected genes, the induction of expression was quantified by semiquantitative RT-PCR.
