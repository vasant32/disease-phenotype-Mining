Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) receptor activity in cell free extracts is operationally defined as one which causes a reduction in the effective concentration of the early antigen inducing particles of an EBV preparation when the latter is preincubated with the extract before infection. Such activity was detected in the surface extract of Raji cells and to a lesser extent in that of BJAB cells, both of which are B lymphoblastoid cells that are susceptible to infection with EBV. Receptor activity was not detected in similar extracts of P3HR-1 cells and human diploid fibroblasts neither of which are known to be susceptible to EBV infection. Receptor activity in the Raji cell extract was found to be associated with membranous structures. This may have rendered the activity resistant to treatment with trypsin and sonication. The activity was however abrogated if the extract was exposed to neutral detergent. Binding of receptor activity was observed when Raji cell extract was chromatographed on a column of immobilized EBV. Subsequent electrophoretic analysis showed however that this procedure did not result in an appreciable purification of the receptor activity. Neutral detergent treated extract was similarly chromatographed. The resulting eluates did not contain detectable receptor activity but were less heterogeneous in protein content as compared with that of the original extract. It is not certain at present if these EBV binding proteins are involved in the receptor activity of the extract.
