Data from developed countries place the malignant hemopathies among the most frequent cancers in children. The epidemiologic and prognostic aspects of these diseases are not well known in developing countries notably in Africa sub-Saharan countries because of lack of registry and clinical collaborative studies. Nevertheless, the good progress in the management of paediatric diseases that were a big concerns in former times authorize to think that in future, these countries will be engaged in programs to fit malignant diseases as major health problems in children. A good knowledge of epidemiologic aspects of these diseases must be therefore an important concern. This study describes epidemiologic and prognosis particularities of malignant hemopathies in children diagnosed in a last referral hospital ward, Bamako, Mali (West Africa) during height years. Fifty-nine cases of malignant hemopathies were diagnosed by January 1996 to December 2003 in 19 females and 40 males. Data were analysed retrospectively with SPSS 11.0. These children were aged from 4 to 15 years and the modal class of age was 6-10 years. The mean recruitment of cases per year was 7.37. Lymphomas were more frequent (70%) particularly the Burkitt lymphoma. The Hodgkin's lymphoma was not observed under 5 years of age but represents 24% of cases over this age and was more frequent in male. This study emphasizes the need to put in place strategies for a better understanding of epidemiological aspects of malignant hemopathies in children and for developing policies to improve management and prevention of cases in Mali.
