Chromosome studies were performed by EBV positive African Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. Variant translocations were found in 4 cases: two with t(2;8) (p12;q23 ou 24) and two with t(8;22) (q23 or 24;q11). Identical translocations were observed in EBV positive or negative non-african lymphomas or Burkitt type leukemia. These results show the uniqueness of Burkitt lymphoma leukemia and stress the importance of chromosome 8 rearrangement in this tumor.
