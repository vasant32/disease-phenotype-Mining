Henle, Gertrude (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pa.), and Werner Henle. Immunofluorescence in cells derived from Burkitt's lymphoma. J. Bacteriol. 91:1248-1256. 1966.-Indirect immunofluorescence tests led to the brilliant staining of a small proportion of the cells in five different cultures derived from Burkitt's (African) lymphomas. The reaction was not restricted to the 17 sera from cases of this disease but extended to many sera from American individuals, whether healthy donors or patients suffering from a variety of illnesses. The incidence of positive sera increased with age from about 30% in childhood to > 90% in adults. Fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated human gamma-globulins were suitable for direct staining of the same proportion of cells. The stained cells appeared to be in varying stages of degeneration, but cultural conditions leading to an increase in the cellular death rates failed to result in a rise in fluorescent cells. Several observations suggest that the stainable cells might be those which are seen to harbor virus particles under the electron microscope. Two cell lines derived from leukemic patients in this country also contained a small fraction of stainable cells but two others, and numerous primary human leukocyte cultures, gave consistently negative results. Attempts to relate the staining to known viral antigens have failed to implicate herpes simplex, varicella, cytomegalo, and reo viruses types 1, 2, and 3. The nature of the virus carried by the lymphoma cells as well as of the staining reactions remains to be determined.
