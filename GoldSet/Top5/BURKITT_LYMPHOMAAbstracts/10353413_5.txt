Acute renal failure in Burkitt lymphoma is commonly the result of tumor lysis syndrome. We present a 15-year-old boy who developed hypertension, seizures, and acute renal failure due to extrinsic compression of the bladder and ureters by a large retrovesical Burkitt lymphoma. The causes of acute renal failure in Burkitt lymphoma and the incidence of acute urinary obstruction in this disease are reviewed.
