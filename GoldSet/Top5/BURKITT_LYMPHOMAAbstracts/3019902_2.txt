Ultrastructural modifications are described in the plasma membrane of in vitro established human B cells. By the freeze-fracture technique, intramembrane particles (IMPs) are quantified in B lymphocytes following Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformation in vitro, and in B-lymphoma (Burkitt-type) cells, either positive or negative for EBV genome. Analysis shows an overall increase in IMP density as compared to normal controls. Differences are observed between the protoplasmic and exoplasmic faces of fractured membranes as well as among in vitro transformed and clearly neoplastic cells. Results indicate that conformational changes in IMP distribution parallel neoplastic evolution of transformed cells.
