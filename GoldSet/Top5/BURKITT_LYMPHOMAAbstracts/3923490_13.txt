Although it is known that the c-myc oncogene is rearranged in a head-to-head fashion with the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus in mouse plasmacytomas, it has not been clear whether the c-myc oncogene is translocated to the heavy chain locus on mouse chromosome 12 or whether the heavy chain locus is translocated to the c-myc locus on mouse chromosome 15. To determine which of these two possibilities is correct, we hybridized Chinese hamster fibroblasts with J558 mouse plasmacytoma cells that carry a reciprocal chromosome translocation between chromosomes 12 and 15, and we examined the segregating hybrids for the presence of the normal and rearranged mouse c-myc genes, for the presence of different regions of the mouse heavy chain locus, and for the presence of genes located on mouse chromosomes 12 and 15. The results of this analysis indicate that, as in human Burkitt lymphomas with the 8;14 chromosome translocation, the c-myc gene is translocated to the heavy chain locus in mouse plasmacytomas. Thus the orientation of the heavy chain locus on mouse chromosome 12 and of the c-myc gene on mouse chromosome 15 is the same as the orientation of the homologous loci in man.
