The clinical pattern of Burkitt's lymphoma of the cord seen in 20 patients over a five-year period is reported. The age incidence suggests that involvement of the spinal cord occurred in the older child when compared to the child with the jaw tumour. In contrast to the remarkable survival in children with Burkitt's lymphoma of other sites, the results of treatment of of cord involvement have been disappointing. Surgery did not alter the downhill course of the disease.
