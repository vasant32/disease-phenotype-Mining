This report deals with a case of AIDS-related Burkitt's lymphoma in which some of the earliest findings were dental and periodontal in nature. The patient presented initially with painless and extremely loose teeth accompanied by progressive paresthesia of the lower jaw. Unique radiographic findings included extensive periodontal ligament space widening and bulbous, granuloma-like lesions about the apices of the teeth. These findings were associated with progressive tumor infiltration of the mandible and do not appear to be related to other reports of aggressive periodontitis associated with impaired immunologic functions in AIDS patients.
