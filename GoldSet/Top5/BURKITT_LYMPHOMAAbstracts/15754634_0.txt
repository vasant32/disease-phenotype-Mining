 UNLABELLED: About 7% of all childhood cancers comprise non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). NHL are heterogenous group of neoplasms deriving from lymphatic system (cell B and T). B-cell NHL characterize by high malignancy, but coincidentally good reaction for treatment. In about 20% primary tumour is localised within head and neck, and nasopharynx lymphomas comprise 10%. This location maintains the biggest diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties because of tumours of this site proliferate in the region of frequent infections postponing a proper diagnosis and the local control after complete treatment is difficult. AIM OF THE STUDY: The authors analyse clinical symptoms before diagnosis, the incidence of nasopharynx lymphomas, histopathological type of neoplasm, clinical stage, results of treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study includes 97 patients who were treated because of lymphomas between 1993-2002. The character of clinical symptoms and their duration, histopathological type of lymphomas, results of treatment were analysed. RESULTS: The primary nasopharynx location was assessed in 9 patients (9.3%). Sex: 7 boys, 2 girls, age: 2-17 years. The duration which elapsed from initial clinical symptoms to diagnosis was 2-10 weeks. The histopathological assessment in 6 children was Burkitt lymphoma and in 3 children--Burkitt-like lymphoma. Metastases: CNS--1 patient, bone marrow--1 patient, abdomen--1 patient. Treatment was performed according to LMB-89 protocol. RESULTS: First complete remission--7 patients; second complete remission--2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphomas of nasopharynx cause diagnostic problems because of their early stage pseudo-inflammatory manifestation. Special attention should be paid to perform imaging studies (MRI/CT), which are useful in the reaching the proper diagnosis. The radiologic evaluation of primary lesion is still difficult. In the doubtful cases, the surgery and histopathological examination are necessary.
