Human cell lines established from cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphosarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma and multiple myeloma and representing stages of B-lymphocyte development ranging from pre-B through to plasma cells, were assessed for their ability to produce and respond to B-cell growth factors (BCGF). All B-cell lines studied were found to be constitutive producers of a growth activity which assisted the S-phase entry of normal activated B-cells and provided growth support for lymphoblastoid cells transformed by Epstein-Barr virus. Furthermore, all lines responded by enhanced proliferation to supernatants from a BCGF-producing T-cell hybridoma. Not all lines, however, displayed autostimulation to their own supernatants and no tumor B-cell line appeared totally dependent on soluble factors for its growth. Non-tumorigenic B-cell lines, by contrast, revealed a strict dependency on homologous growth factor for their continued proliferation in suspension culture. The findings support a progression model of lymphomagenesis based upon the utilization, production and, ultimately, emancipation from growth-promoting soluble factors.
