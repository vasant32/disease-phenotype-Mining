Bone marrow samples of 16 patients (two adults and 14 children) with a B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), and in whom Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements were detectable at diagnosis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were studied during evolution using PCR. The VDJ junctional fragment of the Ig heavy chain rearranged gene was amplified at diagnosis. After length reduction by restriction digestion, the amplified fragment was recovered by chromatography, labelled using a specific hexamer as a primer and directly used as a clonospecific probe. The sensitivity of the PCR ranged from 1:10(4) to 1:10(5) cells, depending on the patient's rearrangement. Residual disease (MRD) was detected in most of the patients achieving a complete remission after induction therapy, regardless of the long-term outcome of treatment. However, in patients remaining in complete remission, the level of MRD showed a tendency to decrease and ultimately become undetectable for variable periods of time, while in patients eventually relapsing there was a trend for MRD to persist at stable levels and even to increase before relapse was clinically evident. We conclude that the use of a simplified methodology for obtaining a clonospecific probe from the Ig heavy chain gene, though less sensitive than the sequencing methodology, is a valuable and readily available tool to monitor MRD in a high proportion of B lineage ALL.
