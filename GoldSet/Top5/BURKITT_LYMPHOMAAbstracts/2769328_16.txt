Primary lymphoma of bone (PLB) occurs infrequently in children. Between January 1962 and November 1988, 395 children with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Eleven of these patients (2.8%) presented with a bone primary, usually in the femur (eight of 11 patients). The median age of these seven boys and four girls at presentation was 13 years (range, 5.5 to 19 years). Seven patients had one or more additional bones involved. All patients had high-grade lymphomas based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Working Formulation. The histologic subtypes included six large-cell lymphomas, three lymphoblastic lymphomas, one small-noncleaved, non-Burkitt's lymphoma, and one unclassifiable lymphoma. Treatment consisted of multiagent chemotherapy combined with local radiation therapy in seven of 11 patients. Six of 10 children who received chemotherapy as a component of their initial therapy, including all who presented with localized tumor, are alive with no evidence of disease 2+ to 85+ months (median, 42.5 months) after cessation of treatment; one patient has just completed chemotherapy. Each of the four patients who died showed leukemic conversion 5 to 11 months after diagnosis, and three died of progressive disease. One patient died of sepsis during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia with no evidence of disease at necropsy. We conclude that optimal therapy for PLB, as with all other forms of NHL, should focus on the histologic subtype and stage of disease.
