Recently, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been found not only to be associated with Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma but also with some T-cell malignancies. Cytogenetic studies were performed on four Chinese patients with EBV-associated T-cell neoplasms: three peripheral T-cell lymphomas and one large granular lymphocyte leukemia with coexpression of T-cell antigen. Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were detected in all four patients. Rearrangements of chromosome 7 were observed in three patients: one at 7p22, one at 7q35 or 36, and the remaining one at both sites. The last patient also had a chromosomal abnormality involving 14q11. Trisomy of part of the 1q segment was detected in two patients. The results revealed that the chromosomal abnormalities in these patients were similar to those observed in other T-cell lymphomas. Further studies on more patients are necessary to find out whether there are specific chromosomal aberrations in EBV-associated T-cell neoplasms.
