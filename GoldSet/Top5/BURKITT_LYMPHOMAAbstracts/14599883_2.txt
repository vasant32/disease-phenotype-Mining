 OBJECTIVES: Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) occurs mostly in children. Isolated bilateral ovarian involvement presenting with amenorrhea is extremely rare in young adults. CASE: A 24-year-old female presented with secondary amenorrhea. Bilateral adnexal masses were identified on physical examination and abdominal computed tomography (CT). She underwent total abdominal histerectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy. Histopathologic evaluation yielded a diagnosis of BL of ovaries. Combined chemotherapy was administered. After complete remission an autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) was performed. She died 35 days after ABMT. CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, BL should be kept in mind when isolated ovarian tumors are detected in young patients.
