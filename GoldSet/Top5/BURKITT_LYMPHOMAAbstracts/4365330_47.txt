When Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) negative cells (Raji) were treated with iododeoxyuridine, only the early antigen (EA) component was induced. There was no significant increase in EBV DNA and no virus particles were observed. Somatic-cell hybrids were prepared from the fusion of Raji and D98 cells (D98/Raji). When these cells were treated with iododeoxyuridine, early antigen EBV DNA, and virus particles were synthesized. These data suggest cellular control over the expression of the EBV genome.
