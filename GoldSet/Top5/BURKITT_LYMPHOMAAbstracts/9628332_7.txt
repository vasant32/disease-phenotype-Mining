We analyzed the methylation patterns of CpG dinucleotides in the regulatory region of the latent Epstein-Barrvirus (EBV) promoter BCR2 (also called C promoter, Cp) using automated fluorescent genomic sequencing after bisulfite-induced modification of DNA. BCR2 is one of the alternative promoters for transcripts encoding the growth-transformation-associated nuclear antigens EBNA 1-6 which are expressed in a host cell phenotype dependent manner. Well characterized clones isolated from the Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) line Mutu differing from each other as to their phenotype and EBV latent gene expression were used in the present study. We found that in Mutu BL III clone 99 which is actively using the BCR2 promoter the regulatory sequences are unmethylated with two exceptions (position 10702 and 10799). In contrast, there are 15 methylated cytosines in the same region in Mutu BL I clone 216 where the BCR2 promoter is silent. Cytosines which are potential targets of DNA methyltransferase in the immediate vicinity or within the attachment sites of cellular C promoter binding factors CBF1 and CBF2 remained hypomethylated in Mutu BL I clone 216. This suggests a role for a hypermethylated region (nucleotides 10666 -10865, -639 to -440 bases upstream from the beginning of the TATA box at position 11305) in silencing of the BCR2 promoter in these cells.
