BACKGROUND: Non-Hodgkin lymphomas, a common AIDS-defining manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are aggressive, advanced at diagnosis, and tend to involve extranodal sites. Burkitt lymphoma comprises approximately 20% of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Sites frequently affected by the disease include the central nervous system, bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, and mucocutaneous tissue. Gonadal involvement is less common; reports of testicular lymphomas in adult males with AIDS have been sporadic. Ovarian involvement in AIDS-related lymphoma is exceedingly rare and usually involves pediatric patients. CASE: We report an unusual case in which disseminated Burkitt lymphoma presented as pelvic pain in a 32-year-old woman with AIDS. At laparoscopy, the ovaries were unremarkable in appearance but at the upper limits of normal size. However, extreme friability of the left ovary led to hemorrhage and oophorectomy. Pathologic evaluation of the ovary resulted in the diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma. CONCLUSION: With improved survival because of antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of AIDS-related lymphomas is expected to rise. Lymphoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of women with AIDS with perplexing abdominal or pelvic symptoms.
