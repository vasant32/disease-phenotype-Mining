Cell lines established from T-cell leukemias have recently been reported to exhibit a chromosome translocation t(8;14) involving proto-oncogene c-myc and the gene of the T-cell receptor alpha-chain(TcR-alpha). In this work, we have studied a case of T-cell leukemia presenting a t(8;14)(q24;q11) translocation that was found in fresh leukemic cells taken during relapse, but was absent in cells collected at diagnosis. Hybridization analysis showed that the breakpoint on chromosome 8 was located 3' to the c-myc exon 3. A TcR-alpha-specific original probe (D14S7, Mathieu-Mahul et al., 1985) revealed two differently rearranged patterns in DNA from leukemic cells obtained at diagnosis and during relapse. In contrast, the rearranged TcR-beta-gene DNA pattern did not change during the course of the disease, indicating that leukemic cells were clonally related. These data indicate that the chromosome breakpoint in 14q11 is situated in the TcR-alpha locus. These results suggest that translocations t(8;14) involving TcR-alpha and c-myc genes in T-cell malignancies are analogous to variant t(2;8) and t(8;22) translocations observed in Burkitt lymphoma. They also establish that the same types of molecular rearrangements due to a t(8;14)(q24;q11) translocation, at first described in T-cell lines established in culture, also exist in vivo and may play a role in the evolution of the leukemic process.
