A 4-year-old boy was hospitalised because showing signs of weakness, slight pain in the abdomen and while urinating. The symptoms occurred 7 days before hospitalisation. The boy did not vomit, nor did he have the urge to vomit, the defecation was regular showing no traces of blood. The physical visit a soft and painless tumefaction was confirmed ileocecally. The echography tests and the computed tomography suggested invagination, not excluding the second substrate. Barium enema showed irreductible invagination. The operative test showed that it was about the ileocolic invagination with extreme thickening of the cecum, the ascedental colon, the intestine and the retroperitoneum walls. A resection of the small intestine and a ileocolic anastomosis was performed. The pathohistological test shows the primar abdominal Burkitt's lymphoma. In spite of the subsequent therapy the boy dies three weeks after the first symptoms' manifestation. We, herewith, suggest at the importance of the echography analysis when diagnosing the Burkitt's tumor and give advantage to this analysis against the computerized tomography. We also point at the huge level of malignancy of the Burkitt's tumor in this boy.
