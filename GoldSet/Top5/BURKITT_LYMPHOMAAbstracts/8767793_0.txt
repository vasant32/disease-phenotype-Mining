Ultrasonography can be used to guide fine needle biopsy of suspected malignant liver lesions. In Abidjan this method allowed cytologic identification of 63 liver lesions disclosed by ultrasonography. In 53 cases (84%) including 41 hepatocarcinomas, 4 Burkitt's lymphomas, and 8 metastases, cytology confirmed malignancy. In 10 cases, initially supposed to be hepatocarcinomas (6 cases) or metastases (4 cases), cytologic findings led to a different diagnosis of either cirrhosis, abscess, or necrotic tissue (4 cases). No complications were observed in this series of 63 ultrasonically guided biopsies. This safe, easy, sensitive, and cost-effective technique should be used to identify the solid tumors. This indication is common in Black Africa where these tumors are common.
