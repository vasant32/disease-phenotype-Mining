One hundred abdominal and chest CT scans in 29 patients with American Burkitt lymphoma were reviewed. Abdominal and/or pelvic masses were the most common finding and were detected in 13 (45%) patients. Masses indicating relapse were noted in three (10%) additional patients. Ascites and retroperitoneal involvement were noted in seven and five patients, respectively. Other findings included hepatic lesions, splenomegaly, gastric wall abnormalities, renal enlargement, urate nephropathy, and bony involvement. Pleural effusions and two mediastinal masses were noted on chest scans. CT was found to be a rapid screening procedure and especially useful in delineating the size and intrathoracic extension of abdominal masses, defining deep pelvic diseases, assessing the response to therapy, and defining areas of relapse. Lack of retroperitoneal fat and inadequate opacification of bowel loops were frequent problems that limited the value of CT scans.
