Primary cardiac lymphoma (PCL) is a rare and usually fatal malignancy, seldom reported in children. This report describes the case of a 10-year-old boy who presented with multiple intracardiac masses which, when biopsied, proved to be small non-cleaved cell (Burkitt's) lymphoma. The first two cycles of chemotherapy according to the LMB 96 protocol were given under close cardiological supervision, with good response. The treatment was then continued with full-dose chemotherapy, without any cardiological complication. The patient who was treated by chemotherapy alone remains in complete remission 36 months after the end of treatment and can presently be considered as cured, without late cardiac effect.
