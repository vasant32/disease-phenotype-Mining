The patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and abdominal pain presents the surgeon with a difficult challenge. The pain may be due to an opportunistic infection, ileus, organomegaly, or a true surgical emergency. The hospital records of 235 patients with AIDS were reviewed. Of the 29 patients with abdominal pain, 12 had infectious diarrhea, eight were diagnosed as having ileus or organomegaly, and nine had miscellaneous causes for their pain. Only five patients underwent laparotomy. Two patients were operated on for pain associated with bleeding (Meckel's diverticulum and intestinal Kaposi's sarcoma); one had a perforated duodenal ulcer and one had severe ileitis. One patient was electively operated on for Burkitt's lymphoma. Laparotomy for abdominal pain is not usually necessary in patients with AIDS. Specific recommendations for evaluation and management of these patients are offered.
