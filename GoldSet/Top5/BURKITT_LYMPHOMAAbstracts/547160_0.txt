Burkitt lymphoma in the United States has not been reported in a child under the age of one year. We report here a nine-month-old child who had facial involvement and a rapidly downhill course. This occurred despite an early response to combination chemotherapy and vigorous supportive measures. Electron microscopic examination of the tumor is also presented.
