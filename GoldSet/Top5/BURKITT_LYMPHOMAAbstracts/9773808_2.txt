Mitoguazone (methylglyoxal bisguanylhydrazone, methyl-GAG or MGBG) is a synthetic polycarbonyl derivative with activity in patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, head and neck cancer, prostate cancer, and esophageal cancer. Mitoguazone has also recently been documented to have activity in patients with AIDS-related lymphoma. Among anticancer drugs, mitoguazone has a unique mechanism of action via interference with the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. Polyamines stabilize DNA structure by non-covalent cross-bridging between phosphate groups on opposite strands. In addition, mitoguazone causes uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. In this study, the ability of mitoguazone to induce apoptosis by inhibiting the polyamine pathway was assessed in three Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (Raji, Ramos and Daudi) and one prostate carcinoma cell line (MPC 3). Additional evaluations were performed in two human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 with wild-type p53 and VM4K with mutated p53) to determine whether the p53 tumor suppressor gene was required for efficient apoptosis induction. The present study demonstrated that mitoguazone induces apoptosis in all the different human cancer cell lines tested in a concentration- and time-dependent way, and triggers a p53-independent programmed cell death in the human breast cancer MCF7 cell line.
