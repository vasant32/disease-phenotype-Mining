134 cases of paediatric tumours of the jaws in Nigerian children are reviewed. Non-odontogenic tumours and tumours of mesenchymal origin were the commonest. Among malignant disease cases, Burkitt's lymphoma predominated. Late presentation for treatment and gross disfigurement were typical clinical findings. Most of the non-Burkitt malignant lesions had grown to inoperable proportions and the few that were amenable to aggressive surgery responded poorly to treatment.
