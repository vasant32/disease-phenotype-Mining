The role of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in lymphoma remains uncertain. We have analyzed 1185 allogeneic transplants for lymphoma reported to the EBMT registry between 1982 and 1998 and compared the results with those of 14687 autologous procedures performed over the same period. Patients receiving allogeneic transplants were subdivided according to histology: low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) 231 patients; intermediate-grade NHL 147 patients; high-grade NHL 255 patients; lymphoblastic NHL 314 patients; Burkitt's lymphoma 71 patients; and Hodgkin's disease 167 patients. These patients received allogeneic transplants as their first transplant procedure. Actuarial overall survival (OS) at 4 years from transplantation was: low-grade NHL 51.1%; intermediate-grade NHL 38.3%; high-grade NHL 41.2%; lymphoblastic lymphoma 42.0% years; Burkitt's lymphoma 37.1%; and Hodgkin's disease 24.7% years. These outcomes are relatively poor because of the high procedure-related mortality associated with these procedures, particularly in patients with Hodgkin's disease (51.7% actuarial procedure-related mortality at 4 years). Multivariate analysis showed that for all lymphomas apart from Hodgkin's disease, status at transplantation significantly affected outcome. A matched analysis was performed: for all categories of lymphoma, OS was better for autologous than for allogeneic transplantation. Relapse rate was better in the allogeneic group for low-, intermediate- and high-grade, and lymphoblastic NHL. It was equivalent for Burkitt's lymphoma and worse in the allogeneic group for Hodgkin's disease. Allogeneic transplantation appears to be superior to autologous procedures in terms of producing a lower relapse rate. The toxicity of allogeneic procedures must however be reduced before this translates into an improvement in OS.
