A rational, multidisciplinary approach to Hodgkin's disease and the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas has been responsible for major advances in therapy. Invasive diagnostic procedures and exploratory laparotomy, with their associated complications, make nontraumatic radionuclide imaging most appealing in both the clinical staging of disease and in evaluating therapy. Gallium-67-citrate, the tumor scanning agent of the early 1970's, has demonstrated a marked affinity for Hodgkin's disease and the other lymphomas. False positives are few, with sensitivity greater than 70% throughout the spectrum of Hodgkin's disease and the histiocytic lymphomas. In addition to confirming sites of suspected neoplasm, this agent has proved useful in the detection of occult involvement. Moreover, resolution of abnormal gallium-67 concentrations on follow-up studies functions as a visual ancillary index of therapeutic response. The value of wholebody gallium-67 scintigraphy is further enhanced when used in conjunction with routine technetium brain, bone, liver, and spleen scans. While the diagnostic accuracy of gallium-67 studies has been limited in the abdomen due to bowel activity, our attempts to improve these results with the tumor-seeking radiopharmaceutical indium-111-Bleomycin were unrewarding and subsequently were discontinued. Finally, radionuclide lymphography has also been explored. Its diagnostic usefulness in detecting pelvic and abdominal lymph node involvement warrants further investigation.
