Aneuploidy is a frequent feature in multiple myeloma. Cytogenetic analyses have shown that a 14q+ chromosome resulting from either a t(8;14)(q24;q32) or a t(11;14)(q13;q32) was the most consistent abnormality but no specific chromosomal aberration has been identified in this disease. Bone marrow cells from 121 consecutive patients with multiple myeloma were analyzed cytogenetically by standard banding techniques including RHG, GTG and CBG banding. Cells were cultured for 24-96 h in the presence or in the absence of interleukin-6. Clonal abnormalities were detected in 41 of the 121 patients (34%). A der(16)t(1;16)(q10;p10) abnormality was identified in nine of these 41 patients (22%). Der(16) was identified at diagnosis in five patients, during disease progression in two additional patients, and at the time of a relapse in the two last cases. The t(1;15)(q10;p10) translocation was always unbalanced, resulting in a monosomy 16q in all cases. The CBG banding did not demonstrate dicentric chromosomes and the whole chromosome painting confirmed the der(16). A large number of other chromosomal abnormalities were associated with der(16), including chromosomal rearrangements involving the 8q24 band in five cases. Four of these five cases were Burkitt's-type translocations. This observation suggests that der(16)t(1;16)(q10;p10) could be one of the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities that can be identified in multiple myeloma cells.
