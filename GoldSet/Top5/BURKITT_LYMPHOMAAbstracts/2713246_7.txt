In a previous study (Burkitt lymphoma study I, BL I) between 1982 and 1984, we used a multidrug rotating chemotherapy schedule, now known as 'GRAB', to treat 24 Iraqi children with non-localised BL (Murphy stages II, III and IV). At the time of reporting, actuarial survival was 50% (current actual survival 42%) and the major morbidity and mortality was not from resistant or relapsed lymphoma, but from complications of the tumour lysis syndrome, sepsis and early abdominal surgery. The study (BL II) reported here was carried out between 1984 and 1986; we used GRAB to treat 24 newly and consecutively diagnosed children with advanced Burkitt lymphoma but discouraged early 'debulking' surgery and paid special attention to supportive care during the first two weeks of treatment. As in BL I, no radiotherapy was used. Twenty patients (83.8%) attained complete remission: 17 (71%), including three of the seven stage IV patients, survive continuously disease-free at a median of 26 months (range 18-36 months) from diagnosis. We have previously pointed out that GRAB, without radiotherapy, may be especially suited for use in some developing countries. From this study we conclude that, with appropriate supportive care and minimal surgery, survival rates over 50% may be achieved. Our next studies are aimed at defining a 'good risk' group of patients, who may be curable without alkylating agents and a 'poor risk' group, who need more intensive therapy.
