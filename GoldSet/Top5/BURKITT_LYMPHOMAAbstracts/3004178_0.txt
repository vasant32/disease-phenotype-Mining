In a retrospective study eleven cases with Burkitt's lymphoma have been diagnosed at three rural hospitals in the Sidamo and Gamu Gofa Regions of South Ethiopia. The clinical picture is heterogeneous with an abdominal mode of presentation being most frequently observed. It is concluded that South Ethiopia has an incidence of Burkitt's lymphoma between that of endemic countries (e.g. Uganda) and non-endemic countries such as the USA.
