In this study, we examined myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene expression in a series of 31 non-infant pro-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients that included 16 cases with the t(4;11) translocation and/or the resultant ALL1/AF4 chimaeric gene. Sixteen out of 31 cases (51%) were MPO mRNA positive/enzyme negative. MPO mRNA was detected in nine out of 16 (56%) and seven out of 15 (47%) patients with and without the ALL1/AF4 fusion transcript respectively. The comparative study between MPO mRNA positive and negative cases showed statistically significant differences with regard to age and white blood cell (WBC) count, and was 39.5 years vs. 26.3 years (P = 0.016) and 71.4 x 10(9)/l vs. 157.8 x 10(9)/l (P = 0.046) in the MPO mRNA positive and negative groups respectively. The correlation analysis between MPO mRNA expression, age, WBC count and leukaemic relapse according to the presence/absence of the ALL1/AF4 fusion showed that the statistically significant differences observed in the whole group were related mostly to the ALL1/AF4-positive ALL patients. In fact, in this latter group, the mean WBC count and patients' age were 85 +/- 79 x 10(9)/l vs. 289.8 +/- 102 x 10(9)/l (P = 0.0005) and 44.8 +/- 15.3 years vs. 26.7 +/- 13.7 years (P = 0.01) in patients with and without MPO mRNA expression respectively. It appears, therefore, that the assessment of MPO mRNA expression enables a further dissection of leukaemia heterogeneity in apparently homogeneous genetic/immunophenotypic ALL subsets.
