A 26-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of abdominal mass. She became ileus and an emergency operation was consequently performed. A histological examination of the abdominal tumor indicated proliferation of undifferentiated lymphoblasts with intermingled histiocytes so called "starry sky appearance". The diagnosis was Burkitt's lymphoma. On the 4th post-operative day, a cardiac tamponade became evident. The pericardial effusion contained many lymphoblasts and the diagnosis was pericarditis due to the invasion of lymphoma cells. The pericarditis was successfully treated by infusion of doxycycline into the pericardial space following drainage. The patient responded to systemic chemotherapy with complete remission. 7 courses of systemic chemotherapy along with intrathecal infusions for CNS prophylaxis were subsequently carried out. A state of complete remission has continued for more than 13 months. Cardiac tamponade accompanied by Burkitt's lymphoma is quite rare and has not ever been reported in Japan in our knowledge. The efficacy of surgical treatment before systemic chemotherapy and the series of intrathecal infusions for CNS prophylaxis was demonstrated in this case.
