Cultured cells derived from male patients with Burkitt's lymphoma and harboring herpes-type virus particles were lethally irradiated. These irradiated cells induced normal peripheral leukocytes of female infants to grow within 2 to 4 weeks after mixed cultivation. Cells of a line free of this agent failed to stimulate growth. If either type of cell was cultured separately, it did not survive under the experimental conditions. Herpes-type viral antigen and C-group chromosomal marker previously described in cultured Burkitt cells were found in all of the female cell cultures that were obtained.
