 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of miR-9 in B lymphocytes, B cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) cell lines and its significance. METHODS: CD19(+) B lymphocytes were sorted from normal lymph node by magnetic beads. Total cellular micro-RNA was extracted from cHL cell line L428, B cell lymphoma cell lines Ly1 and Ly10 (diffuse large B cell lymphoma), Raji cells (Burkitt's lymphoma) and CD19(+) B lymphocytes, respectively. These micro-RNAs were separately transformed into cDNA by reverse transcription. The expression levels of miR-9 were measured by fluorescence quantitative PCR. In situ hybridization was used to detect the expression of miR-9 in cell lines. RESULTS: The expression of miR-9 was high in L428 cells (104.44 ± 1.61), and low in cell lines of B cell lymphoma (Ly1: 2.17 ± 0.38; Ly10: 1 ± 0.015; Raji: 2.65 ± 0.89), and extremely low in CD19(+) B lymphocytes (0.0026 ± 0.00040). Compared with that in the other cell lines, the expression of miR-9 in L428 cells was statistically significant (P < 0.05). miR-9 localized in the cytoplasm diffusely and strongly in L428, but scattered and slightly with some prominent distribution around the nuclear membranes in Ly1 and Ly10, and only weakly in Raji. CONCLUSIONS: miR-9 highly expressed in cHL cell line and might be a molecular marker for diagnosis and treatment of cHL.
