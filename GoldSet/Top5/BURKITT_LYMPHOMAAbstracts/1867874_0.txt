Burkitt's lymphoma of a ten-year-old boy with specific 8;14 and variant 2;8 translocations is reported. The post mortem diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma was based on histological picture and the cytogenetic findings of the tumor biopsy. The child died four days after clinical admission. Because of the rapid progression of the disease immunological and serological investigations could not be performed. Therefore several questions remained unclarified. It is supposed that in the patient's B-lymphocytes multiple transformation events occurred leading to the development of the polyclonal lymphoma, similarly to that described in transplant-associated lymphoproliferations.
