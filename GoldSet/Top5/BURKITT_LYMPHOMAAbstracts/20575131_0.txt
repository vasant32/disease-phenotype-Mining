Screening of a library of structurally unusual osmacyclic complexes for their antiproliferate properties in HeLa cells led to the discovery of a highly cytotoxic eta2-allene osmacycle. In this remarkably stable complex, osmium constitutes part of a metallacycle through the formation of a sigma-bond to a carbon in combination with coordination to an allene moiety. The osmacycle strongly induces apoptosis in Burkitt-like lymphoma cells at submicromolar concentrations. The reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential, the induction of DNA fragmentation, and the activation of caspases-9 and -3 reveal that programmed cell death occurs through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. From the lipophilic and cationic nature of the osmacycle, in addition to a low oxidation potential (E1/2=+0.27 V vs. Fc/Fc+, Fc=ferrocene) it is proposed that mitochondria are the cellular target where oxidative decomposition initiates apoptosis.
