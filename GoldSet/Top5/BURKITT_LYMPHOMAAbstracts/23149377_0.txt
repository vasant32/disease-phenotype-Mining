 AIM: This retrospective study was conducted to evaluate information on paediatric lymphoma in China. METHODS: We reviewed the pathological files of patients less than 12 years of age with lymphoma in Shanghai Xinhua Hospital from January 1982 to June 2009. SPSS version 11.0 was used to analyse the results. RESULTS: Of the 213 subjects, 176 (82.6%) had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 37 (17.4%) had Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). All NHL cases had diffuse and high grade tumours, and 33.5% of these tumours primarily involved extra-nodal sites. Of the NHL cases, 56.6%, 43.3%, and 1.7% were derived from T, B, and null cells, respectively. Lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL, 50.6%), Burkitt's lymphoma (BL, 28.4%), and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL, 12.5%) comprised the majority of the NHL cases. A significant difference was found in the frequency of stage I/II cases between LL and ALCL. Paediatric HL resembled the disease in adults. CONCLUSIONS: Paediatric lymphoma in China is different from that in Western countries with respect to the incidence rate of HL and BL. The distribution pattern of NHL histological subtypes is more similar to that in Japan than that in Pakistan. These features suggest ethnic or geographic variations.
