 AIMS: The diagnosis of primitive hematologic malignancies depends on a panel of monoclonal antibodies which is growing over time. The distinction between immature (lymphoblastic lymphoma/acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) and mature lymphoma is sometimes difficult. In this study, we evaluated anti-TdT antibody in the diagnosis and classification of these proliferations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 13 lesions were examined by immunohistochemistry: 4 B and T lymphoblastic lymphomas, 2 Burkitt's lymphomas, 5 B and T acute lymphoblastic leukemias and 2 acute monoblastic leukemias. RESULTS: TdT expression is specific of immature lymphoid proliferations (T or B lymphoblasts). TdT is not expressed by mature B or T cell lymphomas such as Burkitt's lymphomas. Significant numbers of cases of acute myeloblastic leukemias are TdT positive but could be easily distinguished from lymphoblastic proliferations. CONCLUSION: Anti-TdT antibody represents a useful marker for differentiating lymphoma/acute lymphoblastic leukemia from other lymphomas. This marker, available in routine diagnosis should be systematically included in the panel of antibodies used for immunophenotyping hematologic malignancies.
