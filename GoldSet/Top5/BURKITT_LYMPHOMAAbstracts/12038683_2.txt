The role that Epstein-Barr virus plays in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Burkitt's lymphoma has been under intense study for many years. With only a limited set of viral genes being expressed in these tumours it has been difficult to understand how the virus could cause/aid in the generation of the tumours. In 1997 a paper was published by Fries et al. [Fries et al. (1997) Identification of a novel protein encoded by the BamH1 A region of the Epstein-Barr virus. J Virol 71: 2765-2771.] in which a rabbit serum was generated and used to identify protein products (RK-BARF0) encoded from the BamH1 A region of EBV. In this paper we have isolated these proteins from two-dimensional gels and identified them, using mass spectrometry, as components of HLA DR.
