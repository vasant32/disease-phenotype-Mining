The T24 transitional bladder carcinoma cell line, the Daudi Burkitt lymphoma cell line and the K562 erythroleukemia cell line have all been used as target cells in 51Cr release assays to measure the in vivo induced lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell cytotoxicity during interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy of cancer patients. However, different relationships between the clinical response to IL-2 treatment and the LAK cytotoxicity have been reported using these three different target cells. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether the LAK cytotoxicities measured against these target cells represent similar effector-to-target-cell interactions, so similar conclusions may be drawn of 51Cr release assay results in which the cell lines are used as target cells. The cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and PBMC depleted of different natural killer and T cell subsets was measured against the three targets. LAK cell recognition of targets was evaluated by cold target inhibition experiments, and the development of LAK-cell-mediated lysis with time was evaluated in 51Cr release assays of varying duration. This study shows that LAK-mediated lysis of T24 and Daudi cells was closely related and LAK cytotoxicity measured in 51Cr release assays against these two target cells may be measurement of similar effector-to-target cell interactions.
