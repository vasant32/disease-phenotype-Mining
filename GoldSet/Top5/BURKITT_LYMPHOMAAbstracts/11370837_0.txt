The most recent therapeutic approaches can improve the outcome of B-cell neoplasia. By PCR analysis we amplify tumor specific DNA sequences of clonal IgH rearrangement from a limited number of malignant cells against a background of normal B cells. Recently described PCR based techniques for tracking minimal residual disease (MRD) in B lymphoproliferative disorders have given promising but discordant results, with significant variations in the sensitivity and specificity of the procedures. We have developed a three step single strand conformational polymorphism polymerase chain reaction (SSCP-PCR) strategy which is able to detect clonal malignant cells in B lymphoproliferative disorders at a frequency as low as 1 in 10(6) cells. Since this method is simple, rapid, reliable and as specific as ASO-PCR, it could be especially useful in monitoring patients affected by B lymphoproliferative disorders in complete haematological and immunophenotypic remission.
