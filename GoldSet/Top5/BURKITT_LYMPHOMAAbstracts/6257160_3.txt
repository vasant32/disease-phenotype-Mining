Efficacious systems are described for the large-scale growth in tissue culture and concentration of infectious (P3HR-1) and transforming (B95-8) Epstein-Barr virus. Also recorded here are our updated procedures for growing stock cultures and protocols to harvest fluids containing biologically active virus which is infectious or transforming. Various methods of concentrating biologically active Epstein-Barr virus have been evaluated. Cellular debris can be removed efficiently and rapidly from culture harvest fluids by clarification through a JCF-Z continuous-flow rotor. Efficient and reliable virus concentration was achieved by molecular filtration with Millipore Pellicon cassettes, using flow rates to 10 liters/h to produce fivefold concentrates followed by pelletization in a fixed-angle rotor. Data from recent production lots showed an average infectivity titer for P3HR-1 virus of 10(4.5) early antigen units per ml (100-fold concentrate) and 10(5.7) transforming units per ml (200-fold concentrate) for B95-9 virus lots.
