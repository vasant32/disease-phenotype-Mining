 PURPOSE: We discuss the clinical, laboratory findings and treatment of a boy who developed Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) after renal transplant and some issues about lymphoproliferative disorders after transplantation. METHODS: A 6-year-old boy with Drash syndrome developed disseminated Burkitt's lymphoma 38 months after transplantation for renal failure. Immunosuppressive therapy had consisted of prednisolone and cyclosporine. Polychemotherapy was initiated. RESULTS: Polychemotherapy induced rapid and complete remission of the disease without major side effects despite the renal transplant allograft and prolonged immunosuppression. CONCLUSIONS: A child with posttransplantation B-cell high-grade lymphoma can be successfully treated with the same chemotherapy regimen used for ordinary cases.
