 INTRODUCTION: Extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) were commonly described in AIDS patients and are related with an atypical morphology and aggressive clinical course. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single institutional study we evaluated the epidemiological, clinical, immunological, virological, histopathological and the outcome of eleven HIV/AIDS patients with oral cavity lymphomas (OCL). RESULTS: Nine were males and seven intravenous drug abusers. The median of age was 33 years and the median of CD4 T cell counts at the time of diagnosis was 97 cell/µL. The majority of tumors presented as large and ulcerated masses involving the gingiva, the palate and the jaw. Six of these tumors were diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL); three were Burkitt's lymphomas and the final case was a plasmablastic lymphoma. An association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was found in three of the ten tested cases by in situ hybridization (EBER 1 and 2 probes) and immunohistochemistry (LMP-1). Human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in only one neoplasm. Six patients died without specific treatment; four received chemotherapy and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and three of them presented a prolonged survival. DISCUSSION: Combination of HAART and chemotherapy should modify the poor prognosis of AIDS patients with OCL.
