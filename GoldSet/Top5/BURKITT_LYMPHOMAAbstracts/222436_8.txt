The beta2-microglobulin/HLA deficient Burkitt lymphoma line Daudi was tested for sensitivity to EBV-specific cytotoxicity mediated by natural killer (NK)-depleted T-cells from acute mononucleosis patients. While the Daudi line was not as sensitive as the reference EBV-genome-positive target line, it was clearly sensitive in the majority of cases. This would speak against a major role of syngeneic restriction in this system.
