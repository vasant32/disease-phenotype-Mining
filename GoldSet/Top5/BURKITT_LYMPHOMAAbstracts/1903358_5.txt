The chromosomal location of the lambda-like gene cluster, a gene family selectively expressed in human pre-B cells, was analyzed by in situ hybridization with a probe specific for the lambda-like genes. This cluster mapped in the q11.2-q12.3 region of chromosome 22. The use of Burkitt lymphoma and myelogenous leukemia cell lines with translocations in the 22q11 region led to a refinement in the location according to the following order: cen----BCRL2, VpreB, IgV lambda 1----BCRL4, IgV lambda----IgC lambda----BCR----BCRL3, lambda-like----tel. Unlike those of the mouse system, the pre-B-specific genes VpreB and lambda-like do not belong to the same transcriptional unit.
