We report a case of a 27-year-old woman with a known history of Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL), who presented with a rapidly enlarging nodule in the suprapubic area. Skin biopsy of the suprapubic nodule was consistent with cutaneous involvement of BLL. BLL is a highly aggressive B-cell lymphoma with a high proliferative rate. Like Burkitt lymphoma, BLL is characterized by a translocation of the c-MYC proto-oncogene. Histopathologic characteristics are considered borderline between those of classic Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Cutaneous involvement of BLL is rare and poorly documented in the literature.
