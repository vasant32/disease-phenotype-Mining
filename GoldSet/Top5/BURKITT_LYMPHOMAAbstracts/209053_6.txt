We have used human-mouse somatic cell hybrid to study the association between the EBV genome and the cellular genome. Attempts were made to identify a specific human chromosome(s) with which the EBV genome is associated. Our data suggest that at least in the mouse fibroblast/Burkitt lymphoma hybrid combination studies, the EBV genome is not associated with any specific human chromosome.
