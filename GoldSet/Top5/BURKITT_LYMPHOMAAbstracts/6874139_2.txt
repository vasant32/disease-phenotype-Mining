Flow karyotype analysis was performed to assess the feasibility of fluorescence-activated sorting of Burkitt lymphoma (BL)-associated translocation chromosomes. The typical 14q+ chromosome in the t(8;14) and the two "variant translocations", the 2q+ in the t(2;8) and the small 22q- in the t(8;22), could be identified as single peaks within the flow karyotypes of metaphase chromosomes isolated from several different BL-lines for each translocation. The translocation chromosomes could be separated with a high degree of purity and in quantities suitable for biochemical analysis. The same analytical and preparative technique was also successfully applied to the identification and sorting of the Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome in a 9;22 translocation-carrying CML-derived line and a familial (11;22) translocation.
