Progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle is regulated, in part, by the pRB-family proteins, pRB and p107. The basis for this regulation is due to a network of interactions between the pRB-family proteins, pRB, p107, and p130; the E2F-family of transcription factors; and cyclins D, E, and A. One of the pRB-family proteins, p107, has also been found to bind to the transactivation domain of the c-Myc proto-oncogene. This region in c-Myc is frequently mutated in tumors such as Burkitt's lymphoma, HIV-associated lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. The binding of p107 and regulation of c-Myc may conceivably be disrupted not only by mutations in c-Myc, but possibly by mutations in p107. In order to determine if mutations in p107 are indeed present in mouse B-cell tumors which exhibit a lower frequency of c-Myc mutation, we have cloned the mouse p107 cDNA and compared this sequence with its human counterpart. We find that the extreme N-terminal and C-terminal regions are the most conserved between human and mouse p107 sequences. Chromosomal positioning of the locus for p107 (designated Rbl1) as well as E2f1 to the distal end of mouse Chromosome (Chr) 2 also suggests a close but unlinked genetic relationship between these cell cycle regulatory transcription factors.
