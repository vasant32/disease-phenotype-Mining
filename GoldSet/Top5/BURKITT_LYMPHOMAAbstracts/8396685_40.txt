Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA has been detected in peripheral T-cell lymphomas. In this study, analysis of the EBV termini indicated that the infection was clonal and nonpermissive. Analysis of viral expression detected the processed, spliced mRNAs representing EBNA1, LMP1, LMP2, and BamHI A transcripts in all EBV-positive peripheral T-cell lymphomas. The LMP1 protein was detected by immunofluorescence in a single specimen. In contrast, neither the EBNA2 protein nor the spliced EBNA2 mRNA were detected. These data indicate that EBV-infected T-cell lymphomas are clonal expansions of a single EBV-infected cell with a pattern of gene expression which is distinct from that detected in Burkitt's lymphomas or posttransplant lymphomas but similar to viral expression in nasopharyngeal carcinomas.
