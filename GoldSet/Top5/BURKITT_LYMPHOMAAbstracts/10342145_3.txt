One hundred and twenty-eight cases of tumours involving the oral and the maxillofacial region and the oropharynx were reviewed. The objective was to highlight the late presentation of orofacial tumours in Nigeria. Patients who presented with squamous cell carcinoma, ameloblastoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, fibrous dysplasia and pleomorphic adenoma between January 1993 and December 1997 were selected. The socio-economic class of each patient was noted. Ignorance and poverty were the main reasons for the late presentation of 120 patients who belonged to the lower social class. Four middle-class patients and four upper class ones gave marital problems and a sense of despair as reasons for the delay in seeking treatment. Difficulties in their management are attributed to the advanced stage of the tumours and the high rate of patients' default. There is the need to emphasize not only the necessity for early presentation but also the establishment of adequate facilities in this country, and other developing countries, for effective treatment of these tumours.
