Rearrangements of the heavy chain immunoglobulin gene and T cell receptor beta gene were investigated in 25 patients suffering from precursor B cell acute leukaemia and six patients suffering from T cell acute leukaemia using biotinylated DNA probes. All precursor B acute leukaemia patients had IgH gene rearrangements and 63% of those studied also had TCR beta gene rearrangements. All T cell acute leukaemia patients had TCR beta gene rearrangements and germline IgH configuration. Dilution experiments indicated that DNA from leukaemic cells representing 1-2% of a tested sample could be detected using this technique which compares favourably to radioactive DNA probes.
