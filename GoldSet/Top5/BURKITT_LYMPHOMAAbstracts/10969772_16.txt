To increase the valency, stability, and therapeutic potential of bispecific antibodies, we have constructed a tetravalent tandem diabody (Tandab) that is specific to both human CD3 (T-cell antigen) and CD19 (B-cell marker; S. M. Kipriyanov et al., J. Mol. Biol., 293: 41-56, 1999). It was generated by the functional dimerization of a single chain molecule that contained four antibody variable domains (V(H) and V(L)) in an orientation that prevented intramolecular pairing. Compared with a previously constructed heterodimeric CD3 x CD19 diabody, the Tandab exhibited a higher apparent affinity to both CD3+ and CD19+ cells and longer blood retention when injected into mice. Biodistribution studies in mice bearing Burkitt's lymphoma xenografts demonstrated specific accumulation of the radioiodinated Tandab in a tumor site with tumor-to-blood ratios of 1.5, 8.1, and 13.3 at 3, 18, and 24 h, respectively. Treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency mice bearing established Burkitt's lymphoma (5 mm in diameter) with human peripheral blood lymphocytes, Tandab, and anti-CD28 MAbs resulted in the complete elimination of tumors in all of the animals within 10 days. In contrast, mice receiving human peripheral blood lymphocytes in combination with either the diabody alone or the diabody plus anti-CD28 MAbs showed only partial tumor regression. These data demonstrate that the CD3 x CD19 Tandab may be a promising tool for the immunotherapy of human B-cell leukemias and lymphomas.
