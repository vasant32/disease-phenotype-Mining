Immunophenotyping of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children using three-color flow cytometry was carried out at Chulalongkorn Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Of 38 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 65.8% were identified as common ALL, 15.8% were B-ALL, and 18.4% were T-ALL. Of these 38 cases, there were 4 cases of infantile leukemia. Relapsed cases of leukemia were found most in B-ALL up to 3 out of 6 cases and to a lesser extent in T-ALL (1 of 7 cases) and c-ALL (1 of 25 cases). Our data showed the CD markers expression for common ALL (c-ALL) were CD19+/10+ (100%), CD20+ (24%), CD22+ (100%), HLA-DR+ (70.1%), and CD34+ (58.8%). CD markers expression for B-ALL were CD19+ (100%), CD20+ (33.3%), CD22+ (80%), and HLA-DR+ (80%). CD markers expression for T-ALL were CD3+ (42.9%), CD5+ (100%), CD7+ (85.7%). Myeloid aberrant expressions were found in c-ALL (25-37.5%), B-ALL (20%), and T-ALL (14.3%). The significance of the aberration is discussed. The immunophenotyping classification of ALL as c-ALL, B-ALL, and T-ALL is useful in prognosis and treatment.
