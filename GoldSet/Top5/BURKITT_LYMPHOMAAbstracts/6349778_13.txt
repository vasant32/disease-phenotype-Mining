With the understanding that Burkitt's lymphoma was of follicular center cell (FCC) derivation, Lukes and Collins classified the tumor, descriptively, as small noncleaved FCC lymphoma. Two subtypes were described: Burkitt and non-Burkitt. Attempting to define the clinicopathologic features of the subtypes, we studied 42 patients: 25 Burkitt and 17 non-Burkitt. Histologically, the Burkitt tumor demonstrated remarkable uniformity of nuclear size and contour, whereas the non-Burkitt variant had greater variability. Immunoglobulin monoclonality was demonstrated in 83% of Burkitt and 81% of non-Burkitt cases. Burkitt patients tended to be younger. Gastrointestinal disease was seen in 15 Burkitt and only four non-Burkitt patients (P less than 0.05). Disseminated disease was found in the majority of both variants. Marrow involvement was demonstrated in 4.5% of Burkitt and 37.5% of non-Burkitt patients (P less than 0.05). Median survival of Burkitt patients was 10.5 months versus 7.7 months in the non-Burkitt group. The authors believe that significant biologic differences between the variants have been demonstrated, which may be of potential value to the clinician.
