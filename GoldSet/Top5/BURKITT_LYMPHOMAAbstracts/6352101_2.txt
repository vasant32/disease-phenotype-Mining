Binding inhibition and sequential immunoadsorption studies with two rat monoclonal antibodies have been used to demonstrate the existence of distinct populations (isotypes) of HLA-DR like (class II) molecules in human B lymphoma cell lysates. The structures of the molecules isolated by these two reagents have been compared by peptide 'mapping' and appear to be closely similar.
