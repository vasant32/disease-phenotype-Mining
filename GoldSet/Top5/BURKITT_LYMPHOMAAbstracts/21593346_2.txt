 AIMS: In recent years the genetic aberrations associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and the new subtype described in the 2008 revision of the WHO classification, 'B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma' have been increasingly well defined. Recurrent genetic abnormalities include rearrangements involving MYC (8q24), BCL2 (18q21) and BCL6 (3q27); as the prognostic and therapeutic implications associated with these abnormalities are clarified their accurate identification at diagnosis is becoming increasingly critical. We describe our experience of using a panel of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) probes on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections in the diagnostic work-up of 162 patients with non-Burkitt high grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (HG-BNHL). METHODS: BCL6, IGH-BCL2 and MYC status were determined prospectively in sequential patients presenting with HG-BNHL, with respect to the presence of rearrangements and copy number changes. Small numbers of samples were analysed retrospectively or were studied at relapse in previously untested patients. RESULTS: FISH analysis was successful in 160/162 (99%) cases, with abnormalities detected in 118/160 (74%). CONCLUSIONS: FISH analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections is a highly reproducible technique with an excellent success rate for the detection of genetic abnormalities which will play an increasingly important role in improving risk stratification of patients with HG-BNHL.
