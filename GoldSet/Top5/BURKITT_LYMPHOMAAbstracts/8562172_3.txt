We sequenced the region encoding the amino-terminal phosphorylation sites of C-MYC in the Ig/MYC translocation-carrying Burkitt lymphomas (BL), mouse plasmacytomas (MPC) and rat immunocytomas (RIC). Mutations affecting the Thr-58 codon or the immediate flanking region were found in seven of the 10 in vitro propagated BL lines. No mutations were found in any of the eight BL biopsies analysed. Germ-line sequences were also found in six in vivo and five in vitro passaged MPCs and in four in vivo transplanted RICs. These findings indicate that mutations in this region do not represent a general phenomena in Ig/MYC translocation-carrying tumours, but may confer growth advantage on BL cells under continuous in vitro propagation.
