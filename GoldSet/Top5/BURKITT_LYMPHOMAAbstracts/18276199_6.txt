We report the use of dielectrophoresis (DEP) to position U-937 monocytes within a non-uniform electric field, prior to electroporation (EP) for gene delivery. DEP positioning and EP pulsing were both accomplished using a common set of inert planar electrodes, micro-fabricated on a glass substrate. A single-shell model of the cell's dielectric properties and finite-element modeling of the electric field distribution permitted us to predict the major features of cell positioning. The extent to which electric pulses increased the permeability of the cell membranes to fluorescent molecules and to pEGFPLuc DNA plasmids were found to depend on prior positioning. For a given set of pulse parameters, EP was either irreversible (resulting in cytolysis), reversible (leading to gene delivery), or not detectable, depending on where cells were positioned. Our results clearly demonstrate that position-dependent EP of cells in a non-uniform electric field can be controlled by DEP.
