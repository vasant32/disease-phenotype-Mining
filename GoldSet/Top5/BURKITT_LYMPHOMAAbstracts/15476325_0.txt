 OBJECTIVE: To detect the expression levels of telomere binding factor 2 (TRF2) mRNA in tumor tissue of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. METHODS: The target gene mRNA was amplified with RT-PCR, then was sequentially electrophoresed and purified as standards, and the standard curves of gene expression were established. The expression levels of TRF2 mRNA of lymphoid tissue from NHL and reactive lymphoadenopathy were detected with real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: The correlation coefficient was 0.996 between the amount of template cDNA and the intensity of fluorescence signal when gene expression standard curves were established. The correlation coefficient of template cDNA amount and grey density of bands derived from gel electrophoresis of real-time RT-PCR final products was 0.779 (P<0.05). Of all NHL patients, expression levels of TRF2 mRNA of follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma were(22.943 +/-9.424) amol, (23.181 +/-5.983) amol and (18.339 +/-7.910) amol, respectively, which had no significant difference compared with reactive lymphoadenopathy [(21.796 +/-4.800) amol, P>0.05]. The expression level of TRF2 mRNA of Burkitt lymphoma was (33.170 +/-12.841) amol, which was significantly higher than that of reactive lymphoadenopathy and other types of NHL (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Alcohol drinking isn't one of the risk factors of colorectal cancer among Jiashan County population.
