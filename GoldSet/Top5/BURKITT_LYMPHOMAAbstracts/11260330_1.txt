The cellular prion protein (PrPc) is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked cell surface protein, which is expressed at high density on nervous tissues and at lower levels on most other solid-organ tissues. It is also expressed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of all lineages. In lymphocytes, its level of expression is dependent upon the state of cell activation, and polyclonal anti-PrP antisera partially block lectin-induced T-cell activation, suggesting a functional role of the protein in this process. Using the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3F4 we examined PrPc surface immunoreactivity on leukaemic cell lines of T- and B-cell origin, and unexpectedly observed a complete lack of PrPc cell-surface expression in Daudi cells, while all other cell lines displayed discernible reactivity. We demonstrated the intracellular presence of PrP-specific mRNA and PrP protein. The lack of surface PrPc is unrelated to the well-known defect of beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) expression in Daudi cells as other beta2m-deficient cells, such as the melanoma cell line F0-1 and spleen cells from beta2m gene-deleted mice, were not deficient in cell-surface PrPc. Daudi cells failed to bind antibodies directed against all GPI-linked cell surface proteins. In somatic hybridization experiments using murine spleen cells as partners, we observed de novo expression of human PrPc, CD55 and CD59, thus demonstrating in Daudi cells the availability of these gene products for GPI linkage and cell-surface expression.
