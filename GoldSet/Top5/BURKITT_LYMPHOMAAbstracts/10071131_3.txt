Expression density and function of Fas (APO-1/CD95) on malignant B-cells, an antigen thought responsible for abnormal tumor biology, remains to be fully understood. Fifty-five cases with B-cell neoplasms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), hairy cell leukemia (HCL), B-cell malignant lymphoma (ML), and myeloma (MM) were studied for qualitative and quantitative expression and function of Fas using flow cytometry and annexin-V staining methods. Fas expression was flow cytometrically unimodal with heterogeneous density and showed quantitatively characteristic features among different diseases; weak in ALL, faint in CLL, moderate in HCL, and strong in ML, respectively. Not only full-length but also alternatively spliced truncated mRNAs were detected even in leukemic B-cells with qualitatively faint or negative Fas, and then band density of the former transcripts by RT-PCR was correlated to the Fas protein expression level. Short-term culture of freshly isolated cells gave rise to increases of Fas density and susceptibility for apoptosis, suggesting that the mRNA and inducible Fas are functional at least in vitro. These results show that Fas is a biological marker for characterizing B-cell neoplasms reflecting various stages of B-cell ontogeny and may have clinical utility as a therapeutic strategy.
