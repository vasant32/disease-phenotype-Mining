We have analyzed paraffin sections from 32 children with histologically confirmed Burkitt's Lymphoma (BL) for the presence of EBV using in situ hybridization to detect expression of the EBV-encoded early RNAs (EBERs). EBV was present in the tumors of 11 patients (34%). Sixty nine percent of the children presented with abdominal disease, 19% had bone marrow infiltration and only one child had jaw involvement. There was no statistically significant difference between EBV positive and EBV negative children with regard to age, gender, origin, primary site at presentation, or clinical stage of disease. However, there was a trend for younger age in the children with EBV positive BL with a median age of 4, compared to 7 years in children with EBV negative BL. None of the 7 children of Ashkenazi Jewish origin had EBER positive disease. There was no difference in the treatment outcome between the EBV positive patients (estimated survival at 24 months of 82%) and EBV negative children (estimated survival rate of 71% (p=0.58)). In conclusion, although this is only a small series it seems that childhood BL in Israel has the clinical characteristics of sporadic, non-African type with 34% EBV association and a low incidence of jaw tumors. Our data suggest that Ashkenazi Jewish children with BL are less likely to have EBV positive tumors than other ethnic groups. However, more patients will need to be studied in order to assess the validity of this observation.
