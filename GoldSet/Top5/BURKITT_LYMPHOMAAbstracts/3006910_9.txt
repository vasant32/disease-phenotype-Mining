We report a patient with classical chronic lymphocytic leukemia of IgM kappa phenotype and a stable clinical course, in which repeated chromosome analyses of blood lymphocytes revealed the coexistence of t(14;18), a marker often associated with follicular low grade lymphocytic lymphomas, and t(2;8), a variant of the t(8;14) typically seen in Burkitt's lymphoma. Both these translocations involve immunoglobulin gene regions, the t(2;8) being almost always found in patients with kappa light chain restriction. However, in an EBV-immortalized cell line of this patient, most karyotypes contained t(14;18) alone, without the t(2;8). This suggests that t(14;18) was the primary cytogenetic event, and that t(2;8) evolved subsequently. As a secondary cytogenetic event, the t(2;8) may not share the grave clinical consequences of a primary t(2;8) as seen in Burkitt's lymphoma and related disorders.
