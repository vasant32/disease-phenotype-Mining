In this report, we describe the development of a rapidly progressive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) related cerebral lymphoma in an 11 year old girl, eight months after renal transplantation. No serological evidence for a persistent EBV infection was found, but Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) could be demonstrated in the tumor. The clinical course of our patient was different from EBV-related syndromes in renal transplanted patients described in previous reports. Furthermore, pathological investigations of the biopsy specimen and tumor cells obtained at necropsy revealed a discrepancy in light chain expression. The possibility that lymphoproliferative disorders represent multiclonal B cell lymphomas is discussed.
