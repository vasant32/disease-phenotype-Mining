Newly synthesized interferon and its mRNA were membrane-associated in a human lymphoblastoid cell (Namalwa) that had been induced with Sendai virus. Treatment with zinc, which acts as an inhibitor of proteolytic cleavage, prevented interferon production. When cytoskeletal function was disrupted by adding both colchicine and cytochalasin B to the induced Namalwa cells, secretion of interferon was inhibited. It is concluded that after translation of the interferon mRNA, the newly synthesized interferon polypeptide is discharged into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, and undergoes a proteolytic cleavage before it is secreted by a process involving the cytoskeleton.
