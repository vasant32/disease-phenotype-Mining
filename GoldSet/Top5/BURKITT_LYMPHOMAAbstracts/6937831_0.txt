An interesting and unusual case of undifferentiated lymphoma, Burkitt's type, solely presenting as a submandibular mass in a 24-year-old white American man has been presented. Although surface marker studies were not undertaken, the morphologic and cytologic aspects of the lesion fulfilled the requirements for a diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma. The patient is under chemotherapy and careful follow-up and seems to be clinically free of residual disease.
