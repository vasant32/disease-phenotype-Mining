The complete 5' sequence of the Epstein-Barr virus 3.5-kb latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) mRNA, expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, has been determined. The transcript initiates from heterogeneous start sites within the first terminal repeat (TR) of the viral genome. This region is TATA-less, consistent with heterogeneous starting, but contains multiple GC-rich elements which potentially interact with the Sp1 transcription factor. Expression of the 3.5-kb mRNA was consistently detected in nasopharyngeal carcinoma samples and in additional cell types, including a Burkitt's lymphoma. This is the first identification of an Epstein-Barr virus mRNA containing TR sequence and the first report of the ability of the TR to function as a transcriptional promoter.
