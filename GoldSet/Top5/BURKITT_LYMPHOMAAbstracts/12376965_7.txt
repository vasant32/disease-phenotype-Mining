Deoxyuridine triphosphatase (dUTPase) catalyses the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP and pyrophosphate thus preventing the incorporation of uracil into replicating DNA. Previous studies of several virus models have suggested that viral dUTPases may be required for virus replication in resting cells whereas in proliferating cells cellular dUTPase may substitute for a mutant viral protein. Using monoclonal antibodies and immunohistochemistry, Epstein-Barr virus-associated non-neoplastic and neoplastic diseases were studied for the expression of viral and human dUTPases. Oral hairy leukoplakia, an AIDS-associated lesion of the tongue, is known to support EBV replication in the upper epithelial cell layers. In agreement with this, strong focal expression of EBV dUTPase was detected in the upper epithelial cell layers of oral hairy leukoplakia whereas expression of human dUTPase was confined to the basal proliferative cell compartment. Furthermore, in infectious mononucleosis tonsils, rare scattered small lymphoid cells expressed EBV dUTPase, consistent with the expression pattern of other EBV lytic cycle antigens. These findings are in agreement with the notion that EBV replicates in resting cells. Three EBV-associated tumours, Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lacked detectable expression of EBV dUTPase, in agreement with the notion that EBV infection is largely latent in these tumours. By contrast, expression of human dUTPase was observed regularly in these tumours. These results suggest that EBV dUTPase may be a suitable target for anti-viral therapy and that inhibitors of human dUTPase should prove useful for the treatment of human tumours, including EBV-associated cancers.
