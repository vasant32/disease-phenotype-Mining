We performed cytogenetic analysis in 23 consecutive patients with Burkitt's ALL and 7 patients with Burkitt's lymphoma. Only one patient had a normal karyotype. Twenty-seven patients had a (8;14) translocation and 2 a (2;8) translocation. No (8;22) translocation was seen. In 12 patients (41%), the t(8;14) was the only chromosome rearrangement whereas in the 18 remaining cases (59%), the t(8;14) or t(2;8) was associated with other numerical or structural abnormalities. Chromosomes 1, 7 and 6 were rearranged in 10, 8, and 5 patients, respectively, usually in translocations, duplications, deletions (chromosome 6), or isochromosome of the long arm (chromosomes 1 or 7). The incidence of these additional rearrangements is discussed with regard to previously published reports and the chromosome localization of oncogenes.
