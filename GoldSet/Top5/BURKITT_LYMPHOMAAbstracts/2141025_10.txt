IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta although distantly related at the primary sequence level, bind to the same Mr 80,000 IL-1 receptor on various cell types. Several lines of evidence indicate, however, that the IL-1 receptor on B cells and T cells differ. By binding experiments with 125I-IL-1, marked heterogeneity in IL-1 receptor binding was observed in 13 of 24 B cell lines studied. This was classified into three categories: (I) in nine cell lines, 125I-IL-1 alpha binding revealed high (kD = 10(-10) M) and low affinity (kD = 10(-8) M) IL-1 alpha receptors, whereas 125I-IL-1 beta binding showed one class only with intermediate affinity (kD = 10(-9) M); (II) in three cell lines selective binding with 125I-IL-1 beta was observed; (III) in one cell line only, 125IL-1 alpha and 125I-IL-1 beta bind to a single class of IL-1 receptors as has been described for most cell types. Cross-linking with 125I-IL-1 alpha or 125I-IL-1 beta demonstrated their specific binding to Mr 80,000 and to Mr 68,000 in cell lines in categories I and III, whereas for those in category II, binding to the IL-1 receptor was confined to 125I-IL-1 beta. The expression of two subsets of IL-1 alpha receptors but only one class of IL-1 beta receptors was further confirmed in kinetic studies. Internalization at 37 degrees C demonstrated that only 19% of IL-1 beta was internalized and that binding with IL-1 alpha was entirely cell surface. Flow cytometry studies showed that IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta do not influence B cell surface antigen expression, suggesting that the ability of IL-1 to influence B cell proliferation is not mediated via direct binding to the IL-1 receptor only.
