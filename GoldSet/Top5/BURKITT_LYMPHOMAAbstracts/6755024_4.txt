The effect of host cells on human adenovirus 5 properties was studied with the use of Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (Raji and Jijoye) that poorly replicate the virus. Only a small fraction of the cell population was producing adenovirus 5. The major virus components were synthesized; however, the purified virus particles differed from those produced in HeLa cells by lower density in CsCl gradient, lower content in DNA, limited changes in DNA restriction enzyme pattern, and polypeptide composition. After one passage in HeLa cells, modifications of polypeptides reversed.
