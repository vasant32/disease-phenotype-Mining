A 6-thioguanine-neo-resistant clone, Raji 6-TGR-neoR was fused with pokeweed mitogen-stimulated B cells (PWM-B cells) obtained from a normal healthy donor, and selected by a new selection medium (HAT-neo). Two hybrid clones, HYNI-1 and HYNI-2, were established. These clones expressed surface IgG and HLA class II antigens derived from PWM-B cells, and they had about 20 more chromosomes than Raji 6-TGR-neoR. More significantly, one clone, HYNI-2, expressed interleukin-2 receptor on the cell surface, and generated IgG when stimulated with recombinant interleukin-2. These findings indicate that the HYNI-2 is a good model for studying human B cell differentiation.
