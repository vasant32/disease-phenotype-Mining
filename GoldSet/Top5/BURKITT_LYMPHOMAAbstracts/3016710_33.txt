Sets of Burkitt lymphoma lines and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from the same individuals were compared for sensitivity to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones. Major histocompatibility complex class I antigen-restricted CTL clones were generated by stimulating the lymphocytes of an EBV-seropositive individual with the autologous LCL. One clone (BK-20) lysed the autologous and allogeneic HLA-A11-expressing LCLs but not mitogen-induced B lymphoblasts. Thus the clone was selectively cytotoxic for LCLs. Allospecific CTL clones directed against the HLA-A11 antigen were generated from an EBV-seronegative individual. One clone (WP-36) was selectively cytotoxic for the appropriate allospecific LCL, whereas another clone (WP-21) lysed also T and B lymphoblasts. None of the four Burkitt lymphoma lines established in parallel with the CTL-sensitive LCLs were lysed. Two of the Burkitt lymphoma lines were EBV-negative, and EBV-positive sublines were derived from these by in vitro infection. One but not the other of the two convertants became sensitive to all three types of CTL clones. The CTL-sensitive converted line had also acquired some LCL characteristics: increased cell size, aggregation, and a shift in several of the B-cell-specific surface markers. The CTL-resistant convertant expressed EBV antigens but showed no phenotypic change. These findings suggest that the cellular phenotype plays a decisive role in the sensitivity of B-cell-derived lines to the lytic effect of LCL-selective autologous and allogeneic CTLs.
