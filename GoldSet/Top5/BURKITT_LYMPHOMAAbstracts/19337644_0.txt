Epithelioid cell granulomas are more commonly seen in Hodgkin's disease and T cell lymphomas. Rarely florid granulomatous reaction with necrosis may be a prominent feature in lymphoma. To the best of our knowledge, a total of 11 cases of Burkitt's lymphoma with florid necrotizing granulomas have been reported in the English literature. None of these cases have previously had the stomach involved. Here we report a gastric Burkitt's lymphoma with florid granulomatous reaction diagnosed following a partial gastrectomy. The initial gastric biopsy showed granulomatous gastritis but the radiological and endoscopic appearance was that of a gastric stromal tumour. We conclude that in the presence of a mass lesion, the finding of epithelioid granulomas should warrant re-biopsy to establish an accurate diagnosis and exclude a concurrent malignant process. Hence, major surgery and postoperative complications can be avoided and appropriate treatment regimen can be initiated.
