The p16 protein is a cyclin inhibitor encoded by a gene located in 9p21, which may have antioncogenic properties, and is inactivated by homozygous p16 gene deletion or, less often, point mutation in several types of solid tumors often associated to cytogenetic evidence of 9p21 deletion. We looked for homozygous deletion and point mutation of the p16 gene in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), where 9p21 deletion or rearrangement are also nonrandom cytogenetic findings. Other hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and myeloma were also studied. Homozygous deletion of the p16 gene was seen in 9 of the 63 (14%) ALL analyzed, including 6/39 precursor B-ALL, 3/12 T-ALL, and 0/12 Burkitt's ALL. Three of the 7 ALL with 9p rearrangement (including 3 of the 5 patients where this rearrangement was clearly associated to 9p21 monosomy) had homozygous deletion compared to 5 of the 55 patients with normal 9p (the last patient with homozygous deletion was not successfully karyotyped). Single stranded conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 1 and 2 of the p16 gene was performed in 88 cases of ALL, including the 63 patients analyzed by Southern blot. Twenty-six of the cases had 9p rearrangement, associated to 9p21 monosomy in at least 12 cases. A missense point mutation, at codon 49 (nucleotide 164), was seen in only 1 of the 88 patients. No homozygous deletion and no point mutation of the p16 gene was seen in AML, MDS, CLL, and myeloma. Homozygous deletion of interferon alpha genes (situated close to p16 gene in 9p21) was seen in only 3 of the 9 ALL patients with p16 gene homozygous deletion, and none of the ALL without p16 gene homozygous deletion. Our findings suggest that homozygous deletion of the p16 gene is seen in about 15% of ALL cases, is not restricted to cases with cytogenetically detectable 9p deletion, and could have a pathogenetic role in this malignancy. On the other hand, p16 point mutations are very rare in ALL, and we found no p16 homozygous deletions or mutations in the other hematologic malignancies studied.
