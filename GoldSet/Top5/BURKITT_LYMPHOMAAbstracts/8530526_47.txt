The B cell surface antigen receptor, surface IgM (sIgM), is involved in B cell activation and proliferation. CD40 is involved in regulating IgE production and B cell survival. Cross-linking of B cell sIgM activates the Ras/Raf/p42erk2 pathway. In contrast, ligation of CD40 by antibody or soluble gp39 (CD40 ligand) leads to activation of the c-Jun kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase pathway. JNK/stress-activated protein kinase activation correlated with the stimulation of MEK kinase activity. CD40 does not activate the p42erk2 pathway, and sIgM fails to regulate the JNK/stress-activated protein kinase pathway in B cells. Thus, two important cell surface receptors involved in controlling specific B cell response differentially regulate sequential protein kinase pathways involving different members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. Anti-CD40 also rescued B cell apoptosis induced by anti-IgM. CD40 ligation did not affect the sIgM stimulation of p42erk2 activity. Conversely, sIgM ligation did not influence CD40 stimulation of JNK/stress-activated protein kinase. These results suggest that independent, parallel protein kinase response pathways are involved in the integration of sIgM and CD40 control of B cell phenotype and function.
