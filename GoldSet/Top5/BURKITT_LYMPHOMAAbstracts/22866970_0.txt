 BACKGROUND: In female adolescents and young adults, malignancies of the genital tract are the most frequent type of cancer, closely followed by Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. CASE PRESENTATION: We report an unusual case of sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) presenting with massive bilateral ovarian infiltration, peritoneal carcinomatosis and diffuse nodular lesions of the stomach and the intestine mimicking Krukenberg tumor. Diagnostic biopsies were obtained by endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract. With intensive chemotherapy, complete remission was rapidly achieved, without life-threatening tumor lysis syndrome. CONCLUSION: Besides metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, BL is an important differential diagnosis in adolescents presenting with Krukenberg tumor.
