Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a high-grade, B-cell-originated pediatric malignancy that is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma involving different organs. Mediastinal mass, ascites, peritoneal thickening, and infiltration of the small intestine, kidney, and liver were found in our patient. In this case, we describe the radiologic appearances and possible infiltration patterns of multi-organ BL. Also, we discuss infiltration of the periportal area, such as hypodense lesions in the liver, which is rarely seen in BL.
