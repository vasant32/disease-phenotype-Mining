Burkitt's lymphoma is a highly aggressive type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma frequently associated with extranodal or abdominal manifestations. We report the case of a young woman with generalized Burkitt's lymphoma, initially presenting with signs and symptoms of central nervous system involvement. Myocardial infiltration mimicking hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was detected with electrocardiogram, echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomographic scintigraphy with F-18 desoxy-glucose. These abnormalities resolved after high-intensity chemotherapy with a modified B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) protocol.
