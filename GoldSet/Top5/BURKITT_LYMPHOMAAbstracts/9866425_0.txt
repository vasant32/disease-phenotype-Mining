A 19-year-old man complaining of right upper abdominal pain underwent surgery for the removal of a testicular tumor in October 1997. He was given a diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma and was in clinical stage II B. The patient went into completed remission with VABCOP-M combination chemotherapy, but relapsed with involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). He was treated with ICE, then CHASE together with total cranial irradiation and simultaneous intrathecal MTX and cytosine arabinoside through Ommaya reservoir until a second remission was achieved. Afterward, the patient was given high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation followed by an autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (auto-PBSCT), and maintained complete remission. Though the prognosis for Burkitt's lymphoma with CNS involvement is considered to be poor, high-dose chemotherapy with PBSCT was a successful treatment for relapsed Burkitt's lymphoma in our patient.
