We report a case of Burkitt's lymphoma originating in gluteal muscle tissue. A 61-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital due to painful swelling of the left femur and gluteal region in October 1996. A laboratory examination disclosed elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and soluble interleukin 2 receptor. Gallium scintigraphy demonstrated accumulations in the left femur and gluteal region. Magnetic resonance imaging yielded intense signals and disclosed swelling of muscle tissue in the same region. Pathological examination of biopsy specimens from the left femur revealed a starry-sky pattern, and a chromosomal analysis revealed t(2;8)(p11;q24). Heightened concentrations of antibody for Epstein-Barr virus were not detected. Non-African type Burkitt's lymphoma was diagnosed on the basis of these findings. CHOP therapy and irradiation of the affected region were initially effective, but the disease eventually became resistant to treatment. The patient died of cerebral hemorrhage. As far as we know, this is the first report in Japan of Burkitt's lymphoma originating in muscle tissue.
