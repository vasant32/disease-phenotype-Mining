 CASE HISTORY: A 5-month-old mixed-breed boar presented with lethargy, weakness and anorexia of 1 week's duration. CLINICAL FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS: The boar had an elevated heart rate, slow capillary refill time and cyanotic skin over the ears; it was also severely anaemic. A necropsy revealed scattered petechial haemorrhages, small subcapsular white nodules on the kidneys, a nodule in the parenchyma of one testis, creamy-white bone marrow, a preputial diverticulum, and an ulcer of the pars oesophagea of the stomach. Cytology of peripheral blood and bone marrow identified large numbers of lymphoblasts, which were demonstrated using immunocytochemistry to be of B-cell origin. Histological examination of multiple organs also showed lymphoblastic infiltration. DIAGNOSIS: B-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia with secondary infiltration of lymphoid organs, kidneys, testis and preputial skin. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This is the fi rst known reported case of acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia in swine.
