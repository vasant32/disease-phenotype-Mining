Aggregates of tubular arrays associated with cysternae of endoplasmic reticulum were observed in untreated primary American form Burkitt's lymphoma. The tumor occurred in a white female child who died with severe central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Although the significance of the tubular structures and the mechanism by which they are formed remains unknown, the predilection of these structures for lymphoid and reticuloendothelial cells and their frequent association with either viral or suspected viral conditions cannot be overlooked. However, it is possible that the tubular structures may reflect an increased production of antibody protein in response to a viral antigen.
