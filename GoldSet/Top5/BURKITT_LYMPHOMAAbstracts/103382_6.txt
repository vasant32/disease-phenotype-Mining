Radiographic manifestations of Burkitt's lymphoma in 40 American patients are presented. Pleural effusions were the most common intrathoracic abnormality and were correlated with abdominal ascites more often than with intrathoracic tumor. Tumor involved bone in four patients had intrinsic bowel involvement; nine instances were in the ileum. Intrinsic renal tumor was seen in only two patients. Both ultrasound and computed tomography were useful.
