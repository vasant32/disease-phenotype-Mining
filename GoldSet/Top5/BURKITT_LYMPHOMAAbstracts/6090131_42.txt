We have constructed a cDNA library from the cytoplasmic RNAs of Raji cells, a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line latently infected with Epstein-Barr virus. We report here the characterization of a cDNA representing a spliced RNA transcribed from the IR1-U2 region of the viral genome. The cDNA is 1007 bp long. The 5' region contains three tandem repeats of two exons, 66 and 132 bp, which are transcribed from the IR1 repeats. The 3' region is formed from four exons transcribed from U2. An open reading frame extends from the 5' end to position 784, and includes the repeats. This reading frame presumably corresponds to the carboxy-terminal 261 amino acids of a polypeptide containing several repeats of a 66 amino acid sequence. Since it would be encoded by the IR1-U2 region of the viral genome, the putative polypeptide might be involved in the process of growth-transformation of B-lymphocytes.
