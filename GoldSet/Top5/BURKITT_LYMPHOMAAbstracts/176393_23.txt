Antibody-dependent lymphocyte cytotoxicity (ADLC) was demonstrated against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected RAJI cells with peripheral with peripheral blood lymphocytes from EBV-infected donors. No cytotoxic activity was detected against unifected RAJl cells. The results indicated that this antibody-mediated cytotoxic reaction was directed against the same EBV-induced membrane antigens (MA) previously defined by the membrane immunofluorescence (MF) assay. Antibody to EBV-associated early antigens did not participate in this in vitro reaction. Antibody titers to EBV-induced MA were significantly higher by the ADLC assay in comparison with the MF test. A preliminary study showed no relationship between high antibody titers and the presence of EBV-associated malignancies. The possible in vivo significance of this immune reaction was discussed.
