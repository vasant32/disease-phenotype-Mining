The MDM2 protein regulates the functional activity of the p53 tumor suppressor through direct physical association. Signals that control MDM2 expression are poorly understood but are likely to play an important role in the regulation of p53 activity. We show here that the half-life of MDM2 protein is shorter in proliferating than in quiescent peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We also demonstrate that MDM2 protein half-life is extended in some, but not all, p53 mutant human leukemic cell lines. In at least one of these p53 mutant lines, increased MDM2 protein stability is associated with higher amounts of MDM2 protein. Moreover, we demonstrate that MDM2 protein accumulates to a much greater extent in proteasome inhibitor-treated cells containing unstable MDM2 than in cells possessing stable MDM2. These results demonstrate that MDM2 expression is regulated by events that control the stability of the protein and suggest that the normal regulation of MDM2 turnover can be altered in tumor cell lines.
