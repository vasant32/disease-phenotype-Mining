Nuclear and polyadenylated RNA fractions of Raji cells are encoded by larger fractions of Epstein-Barr virus DNA (35 and 18%, respectively) than encode polyribosomal RNA (10%). Polyribosomal RNA is encoded by DNA mapping at 0.05 X 10(8) to 0.29 X 10(8), 0.63 X 10(8) to 0.66 X 10(8), and 1.10 X 10(8) to 0.03 X 10(8) daltons. An abundant, small (160-base), non-polyadenylated RNA encoded by EcoRI fragment J (0.05 X 10(8) to 0.07 X 10(8) daltons) is also present in the cytoplasm of Raji cells. After induction of early antigen in Raji cells, there was a substantial increase in the complexity of viral polyadenylated and polyribosomal RNAs. Thus, nuclear RNA was encoded by 40% of Epstein-Barr virus DNA, and polyadenylated and polyribosomal RNAs were encoded by at least 30% of Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Polyribosomal RNA from induced Raji cells was encoded by Epstein-Barr virus DNAs mapping at 0.05 X 10(8) to 0.29 X 10(8), 0.63 X 10(8) to 0.66 X 10(8), and 1.10 X 10(8) to 0.03 X 10(8) daltons and also by DNAs mapping within the long unique regions of Epstein-Barr virus DNA at 0.39 X 10(8) to 0.49 X 10(8), 0.51 X 10(8) to 0.59 X 10(8), 0.66 X 10(8) to 0.77 X 10(8), and 1.02 X 10(8) to 1.05 X 10(8) daltons.
