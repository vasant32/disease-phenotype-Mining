The entire Epstein-Barr virus genome is integrated into Burkitt tumor cell DNA at the terminal direct repeat sequence of the virus. There is no homology between the GC-rich (G, guanine; C, cytosine) terminal repeat and the AT-rich (A, adenine; T, thymine) cell sequences with which it has recombined. More than 15 kilobases of cell DNA have been deleted and 236 base pairs are duplicated at one virus-cell junction site.
