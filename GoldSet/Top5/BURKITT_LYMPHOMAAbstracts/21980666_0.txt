 INTRODUCTION: Burkitt's lymphoma belongs to the group of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with B immunophenotypic features of lymphoma cells. It has tendency for extranodal localization primarily in the gastrointestinal tract and retroperitoneum. Primary Burkitt's lymphoma of the stomach is very rare. Stomach is most frequently involved secondarily, growing from intrabdominal tumorous mass into the stomach. CASE OUTLINE: The authors present a 30-year-old male in whom after 6 months duration of temporarily melaenas the diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma was established by endoscopic examination and biopsy of ulceroinfiltrative lesion on the antral part of the stomach. The patient was in clinical stage IIE. After one cycle of chemotherapy according to protocol R-HyperCVAD, a subtotal distal gastrectomy and additional three cycles of the same chemotherapeutic protocol a complete remission was achieved. CONCLUSION: Burkitt's lymphoma is a highly aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma often present in extranodal sites. It should be treated with systemic intensive chemotherapy and surgical removal of tumorous mass when possible. Long-term survival using the combination therapy is possible to achieve in 40-80% of patients.
