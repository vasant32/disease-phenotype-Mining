A monoclonal antibody designated L2 was produced against a late intracellular protein induced by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This protein was expressed in cells producing virus but not in EBV genome-positive nonproducer cell lines, EBV genome-negative cell lines, or producer cultures cultivated in the presence of phosphonoacetic acid as determined by immunofluorescence. In addition, the antibody did not react with the membranes of infected cells indicating that it was not directed against an EBV-induced membrane antigen component. The monoclonal antibody was shown to recognize a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 125K by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This glycoprotein was consistently found to be slightly larger when isolated from the P3HR-1 cell line as opposed to the B-95-8 cell line. A similar difference was also noted by comparison of peptide maps of this protein isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography from the two cell lines. Serological studies indicated that this 125K glycoprotein was a major component of the viral capsid-antigen (VCA) complex as defined by immunofluorescence.
