We describe the radiological findings at presentation and follow up in 24 adult patients with Burkitt's and Burkitt-like lymphoma, age range 17-67 years. This is an older age group than previously described in North American series, but the clinical and imaging characteristics appear similar. Disease confined to the abdomen was seen in 12 (50%) at presentation, of whom 11 had bowel or mesenteric tumours. Of those with bowel involvement, five patients had disease that had arisen in the ileocaecal region. Intra-abdominal disease was large volume (greater than 5 cm) in the majority of patients. Four patients (17%) had small isolated masses in the head and neck region, two (8%) had isolated unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. Six (25%) patients presented with disseminated disease, all with hepatic and/or splenic involvement, intra-abdominal and peripheral lymphadenopathy. Three of these patients with disseminated disease were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. Neurological symptoms were present in a total of five patients at presentation or relapse but positive imaging findings were present in only two patients who had MRI. Computed tomography (CT) head scans performed in four patients were normal. Disease recurrence most commonly occurred within the abdomen.
