The c-myc gene is translocated to one of the immunoglobulin genes in Burkitt's lymphoma resulting in deregulated expression of c-myc. Several enhancers have been shown to be important for expression of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. Four enhancer regions (murine-hypersensitive sites (MHS) 1, 2, 3, and 4) located 3' of the murine immunoglobulin heavy chain gene play a role in activating expression of the translocated c-myc gene. The enhancer regions also result in a shift in transcriptional initiation from the P2 promoter to P1 that is characteristic of the translocated c-myc allele. We found that the most 3' enhancer region (MHS4) activated the c-myc promoter by 46-fold in the Raji Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, and it was the most active enhancer in these cells. The addition of enhancer regions MHS1,2 and 3 to MHS4 increased c-myc transcription by an additional 3-fold and resulted in the full promoter shift from P2 to P1. By deletion analysis of enhancer region MHS4, we located a region that was critical for the transcriptional activity of MHS4. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis revealed that NF-kappaB/Rel family members bound to this region. Mutation of the NF-kappaB binding site abolished both the enhancer activity and the promoter shift activity of MHS4. An active NF-kappaB site was also identified in the human HS4 enhancer. Inhibition of c-myc promoter activity driven by the immunoglobulin enhancers was observed with expression of a super-repressor IkappaBalpha construct. These results indicate that the NF-kappaB/Rel transcription factors play an important role in the deregulation of the translocated c-myc gene in Burkitt's lymphoma and suggest that interference with NF-kappaB function may represent a new approach to the treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma.
