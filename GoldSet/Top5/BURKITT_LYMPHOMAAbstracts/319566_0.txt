Anti-human B lymphocyte serum (AHBS) was obtained by absorbing rabbit anti-human tonsil serum (ATOS) or rabbit anti-human spleen serum (ASPS) with human red cells, liver, neutrophils, thymocytes and glutaraldehyde insolubilized human serum. Specificities of AHBS were checked by the cytotoxicity test, inhibition test of EAC-rosetting and inhibition of PWM responses. Raji cells of Burkitt's lymphoma originating from B-cells and acknowledged as non-immunoglobulin bearing on the cell surface were stained with AHBS according to the immunofluorescent technique. ATOS showed a higher cytotoxic titer against peripheral B-cells and inhibited EAC-rosetting stronger than ASPS did. On the other hand, macrophages in peripheral blood, Kupffer cells in the liver and certain cells of the thymus-medulla were stained with ASPA, but not with ATOS, even after intensively absorbing ASPS with thymocytes.
