The clinical records and histological material from 294 adult Chinese patients with malignant lymphoma were examined. These patients were first seen at the Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, during the 8-year period 1975-82. There were 27 patients (9.2%) with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and 267 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The median age at presentation was younger for HD (45 years) and the male: female ratio was higher (2:1) than the corresponding figures for NHL of 51 years and 1.4:1. In 76 patients (28.5% of NHL), the disease was thought to have originated in an extra-nodal site, 48 of these cases being gastrointestinal lymphomas. It was possible to reclassify 234 NHL according to the Rappaport and Kiel classifications, and the Working Formulation (WF) proposed by the US National Cancer Institute Study; for HD, the Rye classification was used in 26 cases where suitable material was available. Nodular/follicular lymphomas made up 17.1% of nodal NHL and 5.3% of extra-nodal NHL. The "histiocytic" (Rappaport) or large-cell (WF) subtype was the commonest amongst diffuse NHL. There were only four cases of Burkitt's lymphoma. For HD, the nodular sclerosing subtype was commonest in females (5 out of 8 cases) and for males, the commonest was mixed cellularity (10 out of 18 cases). Of patients with nodal NHL 64.7%, presented with Stage IV disease. For HD, there were about equal numbers of patients presenting with Stage II and Stage IV disease (10 and 9 respectively). The low incidence of Hodgkin's disease and of follicular lymphomas is comparable to figures from other "oriental" countries such as Japan.
