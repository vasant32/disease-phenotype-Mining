A 35-year-old Japanese woman in the 24th week of gestation with bilateral breast enlargement was referred to hospital. She was diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma and admitted for detailed evaluation and treatment. Early delivery and subsequent chemotherapy was chosen after considering the gestational week, her general condition and the wishes of the patient and her husband. She gave birth to a male infant by cesarean section in the 25(th) week of gestation. It had been planned to begin high-dose chemotherapy, such as CODOX-M/IVAC, on day 7 of the puerperium; however, her general condition worsened and chemotherapy was therefore begun on day 2 after the birth. Eight hours after chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, vincristine and doxorubicin), she developed cardiac arrest due to tumor lysis syndrome. Despite medical treatment, her bleeding tendency did not improve and she died of respiratory failure with alveolar bleeding five days after chemotherapy.
