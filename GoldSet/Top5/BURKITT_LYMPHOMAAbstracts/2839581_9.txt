We measured the presence of antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 2B (EBNA2B) in patients with AIDS and related disorders, persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, persons at risk for HIV infection, and normal persons. Sera from 38% (16 of 43) of the patients with AIDS and 35% (43 of 123) of HIV-positive individuals reacted with EBNA2B, versus 25% (21 of 83) of the high-risk patients and 7.5% (5 of 65) of the normal persons. Screening these sera against cell lines that express EBNA2B, EBNA2A, or neither antigen revealed that only a proportion of these sera contained EBNA2B-specific antibodies. Many sera reacted with both antigens. Of the EBNA2B-specific sera, 14% (6 of 43) were from patients with AIDS, 16% (20 of 123) from HIV-positive individuals, 5% (4 of 83) from high-risk individuals, and 4.5% (3 of 65) from normal persons. The presence of antibodies to the EBNA2B in HIV-infected individuals indicates that they may be infected with type B strains of EBV.
