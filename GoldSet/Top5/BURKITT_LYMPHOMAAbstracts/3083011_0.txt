Burkitt's lymphoma, characterized by jaw and abdominal tumors, is the most common early childhood malignancy in Central Africa and well-known in the United States, with only sporadic reports coming from other countries. Considered to be the fastest growing tumor in man, it is thought to be of viral etiology with warm, humid climate and malaria regarded as co-factors. This is the first case of Burkitt's lymphoma reported from Greece.
