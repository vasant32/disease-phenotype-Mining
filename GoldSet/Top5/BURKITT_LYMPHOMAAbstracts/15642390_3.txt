Translocations involving chromosome 8 are the most common aberrations in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). The presence of the typical t(8;14)(q24;q32) or its variants has been confirmed in all cases of Burkitt lymphoma (BL), in some cases of Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL), and in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The alterations lead to deregulated expression of c-myc protein by a chromosomal translocation joining C-MYC gene with sequences from immunoglobulin (Ig) enhancers. The C-MYC gene rearrangement plays an essential role in leukemogenesis of BL and probably plays a part in other aggressive NHLs. The present study was undertaken to compare the cytogenetic features in cases of BL, BLL, and DLBCL. We detected chromosomal aberrations by G-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) painting in 10 cases of aggressive B-NHL and used FISH to visualize the C-MYC gene rearrangement. Chromosome 8 was most frequently involved in structural aberrations (8/10 cases), and 4 cases showed the typical t(8;14)(q24;q32). Only two of 5 patients suspected of having BL fulfilled all the criteria for this diagnosis; in the others, chromosome 8 was aberrant, but the absence of C-MYC rearrangement or the results of flow cytometry excluded the diagnosis of BL. All BLL cases showed C-MYC overexpression, but only one had a rearrangement of the C-MYC gene; the remaining cases showed other aberrations of chromosome 8. This study indicates that the mechanisms of C-MYC activation involved in BLL can be different from that for the BL.
