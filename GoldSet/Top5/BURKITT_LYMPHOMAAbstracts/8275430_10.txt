BACKGROUND: Reports on lymphoid malignancy and its treatment in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are limited. METHODS: Antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes or biopsy specimens. Polymerase chain reaction was run using primers for EBV. Reaction products underwent Southern blot analysis to confirm EBV specificity. Tumor clonality was assessed by immunohistochemistry and by Southern blot analysis of immunoglobulin heavy-chain and T-cell receptor beta-gene rearrangement. RESULTS: Within 1 year, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was diagnosed in four children infected with HIV. All four were EBV-seropositive and had detectable EBV DNA in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The EBV-linked disorders lymphoid interstitial pneumonia and recurrent parotid enlargement preceded NHL in three and two of the children, respectively. In all four patients, NHL involved at one time the central nervous system (CNS). All three tested NHL tissues were positive for EBV DNA: A 12-week course of chemotherapy given to two children resulted in rapid tumor regression. One of these children experienced meningeal relapse and died 16 months after diagnosis. The other child, who in addition received local irradiation of the affected eye and who underwent surgical removal of the involved ovaries, has been in continuous remission for 20 months. CONCLUSIONS: EBV-associated NHL may be seen more frequently in pediatric patients with HIV. Treatment protocols taking into account NHL propensity for the CNS in this age group need to be developed.
