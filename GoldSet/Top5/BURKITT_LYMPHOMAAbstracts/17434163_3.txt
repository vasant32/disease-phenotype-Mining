The expression of the myeloid markers CD13, CD33, and CD15 in two hundred and eighty-three cases of de novo childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is examined. The expression of at least one marker is a frequent event which is noted in 64% and 74% of B- and T-lineage ALL cases, respectively. Certain patterns of myeloid antigen expression can be recognized including: no expression of CD13, CD33, and CD15 in mature B-ALL, significantly higher levels of CD13 and CD33 and significantly lower levels of CD15 in TEL-AML1-positive B cell precursor ALL, no expression of CD13 and CD33 in E2A-PBX1-positive B cell precursor ALL cases and common T-ALL (double positive for CD4 and CD8), and no expression of CD13 in MLL-AF4-positive B cell precursor ALL cases. Although the numbers in some ALL subtypes are small, these patterns are consistent with nonrandom expression of myeloid markers in de novo childhood ALL.
