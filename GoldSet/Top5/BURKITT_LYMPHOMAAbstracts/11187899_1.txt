The expression of the surrogate light chain (psiL) - made of the lambda-like (or lambda5) and the VpreB proteins - is a B cell-specific maturation marker. Using an anti-human VpreB mAb (4G7), we recently identified in human normal bone marrows, proB and preB cells that express the psiH-psiL proB (proBCR) and the mu-psiL preB (preBCR) receptors, respectively. In the present study, FACS and biochemical analysis confirm the broad proB and preB reactivity of the 4G7 mAb that contrasts with the narrow specificity of other available anti-psiL reagents for preB cells. This mAb was used to explore intracytoplasmic and cell surface expression of the VpreB protein on a series of 92 precursor B cell ALLs (from 40 child and 52 adult patients), in combination with 24 other mAbs. The major result concerns the identification within proB (or BI) and common (or BII) ALLs, of proBCR and proBCR+ ALLs that express the VpreB in the cytoplasm or at the cell surface, respectively. The percentage of ALLs within these two VpreB sub-groups differ considerably between the ALL origin. In the pediatric series, ALLs present in the majority a proBCR+ phenotype whereas we observed a proBCR+ phenotype for adult ALLs. Based on VpreB expression, and in combination with other published data, we propose a refined classification for precursor B cell ALLs.
