A 16-year-old girl was referred to our hospital complaining of a huge abdominal mass and ascites. Cells from the ascites were morphologically compatible with Burkitt's cells. These cells had surface immunoglobulin (gamma and kappa chain) and were positive for B-cell monoclonal antibody (L21, 24). Small numbers of the same cells were present in the bone marrow. Soon after the beginning of chemotherapy, oliguria, hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia caused by "tumor lysis" developed. Peritoneal dialysis was not effective, and the patient died of acute renal failure. Autopsy revealed no tumor cells in her body.
