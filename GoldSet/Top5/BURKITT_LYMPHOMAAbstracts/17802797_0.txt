AIM: To test feasibility of detection of translocations which are diagnostic for Berkitt's lymphoma with the method of fluorescence in situ hibridization (FISH) on histological sections of paraffin blocks. MATERIAL AND METHODS: FISH on histological sections for detection of t(8;14)(q24;q32) and variant t(2;8)(p12;q24) and t(8;22)(q24;q11) was performed on the material obtained from 53 patients with typical clinical, morphological and immunological picture. DNA probe LSI IgH/MYC, CEP 8 Tri-color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe (Vysis, USA), for variant translocations DNA-probe LSI MYC, Dual color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe (Vysis, USA) were used. RESULTS: Histological material from 31 patients contained translocations characteristic for LB: in 29 (93.5%)--t(8;14)(q24;q32), in 2--variant rearrangements of locus of gene c-myc. Translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32) and its variants were not detected in 22 patients, the diagnosis was changed for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). CONCLUSION: Typical for BL clinical, morphological and immunological picture may present in extra-nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with high proliferative activity. Differential diagnosis between BL and the latter lymphoma is possible only basing on detection of translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32) or its variants. If it is impossible to obtain native material, FISH on histological sections of parasffin blocks is the only possible method of differential diagnosis.
