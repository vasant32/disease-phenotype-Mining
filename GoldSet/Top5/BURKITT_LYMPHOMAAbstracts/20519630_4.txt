The transcription factor KLF4 may act both as an oncogene and a tumor suppressor in a tissue-depending manner. In T- and pre-B-cell lymphoma, KLF4 was found to act as tumor suppressor. We found the KLF4 promoter methylated in B-cell lymphoma cell lines and in primary cases of B-cell lymphomas, namely, follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and in classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) cases. Promoter hypermethylation was associated with silencing of KLF4 expression. Conditional overexpression of KLF4 in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines moderately retarded proliferation, via cell-cycle arrest in G(0)/G(1). In the cHL cell lines, KLF4 induced massive cell death that could partially be inhibited with Z-VAD.fmk. A quantitative reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction array revealed KLF4 target genes, including the proapoptotic gene BAK1. Using an shRNA-mediated knock-down approach, we found that BAK1 is largely responsible for KLF4-induced apoptosis. In addition, we found that KLF4 negatively regulates CXCL10, CD86, and MSC/ABF-1 genes. These genes are specifically up-regulated in HRS cells of cHL and known to be involved in establishing the cHL phenotype. We conclude that epigenetic silencing of KLF4 in B-cell lymphomas and particularly in cHL may favor lymphoma survival by loosening cell-cycle control and protecting from apoptosis.
