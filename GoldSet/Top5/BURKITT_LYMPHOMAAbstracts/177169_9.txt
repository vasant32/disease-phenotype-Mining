A case of intracranial Burkitt's lymphoma is reported in a child whose symptoms began at 3 months of age with a definite histologic diagnosis established at 18 months. Serologic studies demonstrated high antibody titers to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the patient and in four out of five members of the immediate family. The patient also demonstrated immunity to antigens derived from African Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. The autopsy findings strongly support the case for the primary intracranial origin of the neoplasm and a perinatal infection with EBV is probable in this case.
