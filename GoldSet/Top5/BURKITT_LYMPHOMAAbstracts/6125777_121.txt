Four cases of Burkitt's-like lymphoma (undifferentiated, monoclonal, B-cell tumours) in homosexual men were seen in a 9-month period in San Francisco. One tumour contained both Epstein-Barr-virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen. Another tumour contained EBNA, and a third contained no viral antigen, but EBNA and CMV antigens were detected in the overlying epithelium. This outbreak widens the array of neoplasms affecting immunosuppressed homosexual men and provides further evidence of an oncogenic role for EBV and CMV.
