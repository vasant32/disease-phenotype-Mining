Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been associated with serious or fatal lymphoproliferative disease in immunocompromised patients. EBV nuclear protein 2 and latent membrane protein are characteristically expressed in B lymphocytes proliferating in vitro in response to growth transformation by EBV. These two proteins are thought to be effectors of lymphocyte growth since they increase the expression of B-lymphocyte activation (CD23) and cell-adhesion (LFA 3 and ICAM 1) molecules in vitro. Using monoclonal antibody-immune microscopy, we have demonstrated that these two EBV proteins and their associated B-lymphocyte activation or adhesion molecules are expressed in the infiltrating B lymphocytes in immunocompromised patients with EBV lymphoproliferative disease. These monoclonal antibodies should be useful in the early diagnosis of EBV lymphoproliferative disease and in distinguishing it from other B-lymphocyte cancers associated with EBV, such as Burkitt's lymphoma. The finding of EBV nuclear protein 2 and latent membrane protein and their associated activation or adhesion molecules provides a further pathophysiologic link between EBV and the proliferation of B lymphocytes in immunocompromised patients.
