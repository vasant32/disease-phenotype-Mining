The monoclonal antibody 1F5 recognizes human B-cell surface protein CD20 and can activate resting B cells; with this antibody we found CD20 to be a 35/37-kDa non-disulfide-linked protein. The protein has a pI of 7.5-8.0 and is phosphorylated in B-cell lines, tonsillar B cells, and peripheral blood B cells. Both CD20 surface expression and phosphorylation are increased on buoyant tonsillar B cells activated in vivo. Because phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) supports the activation signal initiated by monoclonal antibody 1F5, we studied the effect of PMA on CD20 expression. After brief incubation with mitogenic levels of PMA, the number of dense tonsillar B cells positive for CD20 protein transiently decreased. Paradoxically, the cells remaining positive had more surface CD20 than did control cells, and these remaining surface CD20 molecules were hyperphosphorylated. Furthermore, PMA not only induced phosphorylation of CD20 protein on Raji cells but also increased the internalization of CD20 molecules; both phosphorylation and internalization of CD20 molecules were decreased with the protein kinase C inhibitor palmitoyl carnitine. Conditions that increase CD20 phosphorylation are shown also to increase surface mobility of the molecule, suggesting that CD20 protein internalization may be a critical early event for B-cell entry into the G1 phase of the cell cycle.
