BACKGROUND: It remains unclear whether the presence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma has prognostic implications for patients with primary small intestine lymphoma. METHODS: The clinicopathologic features of 80 patients with primary small intestine lymphoma were examined retrospectively in relation to the presence of MALT lymphoma. Survival was compared univariately and multivariately among the groups divided by clinicopathologic findings. RESULTS: Twenty-one cases (26%) were diagnosed as low grade B-cell lymphoma (15 marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type, 2 mantle cell lymphoma, and 4 follicle center lymphoma), 46 cases (58%) were diagnosed as high grade B-cell lymphoma (19 secondary large cell lymphoma with a low grade MALT component, 17 diffuse large cell lymphoma without MALT features, 7 Burkitt lymphoma, and 3 lymphoblastic lymphoma), and 13 cases (16%) were diagnosed as T-cell lymphoma. A significantly better survival was noted for patients without colorectal and/or gastric involvement, diffuse infiltration under macroscopy, high grade histology, and perforation. Those patients with MALT type tumors, less advanced stage of disease, B-cell phenotype, benign lymphoid follicular hyperplasia, and radical tumor resectability appeared to have a better survival rate. Based on Cox multivariate analysis, early stage disease and MALT-derived tumors were determined to be independent prognostic factors (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of MALT-derived lymphoma appears to have a favorable prognosis among patients with primary small intestinal lymphoma.
