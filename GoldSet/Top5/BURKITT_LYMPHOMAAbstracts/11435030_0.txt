Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been associated with infectious mononucleosis, EBV-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (EBV-AHS), chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV), lymphomas, inflammatory pseudotumor, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. EBV-AHS and CAEBV are more lethal than infectious mononucleosis with imaging findings of gallbladder wall thickening, pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, and hepatomegaly. EBV infection is also associated with benign and malignant tumors.
