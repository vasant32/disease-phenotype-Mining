Activation of lymphocytes with 10 microM ionomycin leads to a rapid increase in the concentration of free cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]i) and, at a slower rate, also to an increase in the cytoplasmic free magnesium concentration ([Mg2+]i). The ionomycin-induced Mg(2+)-mobilization response is dependent on the influx of extracellular Ca2+. After receptor-mediated lymphocyte activation, induced by mitogens or anti-receptor antibodies, a Mg(2+)-mobilization response does occur in a small fraction of the cells. Simultaneous measurement of [Ca2+]i and [Mg2+]i in individual cells showed that the receptor-triggered Mg(2+)-mobilization response is restricted to cells that have a high [Ca2+]i. It can therefore be concluded that a high [Ca2+]i induces the release into the cytoplasm of Mg2+ from intracellular stores.
