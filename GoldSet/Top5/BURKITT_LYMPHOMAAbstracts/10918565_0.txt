A 16-year-old male was evaluated for a 1-month history of alveolar bone resorption, which had been treated with endodontics by a neighborhood dentist. Intraoral examination showed slight gingival swelling and teeth mobility. However, no tumor mass was seen. The panoramic image showed resorption of alveolar bone and loss of teeth lamina dura. Because he complained of general fatigue, he was introduced to the internist. Biopsies of gingiva and bone marrow aspiration revealed a massive proliferation of lymphoblasts expressing CD10, 19, 20 and HLA-DR antigens on the surface. Their karyotypes were abnormal; 46, XY, t (8;14) (q24;q32). Accordingly, he was diagnosed as Burkitt's lymphoma, and received intensive chemotherapy which relieved his symptoms and decreased his tumor. However, his disease soon became refractory to chemotherapy, and he died 11 weeks after the onset.
