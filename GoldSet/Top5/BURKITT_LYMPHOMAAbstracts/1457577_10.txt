During a period of 9 years we used the pediatric BFM-NHL protocol for treatment of 14 adult patients with Burkitt's lymphoma or L3 acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Ten of 14 patients obtained a complete remission including 5/8 with stage-IV disease or B-ALL. After a median follow-up of 55 months none of these ten patients relapsed. The projected survival after 8 years is 71%. Toxicity was moderate, with one early death; a tumor lysis syndrome occurred in four patients. From our experience we conclude that the BFM-NHL protocol is very effective in adult patients, with a high cure rate and acceptable toxicity, even in advanced stages of disease.
