Multi-organ involvement and especially extraintestinal manifestations have suggested an immune complex-mediated pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Using various techniques controversial data have been reported on the incidence and levels of circulating immune complexes and their correlation to clinical presentation. Sera of 131 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (78 Crohn's disease, 53 ulcerative colitis) representing a wide spectrum of disease activity, treatment and presence or absence of extraintestinal manifestations were tested for circulating immune complexes using Raji cell indirect immunofluorescence assay, Raji cell radioimmunoassay, C1q solid phase assay and polyethylene glycol precipitation coupled with measurements of optical density and subsequent immunoelectrophoresis or radial immunodiffusion. Circulating immune complexes in low concentrations were observed in a small number of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, the frequency and concentrations being slightly higher in patients with Crohn's disease than in those with ulcerative colitis. No association of concentrations of circulating immune complexes with disease activity or presence of extraintestinal manifestations could be demonstrated. These data do not support the claim for a major role of circulating immune complexes in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.
