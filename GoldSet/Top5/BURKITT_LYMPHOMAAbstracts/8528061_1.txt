We have examined a series of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) for evidence of expression of the MYC gene family. Northern blot analysis of RNA samples derived from 11 non-malignant reactive lymphoid tissues and 33 NHL was used to investigate expression of MYC, MYCL and MYCN. As expected MYC expression was detected in all samples. The levels of MYC expression were quantified by densitometry and appeared to be 3-8 fold higher in high grade NHL than in the low grade NHL or non-malignant lymphoid tissue. No expression of MYCL was detected in any sample. Expression of MYCN was however observed in one sample, which had been diagnosed as a T-cell high grade NHL. A detailed cytogenetic analysis of this sample proved difficult to obtain but, by using fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), we were able to demonstrate that on one of the chromosomes 2 the MYCN gene was localised to a translocation breakpoint region. It therefore appears that in NHL it is possible for MYCN, like MYC in Burkitt lymphoma, to be activated as a result of a chromosome translocation event.
