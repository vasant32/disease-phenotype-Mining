BACKGROUND: The purpose of this case report is to present severe alveolar bone destruction and gingival enlargement as initial manifestation of Burkitt cell type acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL-L3) in a 14-year-old boy. METHODS: The patient was referred to the periodontology department with a 4-week history of gingival enlargement and loosening of teeth. The clinical examination revealed gingival enlargement and expansion of alveolar mucosa particularly in molar regions of both jaws. Almost all teeth had deep periodontal pockets and severe mobility. While the radiographs showed severe alveolar bone loss which extended to apical thirds of many teeth, the microbiologic analysis revealed that the patient did not harbor major periodontopathogenic bacteria species. The results of blood tests and bone marrow aspiration were compatible with ALL-L3. RESULTS: Remission-induction treatment with BFM-90 ALL chemotherapy protocol was started; however, the patient died 4 weeks after the diagnosis due to neutropenic sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Although no biopsy was performed, it is possible that the severe periodontal destruction and gingival enlargement in this case may have been due to the infiltration of leukemic cells in gingiva, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone. The similarities of these findings with numb chin syndrome (NCS) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) are discussed in this report.
