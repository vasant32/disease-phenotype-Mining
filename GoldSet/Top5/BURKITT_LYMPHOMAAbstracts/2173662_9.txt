Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative Burkitt lymphoma (BL) lines are poor stimulators in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures compared to EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the same individuals. We have previously shown that the stimulatory capacity of the tumor cells is increased after EBV conversion (Avila-Carino et al., Int. J. Cancer 1987. 40: 691). As a first step towards the identification of the viral gene product responsible for this change we have studied the influence of the EBV latent membrane protein (LMP) on the stimulatory capacity of the EBV-negative BL lines BL41 and DG75 and the B lymphoma line BJAB. Four LMP-transfected sublines of BL41, four DG75 LMP transfectants and one LMP-transfected subline of BJAB showed a significantly stronger stimulatory capacity than the original line. The effect was directly proportional to the amount of LMP detected in each transfectant but was not due to reactivation of LMP-specific memory cells since lymphocytes from EBV-seropositive and -seronegative individuals responded equally. In order to define the relation between LMP expression and induction of stimulatory capacity, DG75 was transfected with constructs containing the LMP gene under the control of an heat-shock promoter. The peak of LMP expression in heat shock-treated cells preceded the appearance of stimulatory capacity by 6-12 h suggesting that critical amounts of the protein may be required to induce the phenotypic change recognized by the T cells. LMP influenced in a dose-dependent manner the expression of the adhesion molecules LFA-1, LFA-3 and ICAM-1 and B cell activation markers CD23 and CD39 in transfected sublines of BL41, but did not affect the expression of these markers in the DG75 and BJAB cell line. All LMP-expressing transfectants showed an increased capacity to form conjugates with unprimed allogeneic lymphocytes.
