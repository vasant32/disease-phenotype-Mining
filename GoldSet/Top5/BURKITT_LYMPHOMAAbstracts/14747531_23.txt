LMP1 is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded membrane protein essential for the proliferation of EBV-infected lymphoblasts (E. Kilger, A. Kieser, M. Baumann, and W. Hammerschmidt, EMBO J. 17:1700-1709, 1998). LMP1 also inhibits gene expression and induces cytostasis in transfected cells when it is expressed at levels as little as twofold higher than the average for EBV-positive lymphoblasts (M. Sandberg, A. Kaykas, and B. Sugden, J. Virol. 74:9755-9761, 2000; A. Kaykas and B. Sugden, Oncogene 19:1400-1410, 2000). We have found that in three different clones of EBV-infected lymphoblasts the levels of expression of LMP1 in individual cells in each clone ranged over 100-fold. This difference is due to a difference in levels of the LMP1 transcript. In these clones, cells expressing high levels of LMP1 incorporated less BrdU. We also found that induction of expression of LMP1 or of a derivative of LMP1 with its transmembrane domain fused to green fluorescent protein instead of its carboxy-terminal signaling domain resulted in phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha in EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cells. This induction of phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha was also detected in EBV-infected lymphoblasts, in which high levels of LMP1 correlated with high levels of phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha. Our results indicate that inhibition of gene expression and of cell proliferation by LMP1 occurs normally in EBV-infected cells.
