Specific chromosomal abnormalities are regularly associated with many murine and human malignancies. In particular, the majority of murine plasmacytomas and human Burkitt's lymphomas contain a characteristic translocation which results in the juxtaposition of a cellular oncogene, c-myc, with the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, and this rearranged c-myc directs the synthesis of qualitatively and quantitatively abnormal transcripts which may have an aetiological role in the development of the transformed state in lymphoid malignancies. Similarly, rearrangement and abnormal expression of c-myb (ref. 10) and c-mos (ref. 11) has been reported in other murine lymphoid tumours. Here we describe a novel 6:10 chromosomal translocation in the murine plasmacytoma cell line NS-1 which juxtaposes the immunoglobulin Ck gene with a single-copy sequence of unknown function. The NS-1 plasmacytoma is a frequently used fusion partner in hybridoma production and is known to contain a rearranged c-myc gene and a genetic element which transforms normal mouse fibroblasts in DNA-mediated transfection assays. We conclude that individual B-cell tumours may contain multiple chromosomal translocations perhaps relevant to oncogenesis.
