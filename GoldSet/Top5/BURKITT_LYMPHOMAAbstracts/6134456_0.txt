Serum ferritin was studied in 4 patients with abdominal Burkitt's lymphoma, 6 with facial Burkitt's lymphoma, 10 with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, 6 with secondary hepatic cancer, 8 with primary breast cancer, 4 with Hodgkins's disease, 3 with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and 6 with other neoplastic diseases. Control values were determined for 23 apparently healthy Nigerians. Serum ferritin was significantly elevated in patients with Burkitt's lymphoma (facial and abdominal combined), primary hepatocellular carcinoma, secondary hepatic cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (p less than 0.00001), Hodgkin's disease and in other neoplastic diseases as compared to the control (p less than 0.0004). Serum ferritin levels were significantly elevated (p less than 0.00001) in abdominal Burkitt's lymphoma but less dramatically elevated values or even values within the reference range (mean + 2 Standard Deviations of the controls) were seen in the values of serum ferritin in the patients with facial Burkitt's lymphoma. The assay of serum ferritin may be of some value in the diagnosis and classification of patients with Burkitt's lymphoma, and in monitoring the treatment provided.
