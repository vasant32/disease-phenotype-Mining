Phosphopeptides interacting with src homology 2 (SH2) domains can activate essential signaling enzymes in vitro. When delivered to cells, they may disrupt protein-protein interactions, thereby influencing intracellular signaling. We showed earlier that phosphopeptides corresponding to the inhibitory motif of Fcgamma receptor IIb and a motif of the Grb2-associated binder 1 adaptor protein activate SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 in vitro. To study the ex vivo effects of these peptides, we have now compared different methods for peptide delivery: (i) permeabilization of the target cells and (ii) the use of cell-permeable vectors, which are potentially able to transport biologically active compounds into B cells. We found octanoyl-Arg(8) to be an optimal carrier for the delivery of phosphopeptides to the cells. With this strategy, the function of cell-permeable SHP-2-binding phosphopeptides was analyzed. These peptides modulated the protein phosphorylation in B cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
