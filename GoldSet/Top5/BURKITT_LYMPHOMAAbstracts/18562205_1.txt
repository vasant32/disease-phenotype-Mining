Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is rarely found in the jaw. We present 16 cases and the purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical signs and symptoms. The treatment and the progression evolution are also mentioned. The diagnosis was usually difficult and was often misleading and so delays before the first bone biopsy were frequent. The therapy of this rare, diffuse, large cell lymphoma was very variable from one case to another but the majority of the patients were treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
