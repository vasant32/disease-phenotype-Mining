A 24-year-old man showed recurrent necrotic papulovesicles of the face. The cutaneous lesions started with erythema, followed by vesicles, necrosis, and crusting, and leaving depressed scars. Light avoidance did not prevent the development of the lesions. Histologic examination revealed lymphoproliferative lesions confined to the skin. Latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was detected in the lymphoid cells from the skin lesions by in situ hybridization. A moderate to high dosage of corticosteroids suppressed the development of new skin lesions, but relapses occurred when these systemic corticosteroids were tapered.
