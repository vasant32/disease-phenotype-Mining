Cavernous sinus lymphoma is a rare occurrence. We report a case of a 37-year-old woman who was admitted for an oculo-motor paresis and retro-orbital pain. CT scan and MRI disclosed a cavernous sinus tumor. A surgical biopsy was performed through a pterional approach and the histological diagnosis was a solitary primary Burkitt's lymphoma. Aggressive chemotherapy led to a complete and asymptomatic remission after a follow-up of 9 years. The mechanism of the primary localization in the cavernous sinus is discussed.
