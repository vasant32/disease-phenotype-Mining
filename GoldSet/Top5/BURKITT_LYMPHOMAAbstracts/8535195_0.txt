Because of the aggressive nature and frequent recurrence of malignant lymphomas of the undifferentiated type, we used a multi-drug induction chemotherapy regimen that has met with some success in children with similar type of histopathology followed by intensification and 8 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy in an attempt to prolong the duration of remission and survival in adult patients with this diagnosis. Fifty-one patients (median age 35 years) with undifferentiated malignant lymphoma were collected over a 4 year period (1984-1988) and entered into a phase III protocol done under the auspices of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Six patients who had their diagnosis made at surgery and had resection of their tumor were excluded from analysis of response to therapy. Sixty percent of the patients had Stage IV disease. Sixteen patients had marrow involvement and five had central nervous system (CNS) disease. None of the patients received CNS radiation therapy. The 45 patients evaluated for response showed a response rate of 67% (30/45) and a complete response rate of 40% (18/45). Thirteen responders continue disease-free with a median follow-up of > 40 months and have an estimated 5 year survival of 80%. Only two treatment related deaths were reported for the entire group. Patients with undifferentiated non-Burkitt's lymphoma had a longer survival than those with undifferentiated Burkitt's. We concluded that adult patients with undifferentiated lymphomas could be treated successfully with an aggressive multi-drug chemotherapy regimen, consisting of multiple alternating cycles of non-crossed-resistant chemotherapy. Toxicity with this aggressive prolonged regimen was acceptable.
