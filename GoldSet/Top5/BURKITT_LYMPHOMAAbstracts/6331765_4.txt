The development of Burkitt cell leukemia (FABL3) [1] in a patient 7 years after successful treatment of Hodgkin's disease (HD) by combined modality (chemotherapy and radiotherapy) therapy is described. The B-cell nature of the leukemic blasts is shown by immunologic surface marker studies. While L3 leukemia is very rarely seen following therapy for HD, diffuse lymphoma of small noncleaved cells (LSNC)--resembling the Burkitt tumor--is more common in this setting.
