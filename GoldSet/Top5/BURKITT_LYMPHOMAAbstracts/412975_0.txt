A juvenile male Saimiri sciureus died of a tumor diagnosed as a histiocytic type of malignant lymphoma. The neoplasm presented as a thoracic mass occupying the posterior mediastinum and infiltrating the contiguous structures without involving distant nodes, the liver or spleen. The tumor tissue consisted of sheets or poorly defined clusters of fairly large cells with a vesicular nucleus and a variably abundant cytoplasm. The tumor cells were laid out in a poorly developed stroma of fine argyrophilic fibers. This is the first report of a spontaneous malignant lymphoma in a primate of this species. The speculation is put forth that the reported tumor is probably the first known example of the long sought after correlate of squirrel monkeys to Burkitt lymphoma in man.
