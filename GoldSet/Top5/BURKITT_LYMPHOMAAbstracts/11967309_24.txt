To identify cell proteins regulated by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transcription factor EBNA-2, we analyzed a cell line with conditional EBNA-2 activity by using microarray expression profiling. This led to the identification of two novel target genes induced by EBNA-2. The first of these, interleukin-16, is an immunomodulatory cytokine involved in the regulation of CD4 T cells. The second, AML-2, is a member of the Runt domain family of transcription factors. Quiescent B cells initially expressed AML-1 but, 48 h after virus infection, the levels of AML-1 decreased dramatically, whereas the amount of AML-2 protein increased. Analysis of a panel of B-cell lines indicated that AML-2 expression is normally predominant in EBV latency III, whereas AML-1 is associated with EBV latency I or EBV-negative cells. The AML genes are the first example of cell transcription factors whose expression correlates with the latency I/III phenotype.
