 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recently, the incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is increasing, in which most are aggressive. It is limited for promoting the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy on NHL. In this study, mouse models of B-cell NHL were established for determining the efficacy and mechanisms of novel therapies. METHODS: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma SU-DHL-4 cells and Burkitt's lymphoma Daudi cells were injected into SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice through the tail veins to observe the presentations and requirements for establishing mouse models. The Daudi-cell lymphoma mice were divided into control group and rituximab group, and the latter received treatment of rituximab. The tumor onset and survival time of mice were investigated. RESULTS: The median onset time of SU-DHL-4-cell lymphoma in SCID mice was 39.5 days, which presented cachexia, weight loss, erect hair, tardiness and enlarged tumors in the abdomen, rump or pelvic limb, but without tumor cell infiltration in the liver, spleen or bone marrow. The median onset time of Daudi-cell lymphoma in SCID mice was 30.5 days, which were characterized by paralyzed lower limbs and died about 9.5 days after paralysation. Most organs such as the liver, kidney, spleen and bone marrow were infiltrated by a number of Daudi cells. After treatment of rituximab, Daudi cells presented typical characteristics of apoptosis. The median paralysis time and survival time of mice with Daudi-cell lymphoma were significantly longer in rituximab group than in control group (52.5 days vs. 30.5 days, 76.5 days vs. 40 days, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: SCID mouse models of B-cell lymphoma can be successfully established with either SU-DHL-4 cells or Daudi cells.
