Hybridization of M13 phage DNA to Southern blots of human DNA produces an individual-specific DNA fingerprint. In this study, tumour and lymphocyte DNA from a series of patients with melanoma, Merkel-cell carcinoma, Burkitt's lymphoma and Wilms' tumour was probed with M13 DNA to detect somatic mutations in the DNA of the tumours. Somatic changes were observed in tumour DNA of 16 out of the 28 cases examined. This frequency compared favourably with the frequency with which tumour-specific changes have been found when using the Jeffreys DNA fingerprinting probe 33.15, and demonstrates that M13 DNA provides a useful additional probe for the study of somatic changes in tumours. The finding that multiple DNA fragments were lost or gained in DNA fingerprints from individual tumours indicates a marked degree of complexity in the genetic changes involved in the evolution of certain human cancers.
