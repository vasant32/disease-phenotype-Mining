We paper describe a mass spectrometric approach generally applicable for the rapid identification and characterization of proteins isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The highly sensitive nanoflow-electrospray mass spectrometry employing a quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer was used for the direct identification of proteins from the peptide mixture generated from only one high resolution 2-DE gel without high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation or Edman sequencing. Due to the high sensitivity and high mass accuracy of the instrument employed, this technique proved to be a powerful tool for the identification of proteins from femtomole amounts of materials. We applied the technique for the investigation of Burkitt lymphoma BL60 cell proteins. This cell line has been used as a model to assign apoptosis-associated proteins by subtractive analysis of normal and apoptotic cells. From the nuclear fraction of these cells, 36 protein spots were examined, from only one micropreparative Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 stained gel, after proteolytic digestion by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and nanospray mass spectrometry (MS). In combination with database searches, of 33 proteins were successfully identified by nanospray-MS/MS-sequencing of up to eight peptides per protein. Three proteins were new proteins not listed in any of the available databases. Some of the identified proteins are known to be involved in apoptosis processes, the others were common proteins in the eukaryotic cell. The given technique and the protein data are the basis for construction of a database to compare normal and apoptosis-induced cells and, further, to enable fast screening of drug impact in apoptosis-associated processes.
