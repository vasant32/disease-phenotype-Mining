We report that type I interferons (IFNs) upregulate latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) expression by direct activation of the ED-L1 promoter in several Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-carrying Burkitt's lymphoma lines. In EBV-infected primary B cells, IFN-Î± transiently upregulates LMP-1 mRNA, but not protein levels, followed by downregulation of both, suggesting a novel antiproliferative mechanism of type I IFNs. Furthermore, our results may explain the expression of LMP-1 in memory B cells of systemic lupus erythematosus patients.
