 OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of celecoxib in combination with adriamycin(ADM) on cell proliferation and apoptosis. METHODS: Cell lines were treated with celecoxib,and cell proliferation was examined by the method of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide(MTT) at different time. The cellular apoptotic rate was analyzed by flow cytometry. RT-PCR was applied to distinguish the level of caspase-9 mRNA expression. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the caspase-9 protein expression in Raji cells. RESULTS: Celecoxib inhibited the proliferation and increased the apoptosis of Raji cell lines in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner within 20-100 Î¼mol/L. Compared with the celecoxib alone, the proliferation of Raji cell lines incubated with celecoxib and adriamycin was decreased. Caspase-9 mRNA and protein expression in Raji cells were significantly enhanced after the treatment of celecoxib (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Celecoxib can inhibit the proliferation of Raji cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Celecoxib may lead to the apoptosis of Raji cells by up-regulating activities of caspase-9. Adriamycin could intensify the effect.
