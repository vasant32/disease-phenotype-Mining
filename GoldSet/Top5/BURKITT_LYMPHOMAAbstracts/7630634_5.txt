In the Burkitt lymphoma line Oma-BL1, EBV positive and negative cells coexist. We demonstrate that EBV positive and negative subclones are identical with respect to chromosome markers and HLA type and that the same c-myc rearrangement occurs in all the subclones. This shows that the tumor cells are derived from the same patient and are of monoclonal origin. In the positive subclones, the EBV genome was stably maintained in the episomal form. The EBV negative subclones could be derived from previously uncloned tumor cells in early passage, but not from the EBV positive subclones.
