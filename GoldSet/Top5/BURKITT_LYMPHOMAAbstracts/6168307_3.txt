Serum beta2-microglobulin measurements were made in Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Africans and infectious mononucleosis in Europeans. There was a significant increase of beta2-microglobulin levels in active Burkitt tumour compared to those in remission but young West African children have higher levels than that in Caucasians. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma can be associated with a raised beta2-microglobulin but the distribution is similar to that seen in other head and neck cancers. In 27 cases of infectious mononucleosis 74% have raised levels of serum beta2-microglobulin. The mechanism of production of high serum beta2-microglobulin levels in rural African children is as yet unknown.
