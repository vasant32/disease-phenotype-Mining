Twenty-five cases of malignant lymphoma of the uterine corpus or cervix and the vagina, and one case of granulocytic sarcoma of the cervix were analyzed. The patients typically presented with vaginal bleeding and a subepithelial mass without obvious ulceration or other epithelial abnormality. Twenty-one of the 27 tumors appeared to originate in the cervix, 4 in the vagina, and 2 in the endometrium. Seven of them were nodular lymphomas, 17 diffuse large cell, or "histiocytic" lymphomas, 1 was a Burkitt's tumor, and 2 were granulocytic sarcomas. Sclerosis was a prominent histologic feature in lymphomas of the cervix and vagina. Twenty-one patients had disease confined to a single extranodal site (Ann Arbor Stage IE), and six had lymph node or ovarian involvement (Stages IIE + IV). The overall actuarial 5-year survival was 73%. The survival of patients with Stage IE tumors was 89%, compared with 20% for patients with lymph node or ovarian involvement. None of the 12 patients with Stage IE lymphoma of the cervix or vagina who received definitive initial local treatment (surgical and/or radiation therapy) relapsed. Nodular lymphomas and diffuse lymphomas with a preponderance of large cleaved cells were more often localized and had a better prognosis than large or small noncleaved and immunoblastic types. Lymphoma of the lower female genital tract is a rare, but treatable malignancy, which must be distinguished microscopically from inflammatory lesions and nonlymphoid tumors arising in this site.
