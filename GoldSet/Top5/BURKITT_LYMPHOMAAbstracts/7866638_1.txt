Molecular analyses to determine clonality of T and B cells in malignant lymphoma and leukemia and to detect the (9;22) translocation in chronic myelogenous leukemia are commonly used in clinical molecular biology laboratories. We describe the inclusion of a sensitivity control in each of these assays derived from DNA of well-characterized cell lines. The inclusion of such a sample adds an important quality-control parameter to ensure assay-to-assay reproducibility and to satisfy accreditation and regulatory requirements.
