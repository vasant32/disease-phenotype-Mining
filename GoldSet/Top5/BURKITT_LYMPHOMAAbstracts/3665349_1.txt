An analysis of the plain film changes of the jaws in 51 histologically confirmed cases of Burkitt's lymphoma was carried out. In tumours confined clinically to the jaws there was a 91% incidence of effacement of the dental lamina dura while in tumours confined clinically to the abdomen there was an incidence of 72.7%. When tumour deposits were clinically present in more than one anatomical site, almost all cases showed effacement of the dental lamina dura. These findings emphasise the need for jaw radiographs to reinforce the diagnosis in suspected cases of Burkitt's lymphoma.
