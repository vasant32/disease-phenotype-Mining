Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) negative and EBV carrying Burkitt lymphoma (BL) lines that remain phenotypically similar to the in vivo tumor cells (operationally defined group I BLs) express high levels of CD10 and CD77, and lack immunoblastic markers such as CD23 and CD39, and the cell adhesion molecules CD11a, CD18, CD54 and CD58. This cell phenotype is associated with poor stimulatory capacity in allogeneic mixed lymphocytes cultures (MLC) [Avila-Carino et al. Int. J. Cancer 40, 691-697 (1987)] EBV carrying BL lines tend to drift spontaneously towards an immunoblastic phenotype in parallel with up-regulation of six EBV-encoded nuclear antigens (EBNA-2 to -6) and two membrane proteins (LMP-1 and -2). These viral antigens are characteristically expressed in all EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) of normal B cell origin and can be induced in group I BL lines by treatment with the DNA demethylating agent 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) [Masucci et al. J. Virol. 65, 1558-1567 (1989)]. We have now studied the effect of 5-azaC on the induction of allogenic T cell proliferation by three EBV negative (Ramos, BL28 and BL41) and four EBV carrying BL lines (Rael, Eli, Chep and Mutu) which stably express a group I phenotype. Pre-treatment with 4-15 microM 5-azaC had no effect on the EBV negative cells but increased the stimulatory capacity of all four EBV carrying lines. LMP-1 was the only viral antigen regularly induced suggesting that its expression may be required for the increase of allostimulation. This was corroborated by the observation that LMP-1 transfection increased 35-70-fold the stimulatory capacity of Rael cells. The cell adhesion molecule CD54 was the only cellular marker selectively up-regulated in all cell lines with increased stimulatory capacity.
