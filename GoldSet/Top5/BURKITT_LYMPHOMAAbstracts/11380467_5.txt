A 12-year-old girl presented with a CD33+ precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and seemed to respond well to ALL treatment. However, 2 weeks after diagnosis her leucocyte count rose rapidly with a predominance of myeloid blasts with M5b morphology and CD19+ myeloid immunophenotype. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) treatment was started and remission was achieved after one course of chemotherapy; the AML treatment was continued for 6 months. Two months after cessation of chemotherapy, the patient developed a bone marrow relapse, this time with an undifferentiated blast morphology and a precursor B immunophenotype. Molecular analysis of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes showed several clonal gene rearrangements at diagnosis: two IGH, two IGK and two TCRD gene rearrangements. All rearrangements were also detected during the AML phase of the disease, suggesting a phenotypic shift of the same leukaemia. At relapse, 8 months later, all rearrangements were preserved except for one TCRD (Vdelta2-Ddelta3) rearrangement. The first phenotypic shift in the genotypically stable leukaemia was remarkably fast. The most probable explanation for our observations is an oncogenic event in an undifferentiated haematopoietic progenitor clone, with a highly versatile phenotype.
