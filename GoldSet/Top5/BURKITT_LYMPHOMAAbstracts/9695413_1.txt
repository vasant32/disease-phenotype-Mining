Second malignancy is one of the serious late effects among long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children. Of 83 newly diagnosed pediatric ALL patients at our hospital between January 1980 and December 1995, four patients were found to have second malignancies. These included MDS/AML after B-ALL, rhabdomyosarcoma after early pre-B ALL, ependymoma after B-ALL, and astrocytoma after early pre-B ALL. The mean duration from initial ALL to second malignancy was 5.2 years. The possible causes of second malignancy in these patients are discussed in this report, along with a review of recent literature.
