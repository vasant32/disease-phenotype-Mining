Lymphocytes adhere to cells or extracellular matrices to perform functions relating to cytotoxicity, extravasation and tissue localization, as well as modulation of lymphocyte growth and maturation. This adherence is mainly mediated by 3 families of cell-surface adhesion molecules: integrins, immunoglobulin-related molecules and selectins. Since variations in the degree of adherence may affect the pathophysiology of lymphoproliferative disorders, the expression of a large number of adhesion molecules was analysed on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), and on EBV-positive or EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) lines, by immunofluorescence flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies. With regard to the beta 1, beta 2 and beta 3 integrin subfamilies, LCLs strongly expressed CD49d/CD29 (VLA-4), CD11a/CD18 (Leu-CAMa, LFA-1) and CD51/CD61 (vitronectin receptor). These cells also abundantly expressed CD54 (ICAM-1) and CD58 (LFA-3) as well as the "homing receptors" L-selectin (LECAM-1) and CD44. BL lines had considerably lower amounts of VLA-4 than LCLs, and ICAM-1 was expressed only by some of the tumor lines. All other adhesion molecules were absent or minimally expressed in the BL cells.
