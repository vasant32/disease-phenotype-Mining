We have recently discovered that small antimicrobial β(2,2)-amino acid derivatives (Mw<500) also display activity against cancer cells. To explore their drug potential, we have presently investigated the mechanisms of action of two derivatives BAA-1 (IC(50) 8.1μg/ml) and BAA-2 (IC(50) 3.8μg/ml) on Ramos human Burkitt's lymphoma cells. Studies using annexin-V-FITC/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry revealed essential mechanistic differences, which was confirmed by screening for active caspases, investigation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and electron microscopy studies. Our results indicated that BAA-1 killed Ramos cells by destabilizing the cell membrane, whereas BAA-2 caused apoptosis by the mitochondrial-mediated pathway.
