An 11-yr-old patient was scanned 96 hr after the administration of gallium-67 (67Ga). The scan emulated the biodistribution of a typical bone-seeking radipharmaceutical-rather than that of 67Ga. None of the factors previously identified with alteration of the biodistribution of 67Ga were found. However, the patient had been injected with gadopentetate in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging 4 hr before receiving the 67Ga. Gadolinium appears to cause a strong carrier-like effect in 67Ga scans.
