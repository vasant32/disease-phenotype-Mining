B-lymphoma cells were purged from human bone marrow by incubating the cell suspension with a cocktail of three different pan-B cell mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibodies, and then with immunobeads charged with sheep anti-mouse antibody, followed by magnetic separation. The primary antibodies used, HD37 (CD19), HD6 (CD22), and HH1 (CD37), bind to a very high percentage of the cells in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of poor prognosis. The secondary antibody is directed against the Fc portion of the IgG antibodies. In model experiments Burkitt's lymphoma cells (Rael) were admixed to mononuclear bone marrow cells in the ratio 1/9. With a ratio of immunobeads/total antibody-binding B cells of 50/1 in a first treatment cycle and repeating the procedure with the same number of beads in a second cycle, a tumor cell depletion of more than 5 logs was achieved, as judged by a clonogenic assay. The concomitant reduction of CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM was about 20%. The purging procedure has been scaled up to clinical use. Equipment suitable for purging patients' marrow specimens, employing standard transfusion facilities, is described. With this equipment the efficacy of tumor cell removal was the same as in the model experiments, and the whole magnetic separation could be completed in 2 hours.
