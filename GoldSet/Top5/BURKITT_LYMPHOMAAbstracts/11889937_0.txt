RATIONALE: Burkitt lymphoma (LB), a frequent, very progressive cancer with multiple factors, can be cured. However, the mortality rate remains high in Madagascar. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the epidemiological aspects of LB as well as related socio-economical issues in order to improve successful treatment of the disease. METHODS: Retrospective study of files for children aged under 15 years, hospitalised for LB in the Antananarivo oncology unit from October 1985 to June 2000. The inclusion criteria were anatomo-pathological, clinical and/or X-ray results. Studied parameters included age, sex, ethnic group, medical history, and the distance covered by the child before his/her hospitalisation. FINDINGS: The 77 cases of LB represented 16% of all children aged under 15 years seen in the hospital. The characteristics of the cases corresponded to those of African endemic LB. Most of the children with LB came from areas with endemic malaria, the Eastern and the Centre of Madagascar. All of them belonged to underprivileged families. Early medical advice was sought but distance from services delayed treatment. Various units referred the children, but especially oral surgeons (stomatologists) and ORL physicians. CONCLUSION: A strategy to ensure rapid treatment for children suffering from LB should be developed, from their region of origin up until treatment. This should involve parents as well as all members of the medical staff in charge of these children.
