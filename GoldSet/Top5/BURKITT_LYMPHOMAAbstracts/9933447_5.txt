Phagocyte and NK cell CR3 functions as both an adhesion molecule and an iC3b receptor mediating cytotoxic responses to microorganisms. Cytotoxic activation of iC3b receptor function requires ligation of both a CD11b I-domain site for iC3b and a lectin site located in the C-terminus of CD11b. Because tumours lack the CR3-binding polysaccharides of bacteria and fungi, iC3b-opsonized tumours do not stimulate CR3-dependent cytotoxicity. Previous studies showed that NK cells could be induced to kill iC3b-opsonized tumours with small soluble beta-glucans that bound with high affinity to CR3, bypassing the absence of similar polysaccharides on tumour membranes. Because CR3 signalling requires several tyrosine phosphorylation events, it appeared possible that CR3-dependent killing of autologous tumour cells might be suppressed by NK cell inhibitory receptors for MHC class I (KIR and CD94/NKG2) whose action involves recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatases. In the current study, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cells were used as targets following opsonization with iC3b. Soluble beta-glucan primed CR3 for killing of iC3b-coated B cells, but autologous class I-bearing targets were 84% more resistant than class I-deficient Daudi cells. Blockade of target cell class I with a MoAb specific for a domain recognized by both KIR and CD94/NKG2 resulted in comparable killing of class I+ B cells. By contrast, another MoAb to class II had no effect on cytotoxicity. These data suggest that NK cell recognition of class I suppresses CR3/tyrosine kinase-dependent cytotoxicity in the same way as it suppresses cytotoxicity mediated by other tyrosine kinase-linked receptors such as FcgammaRIIIA (CD16).
