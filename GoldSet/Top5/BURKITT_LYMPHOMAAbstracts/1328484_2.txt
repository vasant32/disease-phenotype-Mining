The Daudi strain of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) possesses a genomic deletion, relative to the B95-8 EBV prototype, that removes the entire Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) open reading frame (ORF) and the sequences encoding the carboxy terminus of EBNA5. Immunoblot analysis carried out in this study indicates that two species of EBNA5 (31K and 37K) are expressed in Daudi cells. Nucleotide sequence analysis of Daudi cDNA clones has confirmed that, as a consequence of the genomic deletion, exons usually appearing further downstream in EBNA messages (exons U or HF) are spliced directly onto the truncated EBNA5 ORF. Furthermore, the use of alternative splicing suggests that the two EBNA5 species expressed in Daudi cells possess different carboxy termini.
