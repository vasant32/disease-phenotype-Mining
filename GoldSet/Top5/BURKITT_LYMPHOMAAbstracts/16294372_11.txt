Many autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) occur much more frequently in women than in men. There is much evidence that oestrogen is the major cause of this gender difference. Interestingly, oestrogen relieves the symptoms of RA and SS but it exacerbates SLE. This contradictory effect of oestrogen on autoimmune diseases is not well understood. Most of the effects of oestrogen are mediated by two receptors: oestrogen receptor alpha and beta (ERalpha and ERbeta). To determine whether these contradictory effects of oestrogen relate to the involvement of distinct effects of the two ERs, we investigated expression of ERalpha and ERbeta in human secondary lymphoid tissues. We observed that, in tonsils, ERbeta is expressed in lymphocytes of germinal centres (GC) and the follicular mantle zone as well as in granulocytes, while ERalpha is expressed only in activated germinal centres but not in the follicular zone. ERbeta is the predominant ER in human leucocytes from peripheral blood, spleen and in leucocytes infiltrating cancers in both males and females. In addition, in different human lymphoma cell lines including Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and multiple myeloma, ERbeta is abundant while ERalpha is not detectable. Our results indicate that ERbeta is the predominant type of ER in mature lymphocytes. We suggest that ERalpha and ERbeta have distinct roles in secondary lymphoid tissues and that further studies with ERbeta-specific agonists will help to elucidate the role of ERbeta in these tissues.
