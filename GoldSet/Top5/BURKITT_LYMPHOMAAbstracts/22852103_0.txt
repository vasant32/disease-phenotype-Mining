We present a case of bilateral ovarian Burkitt's lymphoma is an 18-year old. Diagnosis was made at histology of specimens obtained after an exploratory (diagnostic) laparotomy. Disease was advanced at presentation and complicated with both chylothorax and chylous ascites. Response to chemotherapy though dramatic was short lived. This underscores the need for high index of suspicion amongst clinicians. The availability of affordable less traumatic diagnostic procedures like laparoscopy and computerized tomography scans with facilities for guided biopsies in resource-poor settings can fast track diagnosis and hence treatment.
