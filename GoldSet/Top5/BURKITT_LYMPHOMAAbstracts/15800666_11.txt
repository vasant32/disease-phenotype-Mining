The feasibility and efficacy of up-front high-dose sequential chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in previously untreated adults (median age 33 years; range 15-64) with Burkitt lymphoma (BL), Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LyLy), both without central nervous system or extensive bone marrow involvement was investigated in a multicenter phase II study. Treatment consisted of two sequential high-dose chemotherapy induction courses incorporating prednisone, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide and mitoxantrone, without high-dose methotrexate or high-dose cytarabine. Patients with at least PR went on with BEAM and ASCT. Protocol treatment was completed by 23/27 (85%) BL/BLL and 13/15 (87%) LyLy patients. Median treatment duration until BEAM was 70 (range: 50-116) days. No toxic deaths occurred. Response to treatment was complete response (CR) 81% and partial response (PR) 11% for BL/BLL, CR 73% and PR 20% for LyLy. At a median follow-up of 61 months of patients still alive, six BL/BLL and eight LyLy patients have died. The actuarial 5-year overall and event-free survival estimates are 81 and 73% for BL/BLL vs 46 and 40% for LyLy patients. In conclusion, this short up-front high-dose sequential chemotherapy regimen, followed by ASCT is highly effective in adults with BL/BLL with limited bone marrow involvement, but less so in patients with LyLy.
