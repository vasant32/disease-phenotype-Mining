Drug like aspirin, indomethacin, phenylbutazone, chloroquine and quinine have been reported to induce agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia and leukemia. These drugs are also known to interfere with the prostaglandin system at one point or another. Since prostaglandins are known to be involved in the maturation and differentiation of macrophage-granulocyte progenitor cells, in erythropoietin mediated erythropoiesis and in the functional capabilities of leukocytes, it is proposed here that these haematological abnormalities by these drugs could be due to their affect on the prostaglandin system.
