In our previous study, a Burkitt lymphoma-associated antigen defined by a monoclonal antibody, designated 38.13, was characterized as globotriaosylceramide (Gb3, Gal alpha 1----4 Gal beta 1----4 Glc beta 1----1 Cer) (Nudelman, E., Kannagi, R., Hakomori, S., Parsons, M., Lipinski, M., Wiels, J., Fellous, M., and Tursz, T. (1983) Science (Wash. D.C.) 220, 509-511). Consequently, we have studied the enzymatic basis and organization of Gb3 expression in Burkitt as compared with non-Burkitt lymphoblastoid cell lines. Burkitt lymphoma cell lines (Ramos, Daudi, Put) were characterized by a high chemical quantity of Gb3, high enzyme activity for synthesis of Gb3 (UDP-Gal:LacCer alpha-galactosyltransferase), and a high degree of surface exposure of Gb3, as determined by galactose oxidase/NaB[3H]4 and by cytofluorometry with the monoclonal antibody to Gb3 (38.13). Non-Burkitt lymphoblastoid cell lines (Priess, Remb1, and ARH77) were characterized by the absence of Gb3 at the cell surface detected by cytofluorometry or cell-surface labeling. The cell lines Priess and Remb1 did not contain Gb3 and showed a low alpha-galactosyltransferase activity for Gb3 synthesis. However, the cell line ARH77, though it did not express Gb3 at the cell surface, was found to contain a large chemical quantity of Gb3 and a high level of alpha-galactosyltransferase activity for Gb3 synthesis. However, Gb3 of ARH77 cells was exposed by sialidase treatment, but not by protease treatment, although Gb3 itself was not sialylated. The crypticity of Gb3 in ARH77 cells could be associated with an adjacent sialosyl residue of a second glycoconjugate at the cell surface, in the same way as Gg3 in mouse lymphoma L5178 (Urdal, D. L., and Hakomori, S. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6869-6874). Thus, the expression in Burkitt and non-Burkitt lymphoma is dependent on (i) Gb3 synthesis due to alpha-galactosyltransferase activity and (ii) membrane organization of Gb3, which may be controlled through interaction with the sialosyl residue of a second glycoconjugate.
