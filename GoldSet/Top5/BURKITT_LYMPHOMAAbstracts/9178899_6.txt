Activation of the c-myc proto-oncogene by one of the immunoglobulin (Ig) loci after chromosomal translocation is a consistent feature of Burkitt's lymphoma. Different subtypes of this tumor vary in the molecular architecture of the translocation region. In most cases there are no known regulatory elements of the Ig locus neighboring the oncogene and this considerably obscures the mechanism of its deregulation. In order to assess possible oncogene activation signals, we produced an experimental translocation region by insertion of a c-myc gene about 50 kb from the IgH intron enhancer in a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) containing a 220 kb region of the human Ig heavy chain (IgH) locus. Single copy integration of this YAC into the genome of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells was achieved by spheroplast fusion. Chimeric mice derived from these ES cells developed monoclonal B-cell lymphomas expressing surface IgM by 8-16 weeks of age. The IgH/c-myc translocus showed different V(h)DJ(H) rearrangement in almost all tumors without any alterations of the distance between c-myc and the IgH intron enhancer. This mouse model can be used for the in vivo analysis of c-myc deregulation and the tumor formation capacity of the IgH locus in aberrant rearrangements.
