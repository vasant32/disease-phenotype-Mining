Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), a rapidly growing lymphoma, is recognized by its aggressive course, brief median survival, and low rates of long-term survival for patients. Several polychemotherapeutic approaches are utilized. Twenty adult patients with BL identified according to the Kiel classification were analysed retrospectively. Therapeutic modifications depended upon the different times of the diagnosis. Eight patients received the LSA2-L2 regimen, 11 patients were treated with third generation polychemotherapeutic regimens for high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: F-MACHOP and MACOP-B, and 1 elderly patient was given the COP regimen. Of the 11 patients treated with cyclic conventional therapy (7 with F-MACHOP and 4 with MACOP-B), 8 achieved a complete response (CR). Of the 8 patients who were given the LSA2-L2 protocol, 4 obtained a CR. One elderly patient treated with the COP regimen obtained a partial response. Early stage of disease, low levels of LDH, and the absence of bone marrow involvement were characteristics of patients with good prognoses. Effective conventional third-generation polychemotherapy regimens (F-MACHOP and MACOP-B), normally used for high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, were equally effective for a large fraction of adults with BL. Furthermore, our study confirms the important role of LDH level, stage, and bone marrow involvement as prognostic factors in BL as well as the roles of tumor burden in the CR rate and relapse-free survival.
