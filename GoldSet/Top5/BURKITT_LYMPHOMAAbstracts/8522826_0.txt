Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from four Japanese patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome-positive Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) during remission were exposed to the B95-8 strain of EBV. Maximum concentrations of the EBV-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA) before cellular DNA synthesis were similar to those of healthy counterparts. Subsequently, EBV-immortalised cell lines were established. These immortalised lymphoblastoid cells were treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and superinfected with the P3HR-1 strain of EBV. EBV early antigens (EA) and viral capsid antigen (VCA) were expressed in approximately 3-10 fold higher concentrations by these lymphoblastoid cells than by those from patients with other types of malignant neoplasia including EBV genome-negative BL and from healthy counterparts. Moderate to extremely high IgG antibody titres to EBV VCA as well as IgG antibodies to EA were demonstrated in these patients during the study. These results suggest that defective underlying cellular mechanisms for regulating the replication of EBV may be present in patients with EBV genome-positive BL.
