A comparative analysis of three Epstein-Barr virus DNAs from American patients with infectious mononucleosis (B95-8, Cherry, and Lamont) and four Epstein-Barr virus DNAs from African patients with Burkitt lymphoma (AG876, W91, Raji, and P3HR-1) indicated that the usual format of Epstein-Barr virus DNA includes a variable number of direct repeats of a 0.35 X 10(6)-dalton sequence (TR) at both ends of the DNA, a 9 X 10(6)-dalton sequence of largely unique DNA (Us), a variable number of repeats of a 2 X 10(6)-dalton sequence (IR), and a 89 X 10(6)-dalton sequence of largely unique DNA (UL). Within UL there was homology between DNA at 26 X 10(6) to 28 X 10(6) daltons and DNA at 93 X 10(6) to 95 X 10(6) daltons. The relative sequence order (TR, US, IR, UL, TR) did not vary among "standard" Epstein-Barr virus DNA molecules of each isolate. B95-8 DNA had an unusual deletion extending from 91 X 10(6) to 100 X 10(6) daltons, and P3HR-1 DNA had an unusual deletion extending from 23.5 X 10(6) to 26 X 10(6) daltons. There was sufficient variability among the EcoRI and BamHI fragments of the DNAs to identify each isolate specifically. However, we discerned no distinguishing features for the two geographic or pathogenic origins of the seven isolates. Three intracellular DNAs (Raji, Lamont, and Cherry) and one virion DNA (P3HR-1) were heterogenous in molecular organization and had subpopulations of rearranged or defective molecules. Some regions, particularly 59 X 10(6) to 63 X 10(6) daltons and sequences around TR, frequently participated in rearrangements. Restriction endonuclease maps of the standard and rearranged DNAs of the seven isolates are presented.
