Orbital tumors are more frequent in Africa than in Europe. Children are more often affected than adults. The most frequently observed tumors are the epithelioma of the conjunctiva in adults, and the retinoblastoma and Burkitt's lymphoma in children. Melanoblastomas and lid basal cell carcinomas are fairly rare. Findings from Ethiopia are demonstrated.
