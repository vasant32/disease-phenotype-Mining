The cells of human lymphoblastoid line RPMI-6410t were shown to synthesize constitutively a factor(s) with different types of biological activity. The factor(s) stimulated the growth of both B cells 6410t, obtained from the blood of a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia, and the human embryonic diploid fibroblasts. With B cell lines Raji and P3HR-1.G5, obtained from the patients with Burkitt's lymphoma. The growth factor(s) displayed cytotoxic and cytostatic effects, respectively. Growth-stimulating and cytotoxic activating of the factor were destroyed by a 15 hour exposure to low or high pH. The activity was stable within pH values of 6-8. With regard to heat stability, the activity destroyed at 70 degrees C within 1 hour but remained stable at 56 degrees C during 1 hour. The above factor(s) displayed biological activities similar to those of the previously known tumor necrosis factor (TNF).
