Chromosome 1 long arm abnormalities (translocations, partial of complete trisomies) are non-randomly but inconstantly associated with specific translocations involving chromosomes 8, and 2, 14 or 22 in Burkitt's lymphomas and leukemias. All nine Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines not associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were shown to exhibit a chromosome 1 long arm abnormality and were present in only 3 out of 18 EBV positive cell lines. Bands 1q23 - 1q24 were involved in EBV-negative cell lines. It was thus hypothesised that genetic information resembling that included in viral genome exists on chromosome 1 long arm. This hypothesis implies new possible aspects of relationship between Burkitt's cell line proliferation and EBV.
