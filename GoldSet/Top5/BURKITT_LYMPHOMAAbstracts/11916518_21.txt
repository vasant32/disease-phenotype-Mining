Mutations of transcription factors are associated with the pathogenesis of cancer. Genomic DNA from 381 cancers and cell lines representing leukemias, lymphomas and a variety of solid tumors were examined for mutations of genes coding for the C/EBP-beta, C/EBP-alpha, PU.1, and AML1 transcription factors using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and direct DNA sequencing. Mutation of C/EBP-beta (a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, Kcl22) and C/EBP-delta (a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Raji) were found. Interestingly, the sample with a C/EBP-beta alterations had two missense (P236L and G252A) and two silent mutations in a highly conserved region of the gene. The C/EBP-delta alteration in Raji was a missense mutation (A177G). These findings suggest that mutations of the C/EBP-beta, C/EBP-delta, PU.1, and AML1 rarely contribute to the development of hematopoietic or solid cancers.
