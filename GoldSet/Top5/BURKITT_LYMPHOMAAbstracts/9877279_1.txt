We describe an ALL patient who developed extensive bone marrow necrosis at the time of relapse 2 months after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling. The excruciating and diffuse bone pain, fever and precipitous drop in peripheral blood counts were characteristic. This case illustrates the importance of repeat bone marrow biopsies for the diagnosis of disease relapse and the potential application of MR imaging in the assessment of patients with bone marrow necrosis.
