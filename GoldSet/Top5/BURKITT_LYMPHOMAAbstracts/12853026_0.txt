Burkitt non hodgkin lymphoma affects children and young adults. It is endemic in tropical Africa and it has especially facial and abdominal localisations. We report a case of anal localisation in a 22 years-old man, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), negative aiming to show clinical, therapeutical and evolutive particularities of this exceptional localisation. Only two cases were reported but in HIV positive patients. Perianal abscess was first evoked, but per-operatory findings and histology rectify the diagnosis. Without chemotherapy, the "natural" evolution was rapidly fatal. Despite the efficacy of nowadays protocols, showing 80% of recovery, this observation illustrates the difficulty of malignant affection's management in developing countries caused by diagnostic delay and high cost of chemotherapy.
