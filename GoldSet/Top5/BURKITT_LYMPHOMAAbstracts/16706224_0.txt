Uncontrolled proliferation is one of the main features of tumor cells, and therefore proliferative indices provide prognostic information, which might be valuable for treatment selection. However, in aggressive human lymphoid tumors, an admixture of normal (reactive) cells may be available in all organs infiltrated by neoplastic cells. We have presented data on determining proliferative activity using Ki-67 immunostaining, and demonstrated that an admixture of reactive cells could exert significant influence on the assessments of proliferative indices. We developed an experimental approach, which makes it possible to select neoplastic cells from the overall lymphoid population and to assess their proliferative activity - tumor cell proliferative indices. Tumor cell proferative indices determined in large cell lymphomas might be significantly higher than proliferative indices of overall populations, and the use of tumor cell proliferative indices will result in a more accurate assessment of disease prognosis.
