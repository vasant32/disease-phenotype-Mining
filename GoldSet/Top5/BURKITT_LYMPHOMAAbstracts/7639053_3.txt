We have cloned and characterized the human thymopoietin (TP) coding region and studied the mRNA expression of this gene in different hematopoietic cell lines. The 150-bp PCR fragment that encodes the 49-amino-acid human TP peptide was isolated from genomic placental DNA. Its colinearity with the cDNA sequence suggests lack of introns within the coding region. TP mRNA expression was demonstrated in lymphocytes from all the differentiation stages investigated, as well as in a myeloid cell line (K-562). These findings suggest a further expansion of the proposed TP functions.
