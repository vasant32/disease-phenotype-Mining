Lymphoproliferative diseases that occur in immunocompromised patients are frequently associated with herpesviruses. These patients often fare poorly after treatment with conventional chemotherapy. We reported previously that patients with AIDS-related Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) responded to parenteral azidothymidine (AZT) and IFN-alpha. We found that EBV-positive lymphoma cells derived from these patients cultured with AZT express CD95 and undergo apoptosis. AZT-mediated apoptosis was caspase dependent and occurred despite Fas receptor blockade. In contrast, EBV-negative lymphomas were resistant to AZT-induced apoptosis, as were EBV-positive lymphomas that expressed high levels of bcl-2. Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell lines infected with human herpesvirus type 8 required IFN-alpha to potentiate AZT-induced apoptosis. IFN-alpha did not up-regulate CD95 in BL or PEL but did induce expression of the death receptor ligand, CD95 ligand. AZT-sensitive lymphomas also accumulated significantly higher intracellular AZT monophosphate than did resistant lymphomas. Our data demonstrated distinct apoptotic responses to AZT and IFN-alpha in herpesvirus-associated lymphomas. EBV-positive BL cells that expressed low BCL-2 levels were sensitive to AZT alone; PEL cells required the addition of IFN-alpha to enhance apoptosis, and EBV-negative lymphomas were insensitive to both agents. AZT-sensitive BL cells transfected with BCL-2 became resistant. Susceptibility to antivirus-mediated apoptosis may be exploited to improve the therapy of certain herpesvirus-associated lymphomas.
