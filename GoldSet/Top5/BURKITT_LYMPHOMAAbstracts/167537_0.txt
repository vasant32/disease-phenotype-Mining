Biologically active, 3-H-thymidine-labeled Epstein-Barr virus has been purified by a method, specifically developed for these experiments, and used to infect the human lymphoid cell lines NC37 and Raji. At a late stage of this abortive infection (after 40 hr), 3-H-DNA has been recovered from the nuclei of the infected cells. This DNA has the density and size of free viral DNA. No evidence for integration was observed, in that less than 0,5 viral genome per cell had become covalently bound to cellular DNA. Simultaneously, the viral infection was studied by electron-microscopy.
