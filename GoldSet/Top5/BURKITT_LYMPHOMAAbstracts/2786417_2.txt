The very low expression of insulin receptors in the Burkitt lymphoma cell Raji was increased 2-fold, 6-fold and 10-fold after 1, 2 and 3 days, respectively, by incubation with the differentiation inducer sodium butyrate. Insulin receptor number was increased without a change in receptor affinity, in association with an increase in the receptor alpha and beta subunits detected after cell-surface labelling and immunoprecipitation. Expression of cell-surface class I and II human leukocyte antigens, the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and the CD38 leukocyte antigen was also increased, consistent with B cell differentiation. Butyrate effects were not unspecific, as the binding of tumour necrosis factor and growth hormone and the expression of the B cell markers CD20, B5 and CD21 was not increased. The low expression of insulin receptors on Raji cells is therefore a reflection of the less differentiated state of these cells compared to lymphoblastoid cells.
