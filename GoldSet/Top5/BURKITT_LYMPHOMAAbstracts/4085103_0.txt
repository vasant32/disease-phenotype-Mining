New Guinea and Australia have been joined together during several hundred millions of years. Inhabited by men 40,000 years ago, these populations (papous and aborigenes) have been separated of the others during several millenaries. The first invaders brought with them plasmodiums, Necator americanus, Wuchereria bancrofti and Dengue virus. Brugia malayi, because lack of primates, took non root in New Guinea; the virus of Murray Valley encephalitis is autochthonous; the high frequency of Burkitt lymphoma in New Guinea is, perhaps, a racial feature.
