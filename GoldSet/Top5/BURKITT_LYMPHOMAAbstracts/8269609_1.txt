One of the major complications after high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) infusions is renal damage. We investigated the occurrence of proteinuria after HDMTX administration in children with pediatric malignancies (acute lymphoid leukaemia, osteosarcoma Burkitt's lymphoma). In the period 1989-1990 we gave 52 HDMTX courses to 24 children. During this period, prehydration and extra urinary alkalisation were performed only if the urinary specific gravity was over 1010 or if the urinary pH fell below 7. Using this schedule the mean values obtained for protein extraction were: before the therapy, 0.12 +/- 0.03 g/m2; on day 1 after MTX treatment, 0.38 +/- 0.06 g/m2; and on day 2 after the MTX infusion, 0.39 +/- 0.11 g/m2 (P < 0.01). A significant increase in proteinuria (> 0.2 g/m2 post- vs pretreatment) was detectable in 54% of the patients. In the period 1991-1992 we modified the hydration-alkalisation schedule to include i.v. prehydration for 18-24 h at 3 l/m2/day with a 0.45% NaCl-5% glucose solution along with sodium bicarbonate and posthydration for 72 h with the same solution. On this protocol the mean values determined for the urinary protein content were all in the normal range (pretreatment, 0.03 g/m2/day; day 1, 0.05 g/m2/day; and day 2, 0.08 g/m2/day). These findings were significantly different from the previous results (P < 0.05).
