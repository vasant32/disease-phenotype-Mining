The antitumor activities of immunotoxins (ITs) constructed with deglycosylated ricin A chain (dgA) and either anti-CD19 (HD37) or anti-CD22 (RFB4) monoclonal antibodies were compared in SCID mice with disseminated human Daudi lymphoma (SCID/Daudi). As reported previously, after intravenous injection with Daudi cells, SCID mice develop disseminated lymphoma, which infiltrates the vertebral column and causes paralysis of the hind legs before death. The mean paralysis time (MPT) has been taken as an end point in this tumor model. We have previously reported that early treatment of SCID/Daudi mice with RFB4 coupled to dgA prolongs the MPT in a manner consistent with the killing of 4 logs of tumor cells. In the present study, we show that HD37-dgA kills 2 logs of tumor cells. The lower potency of the HD37-dgA is consistent with its lower IC50 on Daudi cells in vitro. We further show that the antitumor activity of a mixture of HD37-dgA and RFB4-dgA is significantly enhanced in SCID/Daudi mice and is consistent with the killing in excess of 5 logs of tumor cells. However, identical enhancement was observed when a mixture of the RFB4-dgA and the HD37 antibody was administered. In contrast, enhancement was not observed when mice were injected with a mixture of the RFB4 antibody and the HD37-dgA. The results indicate that a "cocktail" of HD37 antibody and RFB4-dgA immunotoxin can have significant antitumor activity in this mouse model of lymphoma and suggest that combinations of particular antibodies and ITs may have cooperative antitumor activity.
