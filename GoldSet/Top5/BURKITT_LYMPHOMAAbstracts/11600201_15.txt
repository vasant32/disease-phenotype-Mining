Interleukin-18 (IL-18) has been found to have multiple effects upon various cells involved in inflammatory response. Recently we reported that B16 murine melanoma cells are able to produce IL-18, which is involved in the regulation of intracellular reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and Fas-ligand expression, indicating that IL-18 plays key role in the tumor activity of melanoma. In this study, we investigated the pattern of IL-18 expression in the human system. IL-18 production was tested by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay in various tumor cell lines, including Raji (Burkitt's lymphoma), IM-9 (B lymphoblast), Jurkat (acute T cell leukemia), SK-MES-1 (squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell line), SK-MEL-2, G-361, DM-4, and DX-3 (melanoma cell lines). ELISA tests showed that IL-18 was highly expressed in malignant skin tumors such as SK-MES-1, SK-MEL-2, G-361, DM-4, and DX-3 cell lines, thus suggesting that IL-18 production may be associated with the malignancy of skin tumors. Here, we report that enhanced IL-18 expression is positively correlated with malignant skin tumors such as SCC and melanoma, suggesting the importance role of IL-18 in malignancy of skin tumors. Taken together, expression of IL-18 by tumor cells in human skin tissue may provide an important clue to understand the pathogenesis of malignant skin tumors.
