Infection of Raji cells with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes suppression of cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis and fragmentation of the cellular DNA. About 1,000 copies of EBV DNA of normal size (about 5 x 10(7) daltons in a single strand, as shown in an alkaline gradient) are synthesized per cell.
