Leukocyte adhesion to cells is mediated by the cell-surface glycoprotein complex CD11a-c/CD18 and, in some cases, the glycoprotein gp84. The process is associated with leukocyte activation and modulates lymphocyte proliferation and maturation. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed normal B lymphocytes give rise to lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) which grow as large clusters mediated by adhesion molecules. In contrast, newly explanted EBV-infected Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells usually grow as single cells or as loose clusters. We now report that EBV positive- and EBV-negative BL lines lack the adhesive protein complex, or have only low levels of it, whereas LCLs, representing various stages of B-lymphocyte development, contain considerably higher amounts, as measured by immunofluorescence flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation. The level of gp84 expression is of the same magnitude in both types of cells.
