Long complete remission in six cases of Burkitt's lymphoma in African children is reported. Complete remissions over eighteen months free of disease are considered as recovery because relapses are rare after this period. These remissions are obtained as well as in stage I and stages III-IV. If classic chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and methotrexate) is effective, aggressive chemotherapy with several antimitotic drugs is recommended in the poor prognosis forms and relapses. Central nervous system chemoprophylaxis, radiation and maintenance chemotherapy are discussed. Prognosis improvement of Burkitt's lymphoma in African children needs early diagnosis and more aggressive treatment with less damage.
