We attempted to determine whether or not Yersinia enterocolitica could invade two cell lines derived from Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), P3HR-1, and Raji cells, and if the expression of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome could be activated by the invasion of the organisms into the cells. The invasiveness of Y. enterocolitica into BL cells was examined morphologically, using transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and the induction of EBV antigens in the BL cells was examined by indirect immunofluorescence. Y. enterocolitica was clearly observed to invade P3HR-1 and Raji cells within 2 hr incubation at 37 degrees, after bacterial challenge. However, the invaded BL cells did not show significant induction of EBV early antigen after cultivation for 72 hr at 37 degrees. Although the present experiment failed to yield positive findings pertaining to the activation of EBV genome, our experimental system per se may still be a useful model when attempting to assess the effects of invading bacteria on the viral genome persistently carried in the host cells.
