The role of surgery in intraabdominal Burkitt's lymphoma remains controversial and different opinions are present in the literature. In our institution, forty patients (30 boys and 10 girls) with intraabdominal Burkitt's lymphoma with ages ranging from 3 to 12 years have been treated and followed from 1989 through 2000. In ten cases, the patients underwent surgery because of their acute abdominal diseases (intestinal obstruction in 5, intussusception in 3, intestinal perforation in one, and acute appendicitis in one). The remaining thirty patients were referred to our clinic because of their abdominal masses, pain, anorexia and fatigue. Twelve children had localized tumors and total resection could be performed. There was one death in this group due to central nervous system involvement during chemotherapy. In the remaining 28 children, extensive intraabdominal diseases were detected. In four of them, debulking procedures were performed, while in 24 children only biopsies could be made; 8 of them underwent a second-look operation. In the debulking procedures group, two children were lost (50 %) due to tumorlysis and acute renal failure. In the biopsy group, there were six deaths (25 %). All patients received chemotherapy after operative recovery. In conclusion, our results suggest that when the tumor is localized, total resection results in a good outcome. However, in the presence of extensive intraabdominal diseases instead of resection, the operation should be limited to biopsy only.
