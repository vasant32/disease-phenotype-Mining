 BACKGROUND: In African settings the treatment results of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) seem to be less favourable compared with Western settings. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyse some factors that affect the treatment of BL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a 16 year period, data were extracted of 80 patients. RESULTS: Complete remission 5%, very good partial response 35%, partial response 16%, no response 10%, data missing 34%. Of all patients, 56% did have a positive response to treatment. However, 51% of this subgroup of patients did not finish treatment. There was no difference in completion of treatment between patients living in Katete district finishing treatment vs. living outside Katete district (respectively 25% vs. 32%, P = 0.7148). CONCLUSION: There is potential for higher cure rates for BL in tropical settings if full effort is put into compliance since a majority of patients, even while having a good prognosis, abandon treatment. Large distance to hospital makes no difference in completing the chemotherapy course.
