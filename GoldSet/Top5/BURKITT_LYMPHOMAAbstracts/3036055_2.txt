The appearance of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated nuclear antigen (EBNA) and induction of EBV-induced early antigen (EA) in human umbilical cord blood lymphocytes (HUCLs) and two EBV genome-negative Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) lines (BJAB and Ramos) were studied by infection with EBVs prepared from three different cell lines: marmoset cell line (B95-8) derived from infections mononucleosis, BL-derived cell line (P3HR-1) and human epithelial hybrid cell line (NPC-KT) derived from nasopharyngeal carcinoma. B95-8 virus can transform HUCLs but cannot superinfect Raji cells. P3HR-1 virus can transform HUCLs cells but cannot transform HUCLs. NPC-KT virus can transform HUCLs and can superinfect Raji cells. We have examined the time sequence of EBNA appearance and EA induction in HUCLs, BJAB cells and Ramos cells, in order to determine if three different strains of EBV differ in their abilities to infect their cells. We found that all three strains of EBV can induce EBNA in HUCLs, BJAB cells and Ramos cells. On the other hand, we found that P3HR-1 virus and NPC-KT virus can induce EA in BJAB cells and Ramos cells, but B95-8 virus cannot induce EA in their cells.
