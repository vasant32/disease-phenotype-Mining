Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a B-lymphotropic virus with a tumorigenic potential. EBV infection has been recognized as the main cause of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Burkitt's lymphoma. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of EBV in squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx. We employed for our analysis a sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for further confirmation of the specificity of the PCR-amplification reaction. Our analysis revealed that 9 of 27 (33%) specimens harbored the EBV genome in the tumor tissue while only 4 (15%) specimens from adjacent normal tissue exhibited evidence of EBV infection. Three were EBV positive for both normal and tumor tissue. No association has been found with disease stage, histological differentiation and nodes at pathology. The relatively high incidence of EBV in the tumor tissue (33%) of patients with laryngeal cancer, as compared to the low (15%) incidence of the virus genome detected in the adjacent normal tissue of the patients, indicates a probable role of EBV in the development of the disease.
