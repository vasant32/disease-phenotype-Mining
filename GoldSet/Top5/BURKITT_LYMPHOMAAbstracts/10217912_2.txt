Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1, also known as hereditary motor sensory neuropathy type 1, is an uncommon autosomal dominant disease that causes destruction of peripheral nerves with a varied clinical course, but often leads to muscle weakness. If the peroneal muscle is involved, the patient may develop a characteristic slapping gait. The dose-limiting side effect of the chemotherapeutic agent vincristine is usually its neurotoxicity. We report the case of a 5-year-old patient with leukemia who developed an acute polyneuropathy after treatment with vincristine. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 was diagnosed in the patient and, subsequently, in his mother only after vincristine toxicity was observed.
