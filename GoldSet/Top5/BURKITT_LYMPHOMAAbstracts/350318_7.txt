The Fc-receptor of normal human leukocytes, of CLL-cells, and of hematopoietic cell lines was demonstrated with soluble peroxidase-anti-peroxidase (PAP) complexes. In about 9% of normal lymphocytes an almost continuous, strong labeling of the cell membrane was established. Some of these lymphocytes were characterized by a peculiar uniform fine structure. The percentage of PAP-labeled monocytes was in the range of 25%, neutrophils nearly 100%, eosinophils 0%, CLL-cells 10%. Labeled portions of the membrane were interiorized from monocytes. The lymphoid cell-line Daudi established from a Burkitt's lymphoma appeared almost negative, the cell line K562 established from a myeloid leukemia in 75% of the cells strongly positive. PAP-labeling was not influenced by preincubation with trypsine or with neuraminidase; it was negative when PAP-F(ab)2 was used. Results of PAP-labeling were not always in agreement with EA-rosettes or with agg-Ig.
