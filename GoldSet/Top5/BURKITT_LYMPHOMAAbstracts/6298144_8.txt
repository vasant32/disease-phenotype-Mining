Immunoprecipitation was used to study Epstein-Barr virus-specific polypeptide synthesis in Raji cells after chemical induction of the viral cycle. The results indicate that Raji cells fail to synthesize a few early and both late polypeptides. Comparison with P3HR-1 virus superinfection experiments at different MOIs indicates that some of these early polypeptides are required for virus DNA replication. The results are compatible with what is known about the complexity of viral DNA in Raji cells.
