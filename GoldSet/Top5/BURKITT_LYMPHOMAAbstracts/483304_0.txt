A 15-year-old Japanese female with complaints of abdominal tumor and exophthalmos underwent surgery. Histologically, the tumor showed a starry-sky pattern with the macrophages interspersed among undifferentiated lymphoblastoid cells. Considering the clinical aspects, distribution of tumor deposits, and cytological findings, the tumor was diagnosed as Burkitt's tumor. The patient expired on the 42nd day of hospitalization due to general dissemination.
