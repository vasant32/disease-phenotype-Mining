A B-cell line was established from the liver of an 11-yr-old boy with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). The cells were morphologically heterogenous, CD10 (CALLA) negative, and expressed several B-cell antigens, including CD23, in a manner reminiscent of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) reported in the literature. However, the cells also showed expression of the CD77 antigen, carried a 14q32+ chromosomal anomaly, and showed IgM-kappa immunoglobulin isotype restriction immediately after their outgrowth in culture. These latter properties are typically associated with Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines rather than LCLs. Aberrant expression of the L60 antigen on these B-cells was found as additional evidence of altered growth regulation in these cells. EBV infection was demonstrated by the abundant expression of EBNA-2 and LMP viral antigens in culture. The cell line described should be useful in planning in vitro experiments designed to understand the factors that modulate the growth of PTLD in vivo.
