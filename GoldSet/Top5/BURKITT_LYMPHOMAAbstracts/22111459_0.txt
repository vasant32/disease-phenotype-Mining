Burkitt's lymphoma is a form of Non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma. We report a case of Burkitt's lymphoma mimicking peritoneal carcinomatosis. We will discuss the imaging and clinical findings that differentiate between peritoneal carcinomatosis and Burkitt's lymphoma. A 26-year-old man presented with nonspecific abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea associated with significant amount of loss of weight. Computed tomography images showed extensive peritoneal and mesenteric mass associated generalized lymphadenopathy. Core biopsy of the mass confirmed Burkitt's lymphoma. CT scan features are helpful indicator to differentiate Burkitt's lymphoma and peritoneal carcinomatosis. Focal or diffuse nodular thickening of the bowel wall with extensive lymphadenopathy are likely to be lymphomatosis over carcinomatosis. However, final and confirmatory diagnosis is histopathology examination.
