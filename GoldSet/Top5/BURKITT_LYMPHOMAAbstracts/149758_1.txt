The DAUDI lymphoblast cell line derived from a patient with Burkitt lymphoma was obtained from two different sources. One of these (DAUDI-I) produced a factor that inhibited lymphocyte proliferation in both human and mouse regardless of the stimulator, i.e. allogeneic lymphocytes or mitogens. Glutaraldehyde treatment eliminated production of the factor and demonstrated that DAUDI-I was capable of stimulating normal lymphocytes in MLR. A second DAUDI cell line (DAUDI-S) did not produce the inhibitory factor and was capable of MLR stimulation.
