Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) was used to identify cellular proteins in T and B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines. Five lines, REH and BALL-1 of B-cell lineage, CCRF-CEM and HPB-ALL of T-cell lineage, and a normal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed line of B-origin (SKLN1) were studied. The lines were immunophenotyped using flow cytometry and lineage associated monoclonal antibodies. Whole cell lysates of the cell lines were subjected to 2-D PAGE analyses. 2-D gels were analyzed with an image scanning computer and the qualitative as well as quantitative differences of the protein patterns were studied. Despite the great similarities in the patterns of the B- and T-gels, three proteins were unique to B-cell lines, while eight were unique to T-cell lines. Using cell lines is the first step toward identifying potential markers in ALL and can provide important information regarding the human ALL databases. Whether these proteins are definite markers for B- or T-ALL or are unique to the cell lines studied needs further exploration.
