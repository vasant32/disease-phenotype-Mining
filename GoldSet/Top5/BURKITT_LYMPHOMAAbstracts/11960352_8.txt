The execution phase of apoptosis occurs through the activation and function of caspases which cleave key substrates that orchestrate the death process. Here, we have compared the sensitivity of various T and B cell lines to death receptor or staurosporine-induced apoptosis. First, we found a lack of correlation between death receptor expression and sensitivity to Fas or Trail. By contrast, a correlation between caspase activation, DNA fragmentation and cell death in T cell lines was evidenced. Among T cells, CEM underwent apoptosis in response to CH11 but were resistant to Trail in agreement with the absence of Trail receptors (DR4 and DR5) on their surface. The B cell line SKW 6.4 was sensitive to CH11 and staurosporine but resistant to Trail. As B cell lines expressed significant levels of DR4 and DR5, resistance to Trail in SKW 6.4 is likely due to the expression of the decoy receptor DcR1. Burkitt's lymphoma such as RPMI 8866 and Raji did not exhibit DNA fragmentation in response to CH11, Trail or staurosporine but showed long-term caspase-dependent loss of viability upon effector treatment. The B cell lines used in this study express very weak or undetectable levels of DFF40 and relatively high levels of DFF45. Interestingly, cytosolic extracts from RPMI 88.66 but not other B lymphoma exhibit altered levels of cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation. Taken together, our results show that: (1) death receptor expression does not correlate with sensitivity to apoptosis; (2) the very low ratio of DFF40 vs. DFF45 is unlikely to explain by itself the lack of DNA fragmentation observed in certain B cell lines; and (3) a defective cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation might account at least in part for the insensitivity of certain Burkitt's lymphoma (RPMI 88.66) to apoptosis. Thus it seems that resistance of Burkitt's lymphoma to apoptosis is not governed by a general mechanism, but is rather multifactorial and differs from one cell line to another.
