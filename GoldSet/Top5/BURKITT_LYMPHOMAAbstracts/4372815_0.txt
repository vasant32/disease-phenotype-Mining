Three continuous lymphoblastoid cell lines, 2 productive of nucleocapsids and 1 nonproductive line, were studied for their content of Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) antigens during transition from stationary to logarithmic phase growth. As a preliminary step, viable cells were separated from degenerating ones in discontinuous gradients of serum albumin. Viral capsid antigens were found in both living and dead cells of the 2 producer lines; however, complement fixing (CF) antigens and nuclear antigen were detected only in viable cell subpopulations. The content of antigen detectable in extracts of viable cells by complement fixation remained constant in replicating and resting cultures; further, all viable cells of the 3 lines demonstrated intranuclear antigen by anticomplement immunofluorescence in all stages of growth. In contrast, the proportion of cells with viral capsid antigen in the producer lines increased 7- to 24-fold following entry of resting populations into the phase of exponential growth.The results suggest that expression of viral capsid antigens is discontinuous and is initiated in response to events in log phase, possibly DNA synthesis or mitosis. Expression of the complement fixing and nuclear antigens in continuous in viable cells. These findings emphasize the intimate relationship of the CF and nuclear antigen to the transformed state and suggest that study of this antigen complex will shed light on the mechanisms of lymphocyte transformation by EBV.
