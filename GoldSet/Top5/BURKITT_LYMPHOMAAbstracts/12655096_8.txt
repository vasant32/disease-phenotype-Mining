Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with lymphoma in immunocompromised patients. This study provides evidence that the expression of EBV nuclear antigen-3 genes can be directed from the F promoter in different type I Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and in some lymphomas from human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. This expression occurs predominantly after induction of the EBV lytic cycle.
