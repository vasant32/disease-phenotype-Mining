An epidemiological study of 66 cases of Burkitt's lymphoma, a census taken between 1980 and 1986 permitted us to ascertain that, in Cameroon, this disease does not only affect children under the age of 15 years, and that the distribution is almost the same in both sexes. Geographically, the littoral and the western region are more affected than the rest of the country. Clinically although the maxillo-facial localisations are not negligible (29.6%), the abdomen involvement is more common (50%; particularly ovary in women). The clinical aspects met are fairly often advanced or generalized cases.
