A 71-year-old Japanese woman who was seropositive for T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) developed primary Burkitt lymphoma of the uterus. CT showed marked enlargement of the uterine body. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in biopsied cells, and most showed the t (8; 14) (q24; q32) translocation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a dual-color stain for IgH/C-MYC fusion showed 99% positively. Biopsies from abdominal operation were diagnosed as Burkitt lymphoma. Treatment was started with intensive chemotherapy according to a protocol for Burkitt lymphoma and mature-B cell leukemia. Two regimens were done with four courses with rituximab. Treatment response was fast, with a documented and lasting first complete remission on CT and laboratory markers after the 4 cycle treatment.
