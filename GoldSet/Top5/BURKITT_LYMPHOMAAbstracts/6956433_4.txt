In four cases, the morphology of neoplastic cells from the peripheral blood and bone marrow suggested the diagnosis of American Burkitt's lymphoma or acute lymphocytic leukemia (French--American--British--Classification; FAB-L3). Cytochemical and immunologic studies, however, indicated that the neoplastic cells in one case were characteristic of acute lymphocytic leukemia (non-B, non-T-cell type); in another case, metastatic carcinoma; and in two two cases acute myelomonocytic leukemia. We conclude that cytochemical and immunologic cell markers are necessary for the diagnosis of American Burkitt's lymphoma. In addition, neoplastic cells simulating lymphoblasts of acute lymphocytic leukemia, FAB-L3 may derive from non-B lymphocytic lineage.
