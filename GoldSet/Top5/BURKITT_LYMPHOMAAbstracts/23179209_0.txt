BACKGROUND: The detection of characteristic genomic aberrations by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has a high diagnostic impact on lymphomas according to the World Health Organization (WHO). To investigate the reproducibility of non-isotopic ISH results a multicenter trial was carried out involving eight institutes for hematopathology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analyses were performed on two diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) without known aberrations, on one follicular lymphoma with a IGH/BCL2 translocation and BCL6 split and on two B-cell lymphomas intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt's lymphoma with c-MYC and BCL2 rearrangements, one with an additional BCL6 split. Break-apart probes for BCL6 and c-MYC, as well as fusion probes for the c-MYC/IGH and the IGH/BCL2 translocations were used. RESULTS: All aberrations were correctly detected by all centres and no false positive or false negative results were obtained. The numbers of positive cells varied from 25% to 94%. Pearson's correlation coefficient between the centres was always >â€‰0.8. CONCLUSIONS: The ISH analysis of recurrent genomic aberrations in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is a highly reproducible technique which yields substantial additive help for lymphoma diagnostics.
