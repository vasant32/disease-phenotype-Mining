Primary Burkitt's lymphoma of the ovary is extremely rare. We report the case of a 39-year-old woman who presented with a 1-month history complaints of night sweats, abdominal pain and dyspnea. Physical examination demonstrated pleural effusions, ascites and an abdominal mass. Imaging showed enlargement of both ovaries extending to the surrounding tissue. Frozen sections on explorative laparotomy suggested granulosa cell tumor of the ovary, and thus extensive debulking was carried out. The final pathological report was compatible with Burkitt's lymphoma. A systematic literature review revealed another 16 cases of ovarian Burkitt's lymphoma. Characteristics predictive for the diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma were: younger age, bilateral ovarian involvement, a rapidly progressive course and high LDH levels.
