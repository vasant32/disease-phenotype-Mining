 OBJECTIVES: In Africa, lymphomas are widely represented by pediatric Burkitt lymphomas. In Abidjan, cytology performed after needle biopsy may be an examination of choice for pediatric lymphomas because of its low cost. We evaluated the value of this cytological examination in comparison with MYC rearrangement assessment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cytological examination was performed after needle biopsy of masses suspected for lymphoma. The reliability of this cytological examination was assessed versus a cytogenetic technique of fluorescence in situ hybridization with a probe targeting locus 8q24 (MYC) which is recurrently rearranged in Burkitt lymphomas. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were enrolled in this study. The median age was 8 years old. The main locations of the suspicious masses were maxillofacial and abdominal. Thirty cytological examinations identified cytological aspects of Burkitt lymphoma. Among these cases, the cytogenetic technique identified 24 cytogenetic rearrangements compatible with a translocation involving MYC as described in Burkitt lymphoma. Six cytological examinations identified cytological aspects of Burkitt lymphoma without MYC translocation. Two cytological examinations were not compatible with Burkitt lymphoma and a normal MYC status was observed. Two cytological examinations were technically not contributive. CONCLUSIONS: The cytological examination showed good performance, notably with excellent sensitivity. The cytological examinations compatible with a Burkitt lymphoma without MYC translocation (6/30=20.0%) could be explained by the absence of translocation involving locus 8q24 (MYC) in some endemic Burkitt lymphomas.
