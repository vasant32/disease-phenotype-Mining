With successful implementation of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (E.P.I.), many Nigerian children are protected against the common infections of childhood which claim their lives within the first decade of existence. Recent observations tend to show that paediatric cancer may start to play a significant role in childhood morbidity and mortality. Therefore, this study analyses 372 cases of paediatric solid malignant tumours received at the Department of Morbid Anatomy, Lagos University Teaching Hospital (L.U.T.H) from 1974 to 1988. Considering all the age groups together, the commonest malignant tumour is lymphoma (32.8%), of which Burkitt's lymphoma accounts for 19.6%. Retinoblastoma and Wilms' tumour represent second and third commonest solid cancers respectively. There is, however, slight variation in the different age groups. For example, in the age group 1-4 years, malignant lymphoma is an uncommon disease representing only 11.0% of all cancers whilst retinoblastoma (34.5%) and nephroblastoma (24.0%) together account for 58.6%. Epithelial cancer although rare in children, represents 12.6% in the 10-14 year age group. There is a higher incidence of this tumour when compared to the other age groups (less than 1 year, 1-4 years and 5-9 years). Intracranial neoplasia are uncommon, representing only 2.0%. The overall incidence of solid malignant tumours in children aged 0-14 years in Lagos is estimated to be 22 per million person years.
