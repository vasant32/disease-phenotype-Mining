Nine cases of Burkitt's type and 5 case of non-Burkitt's type small, non-cleaved cell lymphoma were retrospectively studied to evaluate their clinical and radiological manifestations. In the Burkitt's group, the median age of onset was 9 years old; the male to female ratio was 2:1; and the most frequent presentation was abdominal mass. These features conformed to those of non-endemic (or American) type Burkitt's lymphoma. In comparison with the Burkitt's group, less male-predominance (M:F = 2:3) and cervical mass as the most frequent initial symptom were found in the non-Burkitt's group. Plain films and computed tomographies were collected to evaluate the encroachment of the disease into various organs or compartments. There was a statistically significant correlation in site of the main mass between these two types; the Burkitt's type prefers extranodal, whereas the non-Burkitt's type prefers nodal, involvement. Computed tomographic appearance of Burkitt's lymphoma was also analyzed and summarized by the following five aspects: (1) tumor location-predominantly in the abdomen or head/neck region; (2) tumor density-rather homogeneous and slightly less than that of muscle; (3) tumor margin-often well-localized with distinct contrast to adjacent normal tissue; (4) extranodal predilection- the most frequent pattern of involvement; and (5) bony chang-often mild, despite the size of the mass.
