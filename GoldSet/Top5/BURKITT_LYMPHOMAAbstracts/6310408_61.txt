DNAs of six Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines contained an activated transforming gene detected by transfection of NIH 3T3 cells. This gene was cloned from a recombinant library of Burkitt's lymphoma DNA and identified as a human homologue of chicken Blym-1, the transforming gene detected by transfection of chicken B-cell lymphoma DNA.
