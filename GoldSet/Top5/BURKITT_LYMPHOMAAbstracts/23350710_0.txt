EBV infects more than 90% of the world population. Following primary infection, EBV persists in an asymptomatic latent state. Occasionally, it may switch to lytic infection. Latent EBV infection has been associated with several diseases, such as Burkitt lymphoma (BL). To date, there are no available drugs to target latent EBV and the existing broad spectrum antiviral drugs are mainly active against lytic viral infection. Thus, using computational molecular docking, a virtual screen of a library of small molecules, including xanthones and flavonoids (described with potential for antiviral activity against EBV), was carried out targeting EBV proteins. The more interesting molecules were selected for further computational analysis and subsequently the compounds were tested in the Raji (BL) cell line, to evaluate their activity against latent EBV. The present work identified three novel sulfated small molecules capable of decreasing EBV levels in a Burkitt lymphoma cell line. Therefore, the in silico screening presents a good approach for the development of new anti-EBV agents. Â© 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
