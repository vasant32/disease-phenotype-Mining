Double-hit lymphoma (DHL) is a rare and extremely unfavorable type of lymphoma with concurrent chromosomal translocations of BCL2 and MYC. It is considered that BCL2 translocation precedes MYC events in lymphomagenesis of DHL. In fact, most cases of DHL arise de novo or following FL. We describe a very rare case of DHL arising from Burkitt-like lymphoma according to the revised European-American classification of lymphoid neoplasms. A 67-year-old Japanese male presented with persistent fever. [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed multiple abnormal accumulations in the bone marrow, pancreas, and periphery of the left kidney. The patient was diagnosed with Burkitt-like lymphoma according to a bone marrow biopsy. At the disease onset and the first relapse, chemotherapy was effective and the patient experienced sustained and complete remission. At the second relapse, however, the clinical presentation and morphology of lymphoma cells were nearly identical, but a high level of chemoresistance was acquired, and the patient succumbed almost 1 month after hospitalization. Chromosomal analyses revealed a complex karyotype with concurrent t(14;18) and t(8;22) translocations, which have not been previously detected. It is therefore important to note that DHL cannot be diagnosed without chromosomal analysis. Cytogenetic analyses should thus be performed for patients with high-grade B-cell lymphoma and who experience a recurrence of this lymphoma.
