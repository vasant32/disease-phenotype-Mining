Daudi Burkitt's lymphoma cells activate Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells through TCR ligation by an unknown antigen. This activity is for a large part revealed by their lack of HLA class I antigen expression, allowing their escape from KIR downregulation. We characterize here a culture variant of the Burkitt's lymphoma line Raji, RJ-A3, which is able to promote as efficiently as Daudi cells the outgrowth of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells in cocultures in spite of unchanged HLA class Ia/Ib antigen expression. RJ-A3 is resistant to lysis by most Vgamma9/Vdelta2 lines and clones, even those lacking CD9-4/NKG2 and p58, p70 p140 KIR molecules. However, one Vgamma9/Vdelta2 line which can efficiently kill RJ-A3 do so in a TCR-dependent manner since killing is modulated by anti-TCR antibodies. The CDR3 sequences of the T cell clones amplified with Daudi and RJ-A3 reveal that some clones can be expanded with both lines while others are expanded preferentially with one or the other but not both. This indicates differences in the antigenic determinants of the two Burkitt's lines. The occurrence of this Raji variant line demonstrates that the stimulatory phenotype for Vgamma9/Vdelta2 cells can be acquired by some tumors independently of the loss of class I antigens and comforts the hypothesis of an anti-tumoral function for the Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cell population.
