Persisting DNA of parvovirus H-1 could be demonstrated in cells of two human lymphoma cell lines, the Burkitt lymphoma cell line BL2 and the T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat which survived infection with parvovirus H-1. Persistence of H-1 DNA rendered the cells resistant to a second H-1 infection. This resistance to H-1 superinfection persisted even after loss of H-1 DNA occurring after approximately 150-200 cell generations. Resistance to H-1 superinfection was accompanied by reduced uptake of infectious particles and by a block of H-1 DNA replication. This suggests that persistent H-1 infection leads to modifications of cellular functions involved in the permissivity for H-1.
