Three children with follicular center cell lymphomas are reported. The tumors were studied by light microscopy, electron microscopy, and the immunoperoxidase technique. All three tumors contained monotypic immunoglobulin; one had the morphology of a 'signet ring cell lymphoma,' and one had arisen in a child with Bloom's syndrome. Two tumors exhibited a nodular or partly nodular growth pattern. The tumors were compared with African cases of Burkitt's lymphoma and found to have marked differences in their morphologic and immunohistochemical characteristics. The authors believe that one should distinguish between Burkitt's lymphoma and follicular center cell lymphomas occurring in childhood.
