Two tumors of B lymphocytes, murine plasmacytomas and human Burkitt's lymphoma, display characteristic chromosomal translocations. Molecular cloning studies have shown that these tumors have translocated an oncogene, called C'MYC, into the antibody gene locus. This oncogene translocation probably contributes to but is not sufficient for the occurrence of these tumors.
