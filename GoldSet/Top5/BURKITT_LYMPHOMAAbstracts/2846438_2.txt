Antibodies reactive with the Epstein-Barr (EBV)-encoded latent membrane protein, LMP, were detected in human sera. Membrane fractions of the EBV-carrying Raji cells and a fusion protein (LMFP), that represents the carboxy part of LMP, were used as antigens. These were assayed by the reduction of the leukocyte migration inhibition (LMI) reaction. Reactivity with LMFP was detected in 10 of 14 sera from patients with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and in 3 of 23 sera from healthy EBV-seropositive individuals. The antibody levels were higher in the BL sera. Since the tumor cells do not express LMP, this may be due to the high virus load in the patients.
