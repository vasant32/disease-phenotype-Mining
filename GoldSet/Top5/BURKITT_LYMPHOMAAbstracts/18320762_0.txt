BACKGROUND: Paediatric tumours are seen by the radiotherapist following referral from other specialists. Patients seen by the radiotherapists may not conform to the full spectrum seen in the hospital. OBJECTIVE: To review the pattern of presentation of paediatric malignancies seen at the radiotherapy department of the UCH, Ibadan. METHODS: Retrospective study of all patients below the age of 12 seen in Radiotherapy Department of UCH, Ibadan over a 19-year period was undertaken. Data were collected from the case files and the radiotherapy treatment cards. RESULTS: 244 cases were evaluated with age ranged between 4 months and 12 years. Male to female ratio was 1.15 to 1.0. 23 tumour types were seen with retinoblastoma accounting for about 45% of all the patients reviewed. Burkitt's lymphoma accounted for only about 2.5%. CONCLUSION: Retinoblastoma, nephroblastoma, intracranial malignancies and rhabdomyosarcoma are the tumours most commonly seen at the Radiotherapy Department of the UCH, Ibadan.
