We describe and compare two methods for the determination of magnesium concentration in lymphocytes from cell cultures. The magnesium concentration of lymphocytes was 36 +/- 4 mmol/kg dry weight by atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis and 39 +/- 19 mmol/kg dry weight with electron probe X-ray microanalysis. We found no significant difference between the results for the two methods. The coefficient of variation was 30% for magnesium concentration among individual cells with electron probe X-ray microanalysis.
