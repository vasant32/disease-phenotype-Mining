Blym-1, a transforming gene detected by transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with DNA from Burkitt lymphomas, was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p32) by chromosomal in situ hybridization. The Blym-1 gene was not physically linked to the cellular myc oncogene or to any of the immunoglobulin gene loci implicated in the characteristic chromosomal translocations in Burkitt lymphoma.
