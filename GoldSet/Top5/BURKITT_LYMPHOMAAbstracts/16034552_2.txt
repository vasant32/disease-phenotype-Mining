An inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is an uncommon benign tumor located in various organs that can be misdiagnosed as a malignant neoplasm. We herein present two patients with ileocecal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. An abdominal mass was detected in a 13-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy who presented with paleness, fatigue, intermittent fever, and night sweating. The radiological findings confirmed a mass originating from the ileocecal region. The presumptive diagnosis was Burkitt's lymphoma. The histopathological diagnosis was inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. After a surgical resection, all systemic symptoms rapidly resolved. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is a rare pseudosarcomatous clinical and pathological entity. Although this tumor is more commonly reported in the lung, it can be detected in extrapulmonary sites, including the mesentery. Because the choice of treatment for this tumor is conservative surgery, an accurate preoperative analysis is important to avoid any unnecessary aggressive surgical intervention or other therapeutic approaches.
