The common childhood renal disorders in Nigeria are post-infectious acute glomerulonephritis (PIAGN), nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, congenital anomalies and urinary tract infection. Children with PIAGN often present with hypertension, circulatory overload and hypoalbuminaemia. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by a paucity of minimal change and a poor prognosis. Posterior urethral valves and hydronephrosis are the most frequent congenital anomalies. Children with congenital anomalies present late with advanced disease. The commonest malignancy is nephroblastoma, but Burkitt's lymphoma of the kidney also occurs. Both acute and chronic renal failure present depressing and distressing clinical problems, with an aggressive course and a high morbidity and mortality. Poor socio-economy has adverse effects on the presentation, management and follow-up of Nigerian children with renal disorders.
