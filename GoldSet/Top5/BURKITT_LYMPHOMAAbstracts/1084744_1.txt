The normal human lymphocyte population which exhibits "spontaneous" cytolysis of EB2 Burkitt's lymphoma cells has been characterized. The effector cell has EA and EAC' receptors but lacks E receptors and probably surface Ig. "Spontaneous" anti-EB2 cytotoxicity was not reduced by preincubation of the effector cells with plastic or iron carbonyl or by passage through cotton wool or agarose columns but was reduced by passage through nylon wool columns. Thymocytes were not cytotoxic to EB2 cells, and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells (of B cell characteristics) had reduced cytotoxicity compared with normal lymphocytes. Cells from various lymphoid organs of rats and guinea-pigs were also cytotoxic to EB2 cells with reactivity in spleen greater than or equal to blood greater than lymph nodes. Spleen cells from neonatally thymectomized rats had increased cytotoxicity compared with normal rat spleen cells, suggesting that T lymphocytes are not essential. The effector cell in rat spleen did not adhere to cotton wool or agarose columns, indicating some resemblance to its counterpart in human peripheral blood.
