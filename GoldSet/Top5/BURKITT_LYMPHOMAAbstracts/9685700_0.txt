A search was initiated towards the localization of novel mutated tumour suppressor genes that may be involved in adult leukaemia. For this purpose, we measured the occurrence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in nine patients with acute B-lineage leukaemia (ALL) and one with undifferentiated leukaemia (AUL). Eight leukaemias exhibited a diploid karyotype. For each patient, PCR products of 130 polymorphic microsatellite markers, located in subtelomeric areas of every autosomal chromosome arm were analysed to visualize LOH events resulting from reduplication of a single mutated chromosome or from mitotic recombination. These kinds of LOH events contribute most to LOH in model systems but cannot be detected by classical cytogenetic techniques. By comparing allelic PCR products in tumour cells with those in normal cells, LOH was found in tumour cells of one ALL patient at 9p which harbours the known p16INK4A tumour suppressor gene. In the AUL patient, however, LOH was detected at the telomeres of 4q and 21q, suggesting that these sites may contain novel tumour suppressor genes specifically involved in this form of leukaemia. In the DNA of tumour cells from eight out of 10 patients no LOH was detected. This is in contrast with the general assumption that LOH is a frequent phenomenon in ALL. However, some markers at telomeric regions of chromosomes were already homozygous in the control T-cells of several patients. For instance, we found in the DNA of control cells from one patient five consecutive microsatellites on 9p up to 9p43 which were homozygous and in three other patients homozygosity was observed in band 8q24, which includes the MYC gene. These observations indicate that LOH events already are present in non-cancerous putative stem cells and that mitotic recombination may be a very early event in leukaemogenesis.
