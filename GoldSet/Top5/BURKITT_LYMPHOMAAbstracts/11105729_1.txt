We determined whether there is an association between tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), undernutrition [prealbumin (PA) <160 mg/L, retinol binding protein (RBP) <30 mg/L], disease stage, outcome (death or survival), and race in children with leukemia. TNF-alpha, PA, and RBP were measured in 52 patients (0.8 to 17 years old): 18 African Americans, 34 whites; 27 newly diagnosed (ND), and 25 in clinical remission (CR). Mean levels of TNF-alpha were higher in patients than in 46 healthy children (p < 0.05), but were not different between ND and CR groups. Mean acute phase proteins (APP) were different among groups: ND > CR > controls (p < 0.05). Mean levels of PA and RBP were lower in patients than in controls (p < 0.051, and tended to be higher in CR than in ND patients. African-American patients had lower concentrations of TNF-alpha, PA, and RBP but higher APP than white patients (p < 0.05). CR patients and African-American patients who died tended to have higher levels of TNF-alpha and APP, but lower PA and RBP than those who survived. A higher percentage of ND African Americans (45%) than of ND whites (13%) died. Results suggest that undernutrition and inflammation in CR patients and African Americans were associated with poor survival, and that ND African Americans have a poorer outcome than whites independently of TNF-alpha levels.
