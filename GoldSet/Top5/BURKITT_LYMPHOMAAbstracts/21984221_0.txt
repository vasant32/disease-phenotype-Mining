 PURPOSE: In the last years, the influence of different genes involved in metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents has been studied. Methotrexate (MTX) is a key compound of chemotherapeutic regimens used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and Burkitt's lymphomas (BL). This study aims to evaluate the role of MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and G80A reduced folate carrier gene (RFC1) in a cohort of adult patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies submitted to high-dose MTX followed by leucovorin rescue. METHODS: We performed the analysis of these polymorphisms on genomic DNA with RFLP-PCR. RESULTS: Patients carrying MTHFR A1298C variant showed decreased hepatic and hematological toxicity (P = 0.03). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between homozygous wild-type and variant patients for the RFC1 G(80)A were significantly different (P = 0.035 and P = 0.02, respectively). A significant correlation between hematological toxicity and age (P = 0.003) was observed. There was no significant influence of MTHFR C677T genotype on toxicity, OS and PFS. CONCLUSIONS: Leucovorin rescue given after high-dose MTX probably accounts for the lack of influence of C677T polymorphism. To better define a role of RFC1 polymorphism on patients outcome, it would be worthwhile to perform a study on intracellular MTX level and RFC1 substrate binding affinities in different genotypes.
