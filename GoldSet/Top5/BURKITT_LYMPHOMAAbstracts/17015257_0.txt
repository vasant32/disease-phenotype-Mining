The addition of ferric citrate to Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines inhibits growth, leads to the accumulation of cells in the phase G(2)/M of the cell cycle and to the modulation of translocated c-myc expression. The increase in the labile iron pool (LIP) of iron-treated BL cells leads to cytotoxicity. Indeed, intracellular free iron catalyzes the formation of highly reactive compounds such as hydroxyl radicals and nitric oxide (NO) that damages macromolecular components of cells, eventually resulting in apoptosis. In this report, we have investigated the possible involvement of free radicals in the response of Ramos cells to iron. When added to Ramos cells, iron increased the intracellular levels of peroxide/peroxynitrite and NO. Moreover, the addition of free radicals scavengers (TROLOX and Carboxy-PTIO) neutralized the effects of iron on Ramos cells while addition of an NO donor or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to cells generated effects which partially mimicked those induced by iron addition. Collectively, our results suggest the involvement of free radicals as effectors in the iron specific growth inhibition of BL cells observed in vitro.
