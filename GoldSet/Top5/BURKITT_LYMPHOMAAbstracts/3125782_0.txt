An assay of high sensitivity and specificity for detection of residual malignant cells in remission bone marrow from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has been developed. The assay combines an immunoselection step with immunoglobulin gene rearrangement analysis by high specific-activity DNA probes. In experimental conditions, less than one contaminating tumor cell out of 1000 bone marrow cells was detected. A bone marrow contamination was detected in morphologically negative bone marrow specimens from two intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. This method can be of value in determining a true remission status in high-risk ALL and NHL patients.
