The last fifteen years have provided a significant development in pathomorphological diagnosis of malignant lymphomas (ml), in clinical fellow-up of patients and in its therapy. Diagnosis is built on functional morphological basis (immunohistology). New methods have reslited in identification of new types of mls. On the basis of high number of cases registered in Lymphoma Reference Centre, specific organic distribution new entities can be determined. Perifollicular B-cellular mls of MALT type are frequent in gastrointestinal tract and are rare in Waldeyer ring and in lymph nodes. Flow cytometric determination of DNA content of cells proved to be very useful in diagnostics of mls, so the probably determination of aneuploid and proliferative activity, respectively. These parameters are of prognostic significance. Recirculation of lymphocytes may play a role in dissemination os nHmls. It can be studied in immunomorphological (in vitro) test ased on the interaction (adherence) of lymphocytes and of endothelial cells of high endothelial postcapillary venule. Our observations present that B-cellular CLL and clonal cells of plasma cellular leukemia show endothelial adherence, while multiple cells of myeloma do not.
