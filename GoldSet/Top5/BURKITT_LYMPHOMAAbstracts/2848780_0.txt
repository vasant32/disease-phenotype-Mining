We examined the effect of infection by other herpesviruses on the induction of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens. Raji cells were infected with a variety of viruses before superinfection with P3HR-1 virus 6 h later. Much earlier and greater synthesis of EBV antigens was observed in herpesvirus (herpes simplex virus type 1, type 2 and pseudorabies virus)-infected Raji cells than in mock-infected Raji cells prior to superinfection with P3HR-1 virus, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence tests or immunoprecipitation and PAGE. Although infection with a temperature-sensitive mutant of pseudorabies virus (tsG1) enhanced EBV antigen synthesis as well as wild-type pseudorabies virus at permissive temperature in Raji cells superinfected with P3HR-1 virus, EBV antigen synthesis was strongly inhibited at temperatures nonpermissive for tsG1. These results suggest that a herpesvirus immediate-early protein may play a role in enhancement of EBV antigen expression.
