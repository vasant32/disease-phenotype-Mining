A family with antithrombin III (AT III) deficiency is described. Four brothers or seven siblings show markedly reduced AT III levels (functional assay 39-47%, immunoassay 54-58%). Three developed thromboses and pulmonary embolism at the ages of 11, 17 and 20 years respectively. Longterm oral anticoagulation therapy has been instituted in all four brothers.
