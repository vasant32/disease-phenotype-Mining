We report a patient with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency who was successfully treated with heparin throughout pregnancy. Functional antithrombin III levels fell to 0.32 U/ml during heparin treatment, but it was possible to achieve a heparin effect, measured by the activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin clotting time and heparin assay with subcutaneous heparin in doses of 30,000 U to 35,000 U/24 hours. This achieve an long term heparin effect was obtained without the need for antithrombin III infusions.
