Congenital deficiency of antithrombin III (AT III), a physiological inhibitor of blood coagulation, may lead to increased thromboembolism. Here, we report a case of multiple thromboembolism associated with congenital AT III deficiency. The diagnosis of systemic thromboembolism was made by 111In-labeled platelet scintigraphy (In-scan) which allowed for the daily assessment of thromboemboli size. Thromboemboli were found not only in sites predicted clinically, but also in unexpected sites. In these patients, thus, a careful whole-body examination is necessary for full detection of thromboemboli. In-scan may be a useful technique for such screening.
