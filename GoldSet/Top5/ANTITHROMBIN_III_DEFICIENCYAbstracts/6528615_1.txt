Disturbances of the mechanism of coagulation are relatively frequent causes of thromboembolic disease, especially a diminution in activity of antithrombin III, a decrease in fibrinolytic potential and an increase in platelet functions. These activities were assayed in 512 patients who were in remission after thromboembolic events. Alterations of the clotting system reflecting hypercoagulability were detected in 40% of the patients investigated after venous thrombosis and in 61% to 89% of the patients after arterial thromboembolic events.
