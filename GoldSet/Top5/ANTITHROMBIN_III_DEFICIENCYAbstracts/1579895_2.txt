Pregnant patients with antithrombin III (AT III) deficiency have an unacceptably high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Antithrombotic therapy is therefore recommended. The reported clinical experience of such prophylaxis is limited. Some authors have recommended the use of AT III concentrate in addition to heparin in the management of these patients. We report successful management with heparin alone during pregnancy and the postpartum period in two patients with AT III deficiency. Both patients had experienced VTE during a prior pregnancy; one also experienced VTE during the reported pregnancy. Both patients were therefore at particularly high risk of further VTE. Based on the good results in these two patients, and a review of previously reported cases, we propose that heparin alone, in a dose to maintain the APTT in a therapeutic range, provides adequate prophylaxis and treatment for VTE during pregnancy and delivery in many AT III deficient subjects.
