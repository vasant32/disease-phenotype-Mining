Antithrombin III (AT III) is an inhibitor of serine protease (serpin) comprising 432 amino acids. Quantitative AT III deficiencies are associated with a high risk of thrombotic disease. Although this risk is smaller in patients with qualitative AT III deficiencies, the molecular defects characterizing the latter have been the subject of many studies. However, in quantitative AT III deficiencies, only three mutations have been described: Pro 407 to Leu and A1a404 to Thr (both located in the C-terminal part of the AT III molecule) and also a frameshift in exon IIIa. Using the asymmetric polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genomic DNA analysis by direct sequencing, we detected two mutations in three unrelated families: (i) a C----T transition in exon IIIa in two families, leading to the replacement of the codon corresponding to Arg 129 by a stop codon, and (ii) in the third family, insertion of an adenine in the codon corresponding to Phe 408, a highly conserved serpin amino acid. This insertion altered the reading frame and led to the appearance of a premature stop signal. Patients of all three families were heterozygous for their abnormality. These results show that asymmetric PCR and genomic DNA analysis by direct sequencing permit fast identification of the molecular basis of quantitative AT III deficiencies. It is concluded that in many cases the absence of AT III gene product probably results from point mutation, as previously observed for another serpin, alpha-1-antitrypsin.
