Inherited hypercoagulable states such as protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III deficiencies account for 15% to 20% of recurrent thromboembolic episodes. A common risk profile is associated with these disorders and guides the use of laboratory screening. The use of anticoagulants in inherited hypercoagulable states varies with a patient's personal and familial history of thrombosis. Special consideration is given to the need for anticoagulants perioperatively and during pregnancy.
