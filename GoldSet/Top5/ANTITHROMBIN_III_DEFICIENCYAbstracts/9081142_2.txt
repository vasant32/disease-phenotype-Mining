Thrombotic phenomena are well-recognized complications of nephrotic syndrome attributable to loss of intermediate-sized antithrombotic proteins in the urine, resulting in a hypercoaguable state. As such, nephrotic syndrome may be associated with a reduction in circulating antithrombin III and free protein S levels. Associated spontaneous thrombotic complications are generally venous in nature, with arterial thrombosis occurring less frequently. Hypercoagulability caused by acquired nephrotic syndrome has not generally been recognized as a cause of acute thrombosis of arterial bypass grafts. We report two patients who after having nephrotic syndrome sustained acute thrombosis of their arterial bypass grafts. Pathogenesis and management are discussed.
