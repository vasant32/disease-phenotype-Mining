We describe a 43-year-old male patient with congenital antithrombin III deficiency requiring hemodialysis due to extension of venous thrombus from recurrent deep vein thrombosis. During dialysis with adequate heparinization, the patient often revealed clot formation in the extracorporeal circuit resulting in unexpected discontinuation of dialysis. When either a combination of antithrombin III concentrate + heparin or the newly developed synthetic antithrombin preparation, MD805, was administered during dialysis, he could be uneventfully dialyzed with either of the two regimens.
