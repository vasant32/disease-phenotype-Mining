This is a case report on a course of gemini-pregnancy complicated by gestosis, recurrent submassive pulmonary embolism and discordant growth of the hypotrophic twins. It is concluded from this report that: 1. the AT-III-deficiency in gestosis can be caused by loss and consumption; 2. due to decrease below a critical AT-III-level the coagulation-fibrinolysis system tends to decompensate, reflected in a disseminated intravascular coagulation and/or a pulmonary embolism. The tendency consists particularly in immobilisation and stasis; 3. the daily determination of AT III, better of TAT-complex and D-dimer, the daily clinical examination regarding signs of thrombosis and in cases of heparinization the measurement of PTT several times daily, are necessary to avoid or recognise disorders, of the coagulation-fibrinolysis-system at an early stage. 4. The increased consumption in coagulation systems can be avoided by AT-III substitution and correct heparinisation. 5. In cases of risk of pulmonary embolisation in pregnancy a cava filter should be temporarily implanted. The filter must be changed every 3 days, if it is required for a longer period. 6. In high-risk pregnancy the check for factors of thrombophilia is a basic diagnostic procedure.
