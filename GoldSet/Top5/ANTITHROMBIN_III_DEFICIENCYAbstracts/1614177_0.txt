Consumption coagulopathy in childhood is still a serious problem. Besides treatment of the underlying diseases therapy of consumption coagulopathy was performed with heparin and nowadays with substitution of coagulation factors, especially antithrombin III concentrate, alone or in combination with heparin. We performed administration of AT III concentrates only, without additional heparin treatment in children with proven septicaemia (preterm infants n = 21, children beyond the newborn period n = 18). Antithrombin III, platelet count, fibrinogen, PT, aPTT and TT were assayed. These coagulation parameters turned to be normal 48 hours after normalisation of the antithrombin III plasma level-AT III increased to normal values within 24 hours after the initial substitution in all children. Lethal outcome was not observed after sole administration of AT III as well as no other side effects have been seen. In summary, these data indicate that consumption coagulopathy in childhood can be managed successfully with early substitution of AT III concentrate.
