Antithrombin III (Human) (AT III) was administered to 18 patients with documented hereditary AT III deficiency. In eight patients with no ongoing clinical symptoms of thrombosis, the percent increase per unit AT III infused per kilogram of body weight ranged from 1.56% to 2.74%, and the half-life from 43.3 to 77.0 hours. No significant difference was noted between patients receiving and those not receiving coumarin therapy. In clinically ill patients, the in vivo recovery was significantly lower and ranged from 0.64% to 1.90% increase per unit AT III infused/kg. Efficacy of AT III was evaluated in 13 patients for the prevention or treatment of thrombosis. AT III was efficacious as assessed by the absence of thrombotic complications after surgery and/or parturition, and the nonextension and nonrecurrence of thrombosis in patients exhibiting an acute thrombotic episode. No side effects were noted. Follow-up studies indicated no hepatitis B seroconversion and no alanine aminotransferase elevations in patients who were not transfused with other blood products.
