AIM: In Japan, acute pulmonary thromboembolism (APTE) is still rare, but the number of patients with APTE has been steadily increasing. It is important for early diagnosis and early management of APTE to recognize epidemiological characteristics of this condition. METHODS: We investigated the epidemiological characteristics of 252 patients with APTE who were admitted to our institutions between 1975 and 2001. APTE was more prevalent in women that in men. It was observed the most in the age group between 50s to 70s, especially in women. Many patients had prolonged immobilization, recent major operation, obesity, or cancer, as risk factors for venous thromboembolism. One hundred and thirty-eight patients developed APTE in hospital; 60 patients were in Department of Internal Medicine, 28 in General Surgery, 15 in Orthopedics, 15 in Obstetrics and Gynecology, and 20 in other services. RESULTS: Among 58 patients with malignancy, 43% had cancers in digestive organs, 21% in gynecological, and 17% in urological. Among 61 patients who were examined for the presence of thrombophilia, 13 patients had inherited thrombophilia (8 protein C deficiency, 4 protein S deficiency, and 1 antithrombin III deficiency) 11 had antiphospholipid antibodies which indicated thrombophilia. Five out of the above 61 patients (8%) had no obvious risk factors including thrombophilia. CONCLUSION: The findings in our patients were almost the same as those in Western patients, except for some points. These results might be useful to establish a preventive approach for APTE in Japan.
