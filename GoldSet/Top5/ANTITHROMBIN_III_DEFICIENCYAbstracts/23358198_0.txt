Inherited thrombophilias are thought to play an important role in the cause of pulmonary embolism and its recurrence. Ninety of 281 patients objectively diagnosed as pulmonary embolism between 2006 and 2009 were included in the study. The screening for thrombophilia included mutations of factor V Leiden (FVL), prothrombin (PTM) G20210A, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase C677T-A1298C, the serum levels of antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, factor VIII and activated protein C resistance. Forty-two male (46.7%) and 48 female (53.3%) patients had a mean age of 62.6 ± 13.4 years. Patients with common thrombophilias comprised 30% of all cases (FVL: 19.1%, PTM G20210A: 3.4%, antithrombin III deficiency: 1.1%, protein C deficiency: 5.7%, protein S deficiency: 13.6%). A significant association between recurrence of pulmonary embolism (10 patients, 12.2%) and protein S deficiency was established (P = 0.040). Serum level of protein C was also significantly lower in the subgroup of recurrent pulmonary embolism (P = 0.049). FVL and PTM mutations were high in cancer patients; the presence of inherited thrombophilia was low with risk factors of surgery and immobilization. Genetic risk factors were high in patients with pulmonary embolism. Protein C and S deficiencies may play a role in pulmonary embolism recurrence. DVT or family history of pulmonary embolism was not found to be related to inherited thrombophilias. Surgery and immobilization were thought not to have priorities for detection of genetic risk factors. The high percentages of FVL and PTM mutations in cancer patients should be considered.
