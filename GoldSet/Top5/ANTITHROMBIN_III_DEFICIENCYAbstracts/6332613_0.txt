Antithrombin III (AT III) is the most important inhibitor for factor X and thrombin. Hence, it essentielly influences the regulation of haemostasis. In the aetiology of AT III decreases, hereditary as well as acquired deficiencies can be differentiated. With the exception of patients with hereditary AT III deficiency it is not possible to define the heavy tendency of thrombosis clearly on a biochemical basis. Acquired AT III decreases lead much often to clinical relevant problems than the congenital ones. Since 1974 we substitute AT III using AT III concentrates. The evaluation of the clinical success was often impeded due to the polypragmatic additional therapy. Well-founded and strict indications for the substitution of AT III with a therapeutical concentrate are acute macro- and microthrombosis with decreased AT III levels, e.g. in severe thromboembolic diseases and in hereditary AT III deficiencies. Concerning other clinical pictures with acquired AT III deficiency, a substitution may be indicated very reasonably, however, further studies are necessary to prove this.
