We examined the changes of haemostatic molecular markers after antithrombin III (AT III) administration in a 22-year-old woman with congenital AT III deficiency in the third trimester of pregnancy who did not have thrombosis. Various markers including fibrinopeptide A (FPA), thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 (F1 + 2), plasmin-alpha 2antiplasmin, D-dimer, beta-thromboglobulin, and platelet factor 4 were measured before and just after 3,000 U of AT III concentrate, which was given three times per week from the 34 week of pregnancy until delivery. Just after AT III administration, F1 + 2 and FPA levels decreased on most occasions, while TAT sometimes increased. Plasma FPA levels were markedly decreased on all 8 occasions when the plasma FPA levels was above 2.0 ng/ml before AT III administration. Plasma FPA levels were always greater than or equal to 6.4 ng/ml before AT III administration on the 4 occasions when TAT increased to above 115%. The changes of plasma F1 + 2 levels were significantly correlated with the AT III level. These results suggest that prophylactic AT III administration in the third trimester immediately inactivates intravascular thrombin to form TAT and reduce the plasma FPA level. Thus, the transient TAT elevation following AT III administration may not only be due to extraction of thrombin from the fibrin clots of thrombi but also to intravascular thrombin which is not attached to thrombi. FPA is the best molecular marker for thrombin hyperactivity and it should be monitored in AT III-deficient pregnant women in the third trimester.
