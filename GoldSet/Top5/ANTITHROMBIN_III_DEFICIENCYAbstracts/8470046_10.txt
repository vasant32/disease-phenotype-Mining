OBJECTIVES: To determine whether functional antithrombin III (AT-III) levels measured by a factor Xa inhibition (AT-III-Xa) assay identifies AT-III deficient individuals more reliably than functional AT-III levels measured by a thrombin inhibition (AT-III-IIa) assay. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PATIENT POPULATION: Sixty-seven members of a large family with type 2 AT-III deficiency. INTERVENTION: DNA analysis was used as the reference diagnostic standard for AT-III status and subjects were classified as AT-III deficient or non deficient according to these results. Functional AT-III levels were measured in all subjects using: 1) a chromogenic substrate for thrombin and added human thrombin (AT-III-IIa), and 2) a chromogenic substrate for factor Xa and added bovine factor Xa (AT-III-Xa). Functional heparin cofactor II (HC-II) levels were measured using a commercially available kit. The proportions of 125I-alpha-thrombin complexed to AT-III and HC-II were measured by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. RESULTS: Thirty-one (46%) individuals were classified as AT-III deficient and 36 (54%) as AT-III non deficient. AT-III-Xa assay measured a significantly lower mean AT-III value and a narrower range for individuals classified as AT-III deficient than the AT-III-IIa assay. Using the AT-III-IIa assay, six subjects had borderline AT-III levels compared to none with the AT-III-Xa assay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
