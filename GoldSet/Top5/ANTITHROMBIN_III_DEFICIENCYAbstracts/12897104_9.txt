 BACKGROUND: In congenital or acquired antithrombin III-deficient patients undergoing haemodialysis, coagulation or residual blood in the blood circuit and dialyser is commonly observed under anticoagulation with heparin. Argatroban, a synthetic thrombin antagonist, directly inhibits thrombin activity in a manner that is different from that of heparin, thereby displaying an anticoagulating effect without the activation of antithrombin III. For this reason, the anticoagulating effect of argatroban in haemodialysis patients with antithrombin III deficiency was investigated. METHODS: A retrospective nationwide survey was conducted among patients with congenital or acquired antithrombin III deficiency who had undergone haemodialysis with argatroban as an anticoagulant from April 1996 to April 2000. Inclusion criteria were patients with antithrombin III activity <70% of normal, and patients in whom blood coagulation or residual blood in the extracorporeal circuit could not be prevented by the use of heparin during haemodialysis. RESULTS: Of 80 patients who underwent haemodialysis with argatroban, 59 met the inclusion criteria. Compared with the data before the administration of argatroban, significant improvements of residual blood in the dialyser and arterial and venous drip chambers were observed at the last administration of argatroban. A significant rise in antithrombin III activity was also observed. Among 80 safety analysis cases, no adverse events were reported in 66 patients (82.5%). As severe adverse events, one showed bleeding tendency and one had prolongation of prothrombin time. CONCLUSION: Argatroban was an effective and safe anticoagulant for haemodialysis in patients with congenital or acquired antithrombin III deficiency.
