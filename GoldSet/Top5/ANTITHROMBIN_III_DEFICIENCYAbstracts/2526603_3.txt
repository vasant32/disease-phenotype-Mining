Disorders that predispose children to venous thrombosis include inherited abnormalities of antithrombin III, protein S, protein C, fibrinogen, and plasminogen. Arterial thrombosis may result from disorders that produce endothelial damage, abnormal vascular flow, or increased platelet aggregation. We present here a case of a child who had recurrent thromboses and discuss the evaluation and management of such patients.
