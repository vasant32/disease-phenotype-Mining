Some pathogenetic aspects and diagnostic problems in venous thrombosis are briefly discussed. Emphasis is put on the value of blood tests. It is concluded that the various tests are neither able to detect ongoing thrombosis, nor to identify a prethrombotic state. The necessity of direct demonstration of the thrombus preferably by phlebography is stressed. The tests are valuable as a part of the "coagulation profile", and may aid to discover e.g. antithrombin III deficiency or subnormal fibrinolytic activity.
