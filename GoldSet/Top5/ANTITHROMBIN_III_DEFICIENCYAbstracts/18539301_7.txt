A mathematical model comprised of 23 reaction-diffusion equations is used to simulate the biochemical changes and transport of various reactants involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis in quiescent plasma. The growth and lysis of a thrombus, as portrayed by the model equations, is governed by boundary conditions that include the surface concentration of TF-VIIa, the generation of XIa by contact activation (in vitro), and the secretion of tPA due to endothelial activation. We apply the model to two clinically relevant hypercoagulable states, caused by deficiency of either antithrombin III or protein C. These predictions are compared with published experimental data which validate the utility of the developed model under the special case of static conditions. The incorporation of varying hemodynamic conditions in to the current fluid static model remains to be performed.
