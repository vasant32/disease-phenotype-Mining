A 19-year-old woman developed gradually worsening abdominal pain, signs of peritonitis, and hematemesis. Laparotomy revealed peritonitis due to segmental small-bowel infarction, and the underlying pathologic condition was mesenteric vein thrombosis. A primary thrombotic disorder was suggested and antithrombin III deficiency was found. Before anticoagulant therapy could be initiated, she developed hemorrhagic cerebral infarction and died. Her history included three episodes of deep vein thrombosis while taking oral contraceptives. Her father died of spontaneous mesenteric and portal vein thrombosis at age 29 years. This report underlines the importance of careful interpretation of the vascular pathology in cases of intestinal ischemia.
