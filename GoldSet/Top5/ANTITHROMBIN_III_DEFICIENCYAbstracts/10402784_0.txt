In our institute, 1 ml of heparin is administered to the patients undergoing CABG before dissection and mobilization of the internal thoracic arteries (ITAs) and/or right gastroepiploic artery (GEA) to prevent possible thrombosis or coagulation tendency. Two patients with AT III deficiency underwent CABG and one of them died. The aim of this study is to know whether ACT check before and after administration of 1 ml of heparin is useful as a screening test of coagulation abnormalities including AT III deficiency. One hundred patients (84 males and 16 females) undergoing CABG were studied. Age ranged from 41 to 79 years (mean 64.8 +/- 8.0 years). One ml of heparin was administered to all the patients before ITAs and/or GEA were dissected and mobilized. ACT was doubly checked before (control ACT: c-ACT) and after (heparinized ACT: h-ACT) administration of heparin. ACT extension was defined as follows: ACT extension = (c-ACT)-(h-ACT). Mean c-ACT was 124 +/- 12 sec., h-ACT 188 +/- 26 sec. and ACT extension 64 +/- 24 sec. There were only 3 cases which ACT extension were less than 30 sec.: two of them were combined with AT III deficiency and the other was due to insufficient administration of heparin. In conclusion, examination of ACT after 1 ml administration of heparin is new, simple and convenient screening method for coagulation abnormalities including AT III deficiency during CABG.
