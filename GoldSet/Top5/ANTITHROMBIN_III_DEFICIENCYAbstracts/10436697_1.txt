We report 10 patients with congenital deficiencies of the natural anticoagulant proteins S, C and antithrombin III. Thirteen of a total of 30 pregnancies were managed at the perinatal branch of our department. We discuss the mechanism of action of these proteins and their role in thrombotic events. We analyze the most frequent thrombotic complications and we discuss the general guidelines for the investigation of a patient with a suspected congenital thrombophilia with special regard to its management during pregnancy, delivery and perinatal outcome.
