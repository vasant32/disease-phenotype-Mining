A total of 260 consecutive patients, referred for hypercoagulable assessment, was included in this study. Four coagulation activation markers were utilized to assess these patients [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for soluble fibrin polymer (TpP), prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and D-dimer]. The mean levels of the activation markers directly correlated with the number of hypercoagulable abnormalities. The percentage of patients with increased TpP levels for each group was lower than the other activation markers. The findings indicate that activation markers reflect the number of underlying thrombophilic abnormalities. Our data suggest that there is a utility in performing a panel of coagulation activation markers to assess the thrombotic risk. The measurement of soluble fibrin polymer may be more reflective of an impending vascular event.
