Familial antithrombin III (AT III) deficiency, with mesenteric venous thrombosis, is reported in an Australian family. Antithrombin III was assayed chromogenically, fluorometrically, and immunologically. The deficiency was further analysed using crossed-immunoelectrophoresis. It is suggested that when AT III deficiency is suspected, both a functional and an immunological assay should be performed.
