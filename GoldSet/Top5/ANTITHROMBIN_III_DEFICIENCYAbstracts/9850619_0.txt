Inherited antithrombin (AT) deficiency is a major cause of venous thromboembolism, especially in relation to surgery and pregnancy. We present six AT deficient pregnant women, who successfully delivered seven babies at the Department of Gynaecology/Obstetrics, Aalborg Hospital. From conception, or if possible prior to conception, the women were treated with unfractionated (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) throughout the pregnancy. If the pregnancy was without complication, AT substitution was only used at delivery and for approximately a week post-partum, when warfarin treatment was re-instituted.
