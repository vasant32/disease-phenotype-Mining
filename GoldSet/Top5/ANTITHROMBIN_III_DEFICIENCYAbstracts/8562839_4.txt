Pregnancy limits the therapeutic options for managing thrombocytopenia which occurs in 5% of patients on heparin. We describe a case of extensive thromboembolism associated with antithrombin (AT) deficiency complicated by thrombocytopenia which resolved when low-molecular-weight heparin was instituted. A primigravid woman presented at 11 weeks gestation with bilateral femoral occlusive thrombi extending above the renal veins. Investigations revealed AT deficiency, thrombocytopenia and renal infarction. After low-molecular-weight heparin was substituted for unfractionated heparin, the thrombocytopenia resolved and although the pregnancy was lost, the patient made a full recovery.
