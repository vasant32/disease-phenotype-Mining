BACKGROUND: Portal vein thrombosis, usually idiopathic, is the cause of portal hypertension in 46% of Indian patients, who present with a variceal bleed. The presence of lupus anticoagulant (LA) and antithrombin III deficiency have been reported to be associated with an increased tendency to venous thrombosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 30 patients with portal venous thrombosis diagnosed by ultrasound. Two patients were positive for a lupus anticoagulant and both had very prolonged partial thromboplastin time with kaolin. None of the patients had antithrombin III deficiency.
