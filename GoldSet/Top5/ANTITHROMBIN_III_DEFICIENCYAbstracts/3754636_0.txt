Deep venous thrombosis is a complex process involving many factors in the circulatory system, an important one apparently being the intrinsic fibrinolytic system. Specific activators of the process include venous trauma and hypercoagulability states. In spite of efforts at prophylaxis, venous thrombosis will occur, a dangerous condition in itself and also a precursor of pulmonary embolism. Several schemes for prophylaxis, including drug regimens and mechanical means, have been tried, and future research will surely identify others. A patient's best protection against thrombosis at present, however, is a vigilant physician with a high index of suspicion who will expedite diagnosis and treatment if necessary.
