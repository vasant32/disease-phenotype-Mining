It is estimated that 5% of patients with deep vein thrombosis and 50% of those with recurrent thrombosis have an inherited abnormality of coagulation, most commonly deficiency of protein C, protein S or antithrombin III. These disorders should be suspected when venous thrombosis occurs in a young person, if there is a family history of thrombosis, if thrombosis occurs at an unusual site or if there is recurrent thrombosis with no predisposing factors. Affected patients are treated with lifelong anticoagulation therapy. Thromboembolism and its sequelae often produce abnormal findings on radiologic examinations, and therefore the radiologist who is familiar with these abnormalities is in a position to be the first to suggest the diagnosis.
