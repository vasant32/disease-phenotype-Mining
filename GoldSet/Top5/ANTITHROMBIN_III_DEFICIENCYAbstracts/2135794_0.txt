The chronometric method was applied to 141 diabetics and 151 reference subjects from both sexes aged between 19 and 60 years, all of Black race and Senegalese nationality, to study the effects of Antithrombin III (AT III). A significant reduction in the physiological activity of antithrombin III (AT III) was observed for ages 36-45 and 56-60 and correlated with obesity and other complications. With our patients, insulin dependence does not seem provoke any reduction in antithrombin III's effectiveness.
