The genetic basis of Type I antithrombin deficiency has been investigated in six unrelated kindred with positive histories of thrombosis using a PCR amplification/direct sequencing approach. Four frameshift mutations, all introducing premature translation termination codons were identified. Thus, deletions, of a C at nucleotide position 2599 or 2600, a G at position 2601-2602 and a CT dinucleotide at position 7428-7429 were detected in three kindred and confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. The identical insertion, of a T at nucleotide 2770, was observed in two apparently unrelated families. This finding may have been due to a founder effect since antithrombin gene polymorphism analysis showed all affected individuals to share a common haplotype. An in frame deletion of 6 bp at nucleotide position 2690-2696 causing the removal of codons 76 and 77 encoding Ile 76 and Phe 77 was also detected indicating that these amino acids are essential for stability of the mature antithrombin.
