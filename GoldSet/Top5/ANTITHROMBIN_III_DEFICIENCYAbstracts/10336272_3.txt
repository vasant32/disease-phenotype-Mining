The elegant report from Hagglund et al1 recently published in Blood raises a very important ethical issue in clinical hematology practice: primum non nocere. The authors describe the impact of norethisterone treatment, routinely used in the prevention of menstrual bleeding in women submitted to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, on veno-occlusive disease, which is one of most dreadful complications of an otherwise successfull stem cell transplantation (SCT). This is an example of how we can interfere dramatically on the outcome of transplantation by simply adding an unsafe drug to the corollary of what we call "supportive treatment." Neverthless, the management of menstrual bleeding during the phase of thrombocytopenia in premenopausal women may still be troublesome and requires specific treatment, particularly when concomitant gynecological disorders are present (ie, uterine fibromyomata or dysfunctionl bleeding), and the use of estroprogestinics should be clearly avoided. Estroprogestinics may induce liver toxicity, primarily intrahepatic cholestasis and transaminitis,2 and they also interfere with hemostasis through a reduction in the natural anticoagulant protein S and an increase in factor II levels inducing a thrombophilic state, which may be further amplified by genetically determined prothrombotic defects that occur fairly commonly in the general population. These defects include activated protein C resistance related to factor V Leiden, factor II G20210 A mutation, or antithrombin III deficiency.3-5
