We described the perioperative management of a patient with congenital antithrombin III deficiency using temporal inferior vena cava filter. A 30-year-old man with congenital antithrombin III deficiency was scheduled for artificial head replacement of the hip joint under general anesthesia. He was diagnosed as having congenital antithrombin III deficiency when he had had an episode of venous thrombosis after artificial head replacement of the right hip joint. He had been taking warfarin as an anticoagulant, and it was discontinued three days before surgery. To prevent perioperative thrombus formation, the plasma AT III activity was maintained above 80% before, during and after surgery using AT III concentrates. We also placed the temporal inferior vena cava filter. There was no serious thrombosis or embolism perioperatively. The use of the filter during the perioperative period helped to avoid development of serious thrombosis and embolism.
