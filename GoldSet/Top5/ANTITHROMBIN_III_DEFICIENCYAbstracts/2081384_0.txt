The thrombin clotting time (TCT) has been used at our institution, along with the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), for monitoring heparin therapy. We have observed that, in some patients, a discrepancy develops between the heparin levels predicted by the TCT and the aPTT with the TCT consistently predicting a lower heparin level than the aPTT. An inverse relationship was noted between the functional antithrombin III (AT-III) level and the magnitude of this discrepancy.
