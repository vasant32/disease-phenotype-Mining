Although in experimental microsurgery a patency rate of almost one hundred percent can be obtained, in clinical experience we now and then encounter a failure where circulation cannot be restored for reasons not known. Cold agglutinins, deficiency of Antithrombin III, and irreversible spasm of the vessel wall may be some of the factors which prevent the restoration of circulation in cases of replantation and free tissue transplantation. It is suggested that we collect such cases in a combined effort to find out more about possible causes.
