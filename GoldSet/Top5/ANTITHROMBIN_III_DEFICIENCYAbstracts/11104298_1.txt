A case of multiple thrombotic diatheses discovered in the setting of mesenteric venous infarction is discussed. The patient had deficiencies of protein C, protein S, antithrombin III; was heterozygous for factor V Leiden; and had polycythemia vera. Adequate anticoagulation could not be established with heparin administration and hirudin was used. The diagnosis of mesenteric venous infarction, thrombotic tendency of multiple coagulation diatheses, and use of hirudin are discussed.
