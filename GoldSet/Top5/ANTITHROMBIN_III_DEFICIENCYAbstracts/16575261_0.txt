Quantitative antithrombin deficiency constitutes an important risk factor for venous thromboembolism, stillbirth, and other complications of pregnancy. Studies suggest, however, that individuals heterozygous for missense mutations involving the heparin-binding site of antithrombin do not have a significantly increased thrombotic risk. Owing to the rarity of such mutations, it remains unclear whether any specific heparin-binding site defects might be associated with thrombotic potential. We report here the case of a pregnant woman with an exceptionally rare Type II heparin-binding site antithrombin variant. This case highlights the difficult issues that are associated with the management of Type II antithrombin deficiency during pregnancy.
