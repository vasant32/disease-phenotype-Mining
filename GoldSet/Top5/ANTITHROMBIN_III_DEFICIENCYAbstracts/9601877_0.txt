In a group of 993 patients with serious medical diseases an important deficiency of antithrombin III was found in patients with hepatic insufficiency, pulmonary embolism and with disseminated intravascular coagulation. Acquired antithrombin III deficiency in these conditions develops when the antithrombin production in the liver is low and also in patients with shock syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Assessment of antithrombin III is of diagnostic and prognostic value in thrombotic and prethrombotic conditions and its results is decisive for adequate substitution. Adequate AT III substitution without concurrent heparin administration in patients with septicaemia and manifestations of DIC improves the prognosis of patients with an increased endothelial resistance.
