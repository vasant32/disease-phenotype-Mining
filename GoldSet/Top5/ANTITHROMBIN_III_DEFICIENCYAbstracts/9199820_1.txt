To determine whether decreases in plasma antithrombin (AT) level, as seen in non-gestational acquired AT deficiency, result from a hypercoagulable state and/or liver/kidney damage, AT activity was measured in 24 uncomplicated and 30 preeclamptic women. The fifth percentile of AT levels in the normal pregnancies was used as a cut-off value to subdivide the preeclamptic patients into two groups. Markers of activated coagulation, i.e, levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), fibrin D-dimer, soluble fibrin, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and platelet counts, were determined. Indicators of hepatic or renal function, i.e. concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine, urinary albumin (U-albumin) and serum albumin (S-albumin), were assayed. AT levels were lower in those with preeclampsia than in the normal pregnancy group (P < 0.01). In the group with AT levels less than the cut-off point, levels of fibrin D-dimer (P < 0.05), soluble fibrin (P < 0.05), vWF (P < 0.05), ALT (P < 0.05), AST (P < 0.05), creatinine (P < 0.01) and U-albumin (P < 0.01) were increased, whereas platelet counts (P < 0.05) and S-albumin (P < 0.05) were decreased. All patients with ALT levels > 0.46 mu kat/1, AST > 0.58 mu kat/1, S-albumin < 23 g/1 and/or U-albumin > 4.9 g/24 h had AT levels < or = cut off. AT levels correlated with vWF (rs = - 0.73, P < 0.01) and creatinine (Rs = -0.70, P < 0.01). It is suggested that in preeclampsia, acquired AT deficiency is secondary to a hypercoagulable state, and/or associated with impaired hepatic and/or renal function.
