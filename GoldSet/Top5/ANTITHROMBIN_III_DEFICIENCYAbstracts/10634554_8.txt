BACKGROUND: Central retinal vein occlusion is a disease that is most common in old people, and often associated with atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes or glaucoma. Since these diseases are much less evident in young people, we wanted to investigate the prevalence of disorders in the most common anticoagulant proteins in a group of young patients with central retinal vein occlusion. METHODS: 37 consecutive patients younger than 50 years and with a history of central retinal vein occlusion, were analysed for deficiencies of natural inhibitors of coagulation (protein C, S, and antithrombin III), plasminogen, resistance to activated protein C, and the presence of anticardiolipin or lupus anticoagulants. RESULTS: Anticoagulant protein deficiencies were found in 4 patients (11%) and activated protein C resistance in 7 patients (19%). Anticardiolipin or lupus anticoagulants were not found in the patients. CONCLUSION: Activated protein C resistance and anticoagulant protein deficiencies seem to be important factors to the etiology to central retinal vein occlusion in young patients.
