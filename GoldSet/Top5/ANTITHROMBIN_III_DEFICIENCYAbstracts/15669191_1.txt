 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of anticoagulation protein defect in the pathogenesis of unexplained recurrent miscarriage. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with a history of unexplained abortion were enrolled as the investigation group for tests of protein C, protein S, antithrombin III (AT-III), as well as activated protein C resistance (APC-R). The control group consisted of fifty healthy women with a history of normal pregnancy and delivery. Blood samples were obtained for, measuring serum activity of protein C, protein S, AT-III, and APC-R. Patients with positive APC-R were tested for factor V (FV) Leiden gene mutation by PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: Of the 57 patients, 12 (21.1%), 1 (1.8%), and 5 (8.8%) cases were found with protein S, protein C, and AT-III deficiency respectively, and 13 (22.8%) cases with positive results of APC-R. Of the control group, no protein C or AT-III deficiency was ever found, whereas 2 (4.0%) volunteers were presented with protein S deficiency and 3 (6.0%) with positive results of APC-R. No FV Leiden gene mutation was identified in all the patients with positive APC-R results. Late spontaneous abortion cases had higher incidence of anticoagulation protein defect than the early cases. CONCLUSION: Anticoagulation protein defect may play a role in the pathogenesis of fetal loss, especially for those occurring in late stage of pregnancy.
