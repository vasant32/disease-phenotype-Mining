OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to examine whether genetic thrombophilias are etiological factors for recurrent fetal miscarriage or not. STUDY DESIGN: We compared the rate of thrombophilic anomalies in women with unexplained recurrent fetal miscarriages to the rate of age-matched women with successful pregnancies as a case-control study. RESULTS: A total of 101 consecutive patients with 102 age-matched controls were included in the study. The rate of Factor V (FV) Leiden mutation, Factor (F) II mutation, protein S, protein C, antithrombin III deficiencies and overall thrombophilia in patients with recurrent fetal loss was significantly higher than the frequencies in control patients. CONCLUSION: Women with recurrent fetal miscarriages have an increased incidence of thrombophilia. Genetic thrombophilias may be one of the major etiological factors for recurrent abortion and fetal demise.
