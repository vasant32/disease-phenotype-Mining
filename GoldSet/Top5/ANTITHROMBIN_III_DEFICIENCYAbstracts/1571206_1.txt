This paper describes a healthy 13-year-old girl presenting with acute flank pain and anuria due to renal vein thrombosis. A similar spontaneous and unexplained thrombosis resulted in the loss of the contralateral kidney 1 year earlier. Urgent surgical thrombectomy and anticoagulation resulted in moderate recovery of renal function. Predisposition to venous thrombosis in this child was secondary to a marked familial deficiency of circulating antithrombin-III. An early diagnosis of this condition is essential for the formulation of preventive measures and may lead to specific therapeutic intervention at the onset of acute thrombotic complications.
