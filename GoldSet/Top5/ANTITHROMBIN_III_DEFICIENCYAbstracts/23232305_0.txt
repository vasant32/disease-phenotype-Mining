Purpose: A 41-year-old woman with familial antithrombin-III deficiency was admitted to our hospital for patch closure of an atrial septal defect. Antithrombin-III activity was 43% and its antigen level was 12.2 mg/dl, was diagnosed so type I antithrombin-IIIdeficiency was diagnosed.Methods: A dose of 2500 U of antithrombin-III concentrate was administered at 1 day before surgery, 1 hour before surgery, and 1 day after surgery. Heparinazation was performed at 200 IU/kg and the activated clotting time increased from a baseline of 140s to 622s. After establishing cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest, closure of the septal defect was done with a pericardial patch.Results: The activated clotting time was maintained at more than 400s during cardiopulmonary bypass. There were no intraoperative complications and the postoperative course was uneventful.Conclusion: In patients with familial antithrombin-III deficiency, administration of antithrombin-III concentrate is effective when cardiopulmonary bypass is required.
