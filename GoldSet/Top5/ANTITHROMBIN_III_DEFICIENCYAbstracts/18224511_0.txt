We reported here a case of bilateral chylothorax as a result of widespread thrombi formation in a patient who was heterozygote for factor V leiden gene mutation and who had antithrombin III deficiency. We performed bilateral chest tubes, thrombolytic and oral anticoagulant therapy. The patient responded to the therapy. She has been in follow up without symptoms for 18 months.
