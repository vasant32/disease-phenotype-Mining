Two patients with familial antithrombin III deficiency developed deep venous thrombosis of the lower limb. The diagnosis of venous thrombosis was made by the indium labelled platelet technique which also allowed for the daily assessment of thrombus size. Each patient received treatment with Warfarin, subcutaneous heparin, and infusions of antithrombin III concentrates. The authors conclude that infusions of antithrombin III concentrates may be of value in limiting the extent of acute thrombosis in patients with a severe deficiency of this protein and may help prevent pulmonary embolism. The haemorrhagic risk of continuing modest doses of heparin with high dose ATIII therapy appears small. In addition to its value in the diagnosis of venous thrombosis the indium platelet technique may give an early indication of thrombus extension and may thus indicate the effectiveness of treatment.
