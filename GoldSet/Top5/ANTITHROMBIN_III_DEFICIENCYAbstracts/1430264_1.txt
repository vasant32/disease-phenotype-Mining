A young man with antithrombin III (AT-III) deficiency sustained a cerebellar venous infarct and recovered following treatment with AT-III concentrate. A family study showed that other members were affected. AT-III deficiency in this family was found to be due to a new variant AT-III TRURO 1. Young patients with strokes should be screened for thrombophilia.
