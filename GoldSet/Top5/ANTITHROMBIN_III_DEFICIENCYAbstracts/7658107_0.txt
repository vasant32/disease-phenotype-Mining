Although various hematological disorders have been considered to be etiologic factors in deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the involvement of dysplasminogenemia (DPG) in DVT has not been studied in detail. In 72 consecutive DVT patients, the presence of DVT was suspected based on a history of lower limb swelling and tenderness with acute onset, and was confirmed by duplex scanning, radioisotope venography, or contrast venography. DPG was identified by the observation of dissociation between the activity and antigenicity of plasminogen. Of the 72 patients, 9 (12.5%) were diagnosed as having DPG, and several antithrombin-III deficiency and protein C and S deficiency were identified. The mean age of the genetically normal and DPG patients was 52 +/- 15 and 40 +/- 15 years, respectively (p < 0.05). Thus, these findings suggest that DPG is deeply related to the development of DVT, and that abnormality of the fibrinolytic system is one of the major etiologic factors in DVT.
