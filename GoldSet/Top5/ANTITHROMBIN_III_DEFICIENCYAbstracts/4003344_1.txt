In an antithrombin-III (AT-III) deficient patient suffering from recurrent episodes of venous and arterial thrombosis requiring major surgery an attempt was made to institute antithrombotic protection by long-term stanozolol treatment supplemented during periods of thrombogenic exposure with subcutaneous heparin and, when needed, infusion of AT-III as plasma or concentrate. Stanozolol raised the plasma levels of AT-III, demonstrating a sparing effect on the AT-III needed. Despite the repeated exposures to major surgery, protection against venous thrombosis was complete, but the arterial disease progressed and led to the demise of the patient.
