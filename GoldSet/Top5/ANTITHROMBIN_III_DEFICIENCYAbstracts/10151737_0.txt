Development of institutional guidelines for use of high-cost biotechnology drugs, such as antithrombin III, is a valuable tool in formulary management. This article describes the process by which the University of California Davis Medical Center used an ad hoc committee to the P & T Committee to develop guidelines for antithrombin III use. Performing an objective analysis of available literature to address the appropriate role of a biotechnology agent is necessary to develop consensus guidelines. Approval of use guidelines by the P & T Committee provides the necessary structure for optimal use of biotechnology agents, such as antithrombin III.
