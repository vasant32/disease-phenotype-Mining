Severe infections and particularly infectious shock are frequently accompanied by a varying degrees of disseminated intra-vascular coagulation (DIC). The mechanism at work is complex, involving endotoxin or bacterial lipopolysaccharide constituents that damage vascular endothelium and activate intrinsic coagulation, platelet function and the release of leucocyte coagulation-promoting compounds. The activation of coagulation in turn activates prekallikrein and complement and plays a part in shock. The laboratory plays an essential role in diagnosing DIC, determining its repercussions on the parameters of haemostasis and in monitoring its course under antibiotics, which in some cases may be combined with carefully controlled heparin treatment. Sensitive and specific tests are the assays for fibrinogen-fibrin degradation products (FDP) and soluble complexes (SC) using the haemagglutination test or the ethanol test. The platelet count should be combined with measurement of the bleeding time. A varying degree of thrombopenia is frequent but non specific. In cases of septicemia, it is an early warning sign. A selective fall in proaccelerin is an indirect early sign. A fall in antithrombin III (AT III) is considered a good sign of DIC but it does not occur in every case, and is most liable to be present in liver failure. From the FDP and fibrinogen results, it should be clear whether one is dealing with compensated, decompensated or even over-compensated DIC. Diagnosis should be complemented by a careful search for the clinical signs of coagulation and haemorrhage. It is indispensable for investigations to be repeated every 6-12 hours, for the sake both of treatment strategy, which can be extremely difficult, and DIC monitoring.
