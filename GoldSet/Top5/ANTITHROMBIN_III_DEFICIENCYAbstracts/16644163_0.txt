A 4-year-old boy was admitted with left hemiplegia. Thrombophilia marker examination resulted with factor V Leiden mutation heterozygosity, a deficiency of antithrombin III and a high level of factor VIII. Cranial computed tomography scan revealed an ischemic infarct in the region of right anterior cerebral artery. In the literature, combinations of multiple thrombophilia risk factors that trigger cerebral ischemic stroke in children have been emphasized. To our knowledge, this is the first child with these combinations of thrombophilia risk factors and ischemic stroke to be reported in the literature.
