A 21-year-old patient presented with extensive thrombosis of the mesenteric veins. He was in a serious condition after laparatomy in another hospital. The cause of the thrombotic event was found to be an inherited antithrombin III-deficiency. As a sole therapeutic possibility a systemic lysis with streptokinase was performed and was followed by a favourable immediate result. Unfortunately the subsequent course was complicated by a histologically confirmed necrotizing arteritis which was responsible for the lethal outcome 57 days after admission.
