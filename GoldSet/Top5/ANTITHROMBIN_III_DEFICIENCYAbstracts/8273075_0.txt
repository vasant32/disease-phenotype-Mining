Thromboembolic disease is a major clinical problem. This article reviews the etiology and pathogenesis of spontaneous venous thromboembolism. There is an association between thromboembolism and hereditary deficiency of antithrombin III, protein C or protein S. In young patients, impaired fibrinolytic activity may represent the most common haemostatic abnormality associated with thrombosis. Dysfibrinogenaemia has been related to thrombotic disease in some patients. Moreover, the presence of phospholipid directed antibodies is associated with thrombosis in patients with connective tissue disorders. Therefore, for young patients with spontaneous thromboembolic disease, a thorough laboratory investigation is recommended.
