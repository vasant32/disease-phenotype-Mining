OBJECTIVE: To present the first report of a thromboembolic complication in early pregnancy after ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF in a patient with AT III deficiency who was treated successfully and subsequently delivered a healthy male infant at 32 weeks of gestation. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Hospital-based clinic for reproductive medicine. PATIENT: A 28-year-old woman who consulted our IVF clinic with a 3.5-year history of primary infertility. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous heparin therapy. RESULTS: The patient responded adequately to heparin therapy and was discharged home on SC heparin. A primary cesarean section was performed at 32 weeks of gestation because of poor fetal growth and transverse lie. CONCLUSIONS: We stress the importance of obtaining a thorough personal and family history before initiation of ovarian hyperstimulation. Measuring activity of AT III, protein C, and protein S in patients with a suspicious history of thromboembolic episodes occurring at an early age may lead to the implementation of appropriate prophylactic measures, preventing potentially life-threatening complications.
