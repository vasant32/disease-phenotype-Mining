Budd Chiari syndrome is a rare disorder resulting from hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction anywhere from the small hepatic veins to the suprahepatic inferior vena cava. This patient has a hypercoagulable state secondary to heterozygous mutation of factor V and the JAK2 mutation and is being anticoagulated. We hypothesize that the low protein C and low antithrombin III levels seen in this patient resulted from decreased synthetic function of the liver and were not indicative of actual deficiencies. Indeed, reports of coexisting protein C and antithrombin III deficiencies are not existent in the literature and likely are not compatible with life. All patients with BCS warrant a hypercoagulable work up and JAK2 mutation is increasingly recognized as a contributing factor, even in those patients without obvious signs of polycythemia vera.
