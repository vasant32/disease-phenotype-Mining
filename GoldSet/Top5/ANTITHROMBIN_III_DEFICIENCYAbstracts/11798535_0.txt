OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of anticoagulant proteins deficiency in Chinese patients with venous thrombosis. METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with otherwise unexplained venous thrombophilia were studied. Both the antigen and antivitity of PC, PS, and antithrombin III (ATIII) were determined using commercial kits (Stago, or IL) activated PC, sensitivity ratio (APC-SR) by Coatest chromogenix, and factor V gene mutation by polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragments long polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: Of all the patients twenty-five were found to be abnormal. These consisted of 3 ATIII deficiencies, 5 PC deficiencies, 10 PS deficiencies, 2 resistance of activated protein C (APC-R), 1 combined ATIII and PC deficiency, 1 combined ATIII and PS deficiency, 1 combined PC and PS deficiency, 1 combined APC-R and PC deficiency and 1 combined APC-R and PS deficiency. The overall prevalence of ATIII, PC and PS deficiencies was 26.4%. The patients with anticoagulant proteins deficiency had earlier onset (35.2 +/- 9.7 vs 42.1 +/- 10.9; P < 0.01) and more recurrent thrombosis (P < 0.05), as well as more pulmonary embolism (44.0% vs 16.1%; P < 0.01) than those of without anticoagulant protein deficiency. CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of ATIII, PC, and PS deficiency in Chinese venous thrombosis patients was higher than that of Western patients. It suggests that the etiology of thrombophilia may be different between Chinese and Western.
