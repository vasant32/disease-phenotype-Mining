OBJECTIVE: To assess the fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion indications in a Mexican hospital. SETTING: A general hospital for federal government employees located in the city of Morelia, State of Michoacan, Mexico. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated all FFP transfusions between February and August, 1998 classifying them as appropriate or inappropriate according to the recent FFP-transfusion guidelines: correction of known coagulation factor deficiencies with bleeding and correction of microvascular bleeding when prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time are > 1.6 times normal (coagulation index o CI), urgent reversal of warfarin therapy, antithrombin III deficiency, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura treatment, liver transplant and acute disseminated intravascular coagulation. RESULTS: 78 patients with 292 FFP units transfused were analyzed: in 20 patients the indication was clotting support, 16 with CI < 1.5 and four with CI > 1.6, one with blood loss and one with surgical procedure; hypoalbuminemia in 10; hypovolemia in eight; unidentified reason in 33 and others in seven patients. Eleven units (3.76%) were considered properly transfused whereas 281 (96.23%) were inadequately indicated.
