Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTE-PH) is an infrequent cause of pulmonary hypertension that develops in 0.1-0.2% of patients who survive after an acute venous thromboembolic event. According to the largest series so far reported, 15-30% of patients with diagnosis of CTE-PH have an underlying congenital or acquired hypercoagulable state. To determine the prevalence of thrombophilic factors in our population, we analyzed 24 patients admitted to our institution between November 1992 and March 2000 fulfilling criteria for CTE-PH. Eighteen patients disclosed abnormal results in the screening for thrombophilia. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anticardiolipin antibodies) was the abnormality most frequently found (12 out of 24 patients). We found hyperhomocysteinaemia in 7/14, true protein S deficiency in 1/10, protein C deficiency in 1/13, activated protein C resistance in 1/22, antithrombin III deficiency in 1/24, and prothrombin gene G20210A mutation in 1/18 patients. Factor V Leiden was normal in all 18 patients studied. Five patients (20.8%) disclosed more than one thrombophilic abnormality. In conclusion, contrary to the largest series of patients with CTE-PH so far reported, we found that 75% of patients with CTE-PH presented at least one thrombophilic risk factor, being antiphospholipid antibodies in 50% of the cases. We recommend a thorough screening for thrombophilia in all patients with diagnosis of CTE-PH.
