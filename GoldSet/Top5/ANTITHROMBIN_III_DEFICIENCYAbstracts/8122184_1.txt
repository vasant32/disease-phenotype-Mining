Heparin effectively prevents the complications of unstable angina but disease reactivation has been documented following its discontinuation. To investigate whether this could be related to antithrombin-III depletion, 50 patients with unstable angina had serial determinations of activated partial thromboplastin time and of the plasma levels of heparin, antithrombin-III activity and of the thrombin-antithrombin-III complex before, during and, in a subgroup of 8 patients, 4 hours after heparin discontinuation. Heparin was administered intravenously at therapeutic doses for a mean of 7.6 +/- 4.1 days. Plasma antithrombin-III activity decreased rapidly from 1.05 +/- 0.03 to 1.0 +/- 0.03 U/ml (p < 0.03) following heparin initiation with no further significant subsequent decrease. Antithrombin-III activity returned to the control values 4 hours after the discontinuation of heparin. Thus, heparin treatment is associated with small, non-cumulative and rapidly reversible decrease in antithrombin-III activity. Reactivation of unstable angina after discontinuation of heparin must be explained by a mechanism other than antithrombin-III deficiency.
