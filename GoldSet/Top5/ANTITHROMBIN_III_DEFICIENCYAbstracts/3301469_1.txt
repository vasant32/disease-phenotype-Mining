Human plasma contains two distinct heparin dependent thrombin inhibitors; antithrombin III (ATIII) and Heparin cofactor II (HCII). The latter is also known as antithrombin BM, because of its moderate binding affinity to heparin. The protein is distinct from ATIII by immunological and functional criteria as well as by its amino acid sequence. HCII selectively inhibits thrombin by forming a 1:1 molar complex with the protease and has no activity towards other coagulation serine proteases. Dermatan sulphate, a glycosaminoglycan, specifically activates HCII and increases its thrombin neutralizing activity by over a thousand fold. Dermatan sulphate does not catalyze the activity of ATIII. Human fibroblasts have been shown to accelerate the neutralization of thrombin by HCII. These cells can synthesize proteoglycans containing dermatan sulphate. Current evidence would thus suggest that extravascular tissues are the major sites of action of HCII. The specificity of dermatan sulphate for HCII has allowed the development of functional assays for this protein. Reduced levels have been observed in patients with significant hepatocellular dysfunction and in association with disseminated intravascular coagulation. Two families have been reported with hereditary HCII deficiency and recurrent thrombosis (both venous and arterial). Although these observations suggest a role for HCII in the modulation of hemostatic system, further studies are required to define the importance of HCII deficiency as a marker of thrombosis.
