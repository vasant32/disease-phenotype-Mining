A qualitative defect of antithrombin III (AT III) has been demonstrated over three generations in eight members of an Italian family by the discrepancy between a normal amount of antigen and decreased antithrombin and anti-Xa activity in the presence or in the absence of heparin. By two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis in the absence of heparin, two peaks of AT III were present in all patients' plasma. AT III was purified from normal and propositus plasma by sulfate dextran precipitation followed by heparin affinity chromatography. The elution profile of the patient's AT III was abnormal and allowed the separation of two populations of AT III, normal and abnormal. The first fraction (normal AT III) contained AT III activity, migrated as a single peak by two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), demonstrated a single band with a molecular weight (mol wt) identical to that of normal AT III (60,000). Conversely, the last fraction, devoid of AT III activity, migrated as a single abnormal peak by two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis in the absence of heparin. By SDS-PAGE, two bands were observed: one with a mol wt of 60,000 and a second one with a mol wt of 120,000. Western blots clearly demonstrated cross-reactivity of the 120,000 and 60,000 mol wt bands with monospecific antisera to human AT III. Reduction of the 120,000 mol wt band converted it to a single 60,000 mol wt band, suggesting the presence of an abnormal dimeric form of AT III. The name AT III Milano is proposed for this new variant.
