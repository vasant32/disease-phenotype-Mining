Thromboembolic disease (TED) has been recognized as a complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) since the 1930s (Bargen & Barker 1936). The relative contributions of inherited or acquired thrombophilia and the inflammatory response to the mechanism of this tendency is unclear. Thrombotic events are more common in active disease although significant numbers also occur spontaneously, when the disease is in clinical remission (Talbot et al. 1986; Jackson et al. 1997). Studies looking at the prevalence of specific thrombophilic states such as Antithrombin III deficiency (Jackson et al. 1997; Lake, Stauffer & Stuart 1978; Cianco et al. 1996; Ghosh et al. 1983), Factor V Leiden mutation (APC Resistance) (Jackson et al. 1997; Probert et al. 1997; Ardizzone et al. 1998; Liebman et al. 1998), anticardiolipin antibodies (Ciancio et al. 1996), Protein C (Wyshock, Caldwell & Crowley 1988; Korsten & Reis 1992) and Protein S deficiencies (Jorens et al. 1990; Aadland et al. 1992) in IBD have been contradictory or equivocal. We had previously found that IBD patients with a history of TED are not more likely to have a laboratory thrombophilic abnormality than those with uncomplicated disease. We also demonstrated that the prevalence of heterogenous laboratory thrombophilic abnormalities (usually minor) in all IBD patients may be as high as 60%, much higher than the recognized prevalence of TED (Lim, Jones & Gould 1996). We wondered how this would compare with the healthy non-IBD population. We have therefore explored the prevalence of such thrombophilic abnormalities in a group of IBD patients who had no history of TED and compared them with healthy age and sex matched controls.
