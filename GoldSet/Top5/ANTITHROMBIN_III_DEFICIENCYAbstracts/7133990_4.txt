The study concerns 131 patients with a history of recurrent deep vein thrombosis. The predisposing and triggering factors of thrombosis have been carefully recorded and a study of hemostasis parameters has been performed, including AT III determination, fibrinolytic activity before and after venous occlusion, plasminogen, alpha 2-antiplasmin and histidine-rich glycoprotein determination. A congenital AT III deficiency was detected in six patients (4.4%). The most frequent finding was a decrease in fibrinolytic activity after venous occlusion. If one accounts for patients with a disease predisposing to thrombosis: Beh√ßet's disease, cancer, hiatus hernia, Cockett's syndrome (14 patients), or a biological anomaly such as: deficiency in AT III, decrease in fibrinolytic activity. circulating anticoagulant, increase in lipids or uric acid, decrease in plasminogen or increase in alpha 2-antiplasmin (57 patients), there are still 60 patients (45% of the cases) in whom thromboses remain unexplained.
