Advanced high-throughput molecular cytogenetic analysis has enabled the identification of small chromosomal rearrangements, and two or more concurrently occurring chromosomal rearrangements have been identified using this technique. A girl with severe psychomotor developmental delay associated with an uncertain abnormality (detected by conventional karyotyping) in chromosome 10q had a sudden stroke at the age of 35 months. Laboratory and radiographic examinations revealed antithrombin (AT) deficiency and a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Two concurrent chromosomal aberrations, inverted duplication and deletion in the 10q26 region and a microdeletion in the 1q24.2q25.2 region including the AT gene (SERPINC1), were identified by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis. Both chromosomal aberrations were found to be of paternal origin. This study described the concurrence of chromosomal rearrangements involving two chromosomes, and estimated the frequency of two or more chromosomal aberrations as 2-4%.
