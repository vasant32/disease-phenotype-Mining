The protein C system--a complex physiological coagulation inhibition system--is a major regulator which controls thrombin production. Nowadays, its exploration is indispensable for the detection of constitutional or acquired protein C deficiency, side by side with a search for antithrombin III deficiency. This approach, based on the frequent association of recurrent thrombosis, mainly venous, in young subjects with congenital deficiencies, makes it possible to initiate, beside a family survey, an individual and efficient prophylaxis of recurrent thrombosis.
