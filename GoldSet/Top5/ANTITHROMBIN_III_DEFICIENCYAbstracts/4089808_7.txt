Antithrombin-III activity was determined in 752 patients with a history of venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. 54 patients (7.18%) had an antithrombin-III activity below the normal range. Among these were 13 patients (1.73%) with proven hereditary deficiency. 14 patients were judged to have probable hereditary antithrombin-III deficiency, because they had a positive family history, but antithrombin-III deficiency could not be verified in other members of the family. In the 27 remaining patients (most of them with only slight deficiency) hereditary antithrombin-III deficiency was unlikely. The prevalence of hereditary antithrombin-III deficiency was higher in patients with recurrent venous thrombosis.
