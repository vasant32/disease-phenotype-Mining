We report the case of a newborn male who presented an aortic thrombosis during the neonatal period and was subsequently diagnosed as having antithrombin III (AT III) hereditary deficiency type I. This hypercoagulable condition is known to predispose young adults to venous thrombosis, but in our patient the primary thrombotic incident affected the arterial vessels within the first few days of life. Combined treatment with thrombolytic agents and AT III concentrates recovered aortic permeability, suggesting that the use of AT III may be beneficial for the treatment of thrombotic complications during the first few days of life.
