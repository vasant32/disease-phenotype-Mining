In order to determine a scheme for the screening of inherited thrombotic disorders, abnormalities considered as predisposing to thrombosis have been reviewed. Owing to the low prevalence of biological alterations, a selection of patients is required: documented venous thromboses, possibly at unusual sites (mesenteric vein, portal, cerebral veins), occurring before the age of 40 in patients with a positive family history of thromboses are relatively frequently associated with coagulation abnormalities. In addition, patients with skin necrosis at the initiation of oral anticoagulants, or with repeated superficial vein thrombosis or unexplained arterial occlusions at a young age might be included for screening. Tests have also to be selected. Some abnormalities, such as congenital deficiencies in antithrombin III, protein C and protein S, are recognized risk factors and have to be searched. Some others cannot be at present considered as definite risk factors (e.g., dysfibrinogenemias or deficiencies in factor XII), but their detection is easy by routine tests: prothrombin time, fibrinogen assay. Other abnormalities are recognized risk factors (or not) and need specific uncommon tests (e.g., study of fibrinolysis). Each time a biological abnormality is found, it is important to verify it is isolated since combined deficiencies have been observed and we should be able to answer the question whether the abnormality is the cause or the consequence of thrombosis, or a coincidence. Finally, in our experience, even in well selected patients, a coagulation disorder is detected in less than 30% of patients, so that new tests are needed to improve our knowledge in this field.
