Synthetic, low-molecular weight thrombin inhibitors may substitute for antithrombin III in inactivating thrombin in vitro and in vivo. They are superior to heparin as antithrombotic agents in antithrombin deficiency or consumption. Studies in experimental animals show the effectiveness of synthetic thrombin inhibitors in immunologic antithrombin depletion, thrombin-induced consumption and CCl4-induced liver failure.
