In 1965 Olav Egeberg (1916-77) presented the first report that linked a defined, hereditary defect in the control of blood coagulation to thrombotic disease. Having examined a family in which several members had sustained venous thrombosis, he demonstrated that antithrombin activity was clearly subnormal in the affected members. Heparin cofactor activity was also subnormal in these persons. This supported the hypothesis that the two activities might reside in a single protein. The condition was inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Egeberg's publication initiated thrombophilia as a rewarding research area, and also as an important clinical discipline.
