Thrombo-embolic complications in pregnant women who have congenital antithrombin III deficiency are usually prevented by giving injections of sub-cutaneous heparin from the beginning to the end of pregnancy and with the administration of concentrated doses of antithrombin III (A.T. III) at delivery and in the following days. When we discovered a severe pre-eclampsia at the 28th week of pregnancy in a patient who had congenital deficiency of A.T. III and who had a past history of very severe thrombo-embolic complications we administered concentrated A.T. III as well as continuing the heparin treatment and anti-hypertensive treatment during the pregnancy. Severe fetal distress made us carry out a caesarean operation after 32 weeks of amenorrhoea. Delivery and the post-partum period were conducted without any complications. The newborn baby, who did not have congenital A.T. III deficiency, is very well.
