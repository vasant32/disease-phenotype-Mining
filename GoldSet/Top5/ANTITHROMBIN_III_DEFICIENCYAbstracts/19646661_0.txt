 BACKGROUND: The resection of a vaginal septum using the Harmonic Scalpel in a patient on anticoagulation is described. CASE: A 21-year-old female with bicollis didelphys uterus and a 4-cm vaginal septum underwent resection of the vaginal septum using the ultrasonic scalpel. Hemostasis was noted both during and after the procedure. The patient was given thombophylaxis for 2 weeks perioperatively secondary to her medical history of anti-thrombin III deficiency and deep venous thrombosis. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: The use of the Harmonic Scalpel appears to be a safe and effective method for resection of vaginal septa. Patient healing time may vary and may take longer than with traditional techniques.
