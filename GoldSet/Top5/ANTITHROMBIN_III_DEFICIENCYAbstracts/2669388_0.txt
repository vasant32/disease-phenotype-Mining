Within two prospective controlled clinical studies in the clinic and outpatient department for orthopaedics of the Erfurt Medical Academy in the period from 1980 to 1985 on 437 patients with alloarthroplasties of the hip examinations with various medicaments concerning the frequency of thromboembolic diseases were carried out. By means of haemostaseologic investigations could be confirmed that fibrinolytic defects could be removed in the majority of cases by the treatment with dehydrochlormethyl testosterone. This form of the treatment and the combination low-dose heparin and dihydroergotamine as medicamentous prophylaxis showed the best effect. The analyses of the haemostaseologic investigations only conditionedly allow a statement about the fact whether in the individual case there is a readiness for thrombosis.
