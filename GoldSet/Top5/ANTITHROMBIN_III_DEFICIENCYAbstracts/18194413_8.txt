 BACKGROUND: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a complication of treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children but little is known about the long-term outcomes of these DVT. Objective: To determine the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in (i) children with ALL diagnosed with asymptomatic DVT using radiographic testing and (ii) an unselected group of ALL survivors. METHODS: Cross-sectional study in two populations. Group I comprised children in the Prophylactic Antithrombin Replacement in Kids with ALL treated with L-Asparaginase (PARKAA) study diagnosed with DVT by radiographic tests. Group II consisted of non-selected childhood ALL survivors <21 years. PTS was assessed using a standardized scoring sheet. RESULTS: Group I: 13 PARKAA patients (median age 12 years) were assessed, and 7 had PTS (54%; 95% CI, 25-81). All patients had collaterals, three also had increased arm circumference. Group II: 41 patients (median age 13 years) with a history of ALL were enrolled, and 10 had PTS (24%; 95% CI, 11-38). All patients had collaterals; five also had increased arm circumference. CONCLUSION: There is a high incidence of PTS in survivors of childhood ALL with radiographically diagnosed asymptomatic DVT. A significant proportion of ALL survivors develop PTS, indicating previously undiagnosed DVT.
