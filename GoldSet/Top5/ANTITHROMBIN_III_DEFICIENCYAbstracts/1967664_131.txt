A patient with the short-gut syndrome and antithrombin III deficiency underwent small bowel and liver grafting a year ago. Transient, mild graft-versus-host disease and intestinal rejection occurred within 2 months of grafting and were easily managed. Parenteral nutrition was discontinued 8 weeks after surgery. The patient has maintained normal nutritional indices while on an unrestricted oral diet. Small-bowel/liver grafting is feasible for patients with the short-gut syndrome and associated liver disorders. Further experience is needed to determine the specific risks, benefits, and general applicability of this procedure.
