OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that in patients under age 50, with a first, arterial, ischemic cerebral infarct, whose family history and medical history do not suggest an inherited coagulation inhibitor deficiency, the yield of a laboratory search for these disorders will be low. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 55 such patients under age 50, we systematically searched for deficiencies of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III. RESULTS: No abnormalities of protein C or antithrombin III were found. One patient had a deficiency of protein S, which was most likely acquired rather than inherited. CONCLUSIONS: In patients who lack clinical features of a prothrombotic state, the yield of testing for protein C, S and AT III deficiency is likely to be low.
