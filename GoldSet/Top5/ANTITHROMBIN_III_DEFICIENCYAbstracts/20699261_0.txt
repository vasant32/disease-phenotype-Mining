Peripheral gangrene is rare in children. Protein C, protein S, and antithrombin deficiency, positivity for anticardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant and factor V Leiden mutation are important causes of thrombosis in the venous system. There is paucity of literature on the contribution of these factors in children with peripheral gangrene. We evaluated the role of aforementioned factors in children with peripheral gangrene. Protein S deficiency was seen in one case and another was transiently positive for lupus anticoagulant. None of the 11 age- and sex-matched normal controls had protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency. Our results indicate that deficiency of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin, and positivity for anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and factor V Leiden are uncommon causes of peripheral gangrene in children in north-western India. Fibrinolytic and antiplatelet parameters were not tested. Testing for these may yield further clues to the etiology of this condition.
