A study is presented which was carried out in twenty-five patients operated on in a surgical service, and who received total parenteral nutrition. Samples were taken to check modifications to the fibrinolytic system occurring after administration of hyperosmotic solutions, principally lipidic emulsions, from a contemporary standpoint. We performed three extractions: on day one, day five and following the withdrawal of the fat emulsion, with study of modifications to antithrombin III, alpha 2 antiplasmin, plasminogen, C protein, plasminogen tissular activator (t-PA), plasminogen tissular activator inhibitor (PAI 1), fibrinogen, and fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products. The laboratory techniques used are shown, along with the results obtained: increased for alpha 2 antiplasmin and antigenic t-PA with significant values (p < 0.05) on the day of withdrawal in comparison with pre-PN values, plus increased values for plasminogen, fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products and t-PA activity. In conclusion, it is suggested that antithrombin III deficiency, along with reduction in C protein levels and increased fibrinogen and PAI 1 concentration predispose patients with t-PA release defects to thrombo-embolic complication.
