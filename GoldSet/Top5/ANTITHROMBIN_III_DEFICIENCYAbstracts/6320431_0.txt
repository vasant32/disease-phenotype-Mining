The authors report their experience with 45 cases of inferior vena cava thrombosis. Diagnosis was delayed for an average of 55 days. One-third of cases were revealed by an embolic complication. Inflammatory diseases were the most common causes (Behcet disease: seven cases, systemic lupus erythematosus: 5 cases). Malignancies accounted for 20% of cases. Abnormalities of coagulation were uncommon: antithrombin III deficiency in one patient and protein C deficiency in another. Estrogen-progestogen combinations could be incriminated in 4 cases. Outcome was fatal in 20% of cases, usually as a result of the underlying disease. Functional status was good in two-thirds of patients without malignancy followed up for an average of 27 months. In 14 patients a clip was inserted to ensure total (3 cases) or partial (11 cases) interruption of vena cava blood flow because of a free thrombus and/or recurrent pulmonary embolism. Three patients had thrombectomy. After clip insertion two embolisms were recorded, one of which occurred in the immediate post-operative period.
