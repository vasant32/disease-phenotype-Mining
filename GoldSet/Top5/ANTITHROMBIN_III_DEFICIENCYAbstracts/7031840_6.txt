The catabolism of purified radiolabelled antithrombin III (AT III) concentrate was studied in two normals and two patients with congenital AT III deficiency both alone and combined with warfarin. The radiolabelling with iodine monochloride did not change the quality of the concentrate. The half-life varied between 3.4 and 4.8 days. No difference between normals and patients with congenital deficiency in non-acute stage could be observed in the catabolic parameters; nor was there any influence with warfarin.
