Long-term warfarin therapy was changed to subcutaneous heparin to cover a planned pregnancy in a patient with congenital antithrombin III (AT III) deficiency. Satisfactory anticoagulation was easily maintained in spite of low levels of biologically active AT III. Delivery and the puerperium were covered by a reduced dose of heparin and alternate day infusions of AT III concentrate. A mean dose of 0.77 U/kg of AT III concentrate produced a rise of 1% in AT III and the half-life was of the order of 24 h, with no evidence of increased consumption during labour and delivery. Pregnancy and labour were uncomplicated and resulted in delivery of a healthy female infant. The importance of early and adequate anticoagulation during pregnancy is emphasized.
