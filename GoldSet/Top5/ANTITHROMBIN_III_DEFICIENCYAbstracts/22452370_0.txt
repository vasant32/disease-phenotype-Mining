 PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence of thrombophilic disorders in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) women with history of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was carried out in 184 women with history of RPL, of which 92 of them were diagnosed with PCOS and 92 patients were without known PCOS. The prevalence of thrombophilic disorders was compared between the two mentioned groups. RESULTS: According to the findings, 70.7% of PCOS women with history of RPL had thrombophilic disorders. The prevalence of protein C deficiency was significantly higher in PCOS group compared to the non-PCOS group (21.7% vs. 10.9%, p = 0.04). There was a trend toward higher prevalence of protein S deficiency in PCOS group compared to the control group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (23.9% vs. 13%, p = 0.05). The prevalence of other thrombophilic disorders such as antithrombin III deficiency, homocysteine elevation, antiphospholipid antibody and Factor V Leiden was comparable between groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of thrombophilic disorders was more common in PCOS women than the normal group. The protein C deficiency is associated with PCOS in women with history of RPL. There was a trend toward higher prevalence of protein S deficiency in PCOS women, which needs further study.
