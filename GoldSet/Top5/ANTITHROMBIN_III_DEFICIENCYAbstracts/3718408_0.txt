This article deals with the clinical importance of antithrombin III (AT III) in renal disease. Patients with nephrotic syndrome demonstrates a high risk of thromboembolism. A renal AT III loss is an important pathogenetic factor in these events. Patients with serumalbumin below 2.0 g/dl are mostly endangered. In patients with acute oligoanuric renal failure low AT III-levels due to consumption were often found that lead to diminished protection against intravascular coagulation processes and can therefore contribute to progression of illness. An AT III-substitution may be of some benefit in these patients. Additionally AT III was given in patients with dialysis-dependent renal failure and low levels of AT III leading to a reduced incidence of thrombosis of the extracorporeal system. Unnecessary high doses were also avoided and a minimal heparinization could be performed more efficiently in bleeding risk patients. Furthermore, AT III-levels during renal transplantation and during organ rejection are reported.
