In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) both a haemorrhagic diathesis and a tendency to thrombosis of the venous and arterial vessels can be observed. In the course of the disease, thrombosis of the leg or pelvic veins developed in 20 per cent of 188 patients. The levels of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor, plasminogen, fibronectin and of factor VIII complex were increased in patients with SLE compared with a control group. Fifty per cent of the patients showed no increase in fibrinolytic activity after venous occlusion measured with the fibrin plate method. This suggests a reduced fibrinolytic capacity in SLE probably caused by alteration of the endothelial cells through immune complex vasculitis. In addition, the lupus anticoagulant and an acquired antithrombin III deficiency in nephrotic syndrome in SLE are to be considered thrombophilic mechanisms. In the individual case there is an overlapping of hyper- and hypocoagulability.
