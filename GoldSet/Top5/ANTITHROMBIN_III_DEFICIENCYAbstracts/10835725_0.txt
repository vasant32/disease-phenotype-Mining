We report a 24 years old female with a Superior Mesenteric and Portal Vein Thrombosis due to an Antithrombin III factor deficiency, associated to oral contraceptive use and smoking. She presented with severe abdominal pain and the diagnosis was reached after surgery with a CT scan. The patient was treated with intravenous heparin and oral anticoagulation, with a good clinical and Doppler endo-sonographic response. One month after the onset, she developed an intestinal occlusion caused by two concentric jejunal stenoses, measuring 2 and 0.7 cm in length and demonstrated with a barium jejunogram. A 35 cm intestinal resection was done and the patient recovered uneventfully. The pathological study showed granulation tissue on both stenotic zones with an ulcer near to the distal stricture, that reached the internal muscularis propria, with subserosal fibrosis. The development of segmental stenosis is a rare complication superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, that must be bore in mind.
