An 8-year retrospective review of Indiana University Hospital records consisting of any patient age 18 to 40 years old who presented with arterial mesenteric ischemia was performed. Three patients were identified that met our criteria. The first patient was discovered to have a protein C deficiency. The second patient was afflicted with afibrinoginemia, a protein C and an antithrombin III deficiency. The third patient had been previously diagnosed with Takayasu's arteritis and had an elevated ESR. Each patient had a protracted course of symptoms before mesenteric disease was considered, confirmed by angiography, and treated by arterial bypass with/without bowel resection. All patients survived and are currently asymptomatic at an average of 2 years postoperatively. Mesenteric ischemia in patients under the age of 40, especially in the absence of cocaine use, is rare and often causes a delay in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The high incidence of hypercoagulable states in our study cases suggests the need for a search for such disorders and the possible need for long-term anticoagulation therapy as a deterrent to recurrence.
