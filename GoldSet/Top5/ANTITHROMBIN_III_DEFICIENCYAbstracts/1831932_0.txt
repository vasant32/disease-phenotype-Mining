Studies of blood fibrinolytic activity in 112 patients with repeated acute myocardial infarction or injury to the myocardium have revealed reduced fibrinolytic activity on non-heated fibrin plates, decreased plasmin activity and euglobulin+ fraction lysis, lowered levels of plasminogen activator, total nonenzymic fibrinolysis, antithrombin III, ++FFDP, and elevated soluble complexes of fibrin-monomer level. Complications of myocardial infarction presenting as thromboembolism; ciliary arrhythmia, chronic aneurysm with thrombosis are associated with still more marked disorders of the fibrinolysis system.
