 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the maternal and fetal outcome in a cohort of women undergoing a subsequent pregnancy after a previous cerebrovascular event in the presence of thrombophilia. PATIENTS: Fifteen pregnancies were followed up in 12 women with past cerebrovascular events and thrombophilic disorders. The cerebrovascular events occurred during a previous pregnancy in five patients. Six patients had a bad obstetric history including intrauterine fetal death in four cases, early onset of severe preeclampsia in two cases and one infant that was small for gestational age. THE THROMBOPHILIC DISORDERS INCLUDED: anti-phospholipid syndrome, protein C, S or antithrombin III deficiencies, mutations of the methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). All patients received prophylactic treatment with low molecular weight heparin and low dose aspirin. RESULTS: Thromboembolic complications occurred in four pregnancies. Postpartum complications occurred in one patient; deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli after stopping anticoagulation treatment. No patient had long-term neurologic damage. All pregnancies except one resulted in live births. (mean gestational age at delivery 36 +/- 3. 7 weeks, mean birth weight 2656 +/- 811 g). The one remaining pregnancy was electively terminated. There was one neonatal death due to the complications of severe prematurity in a woman with severe HELLP syndrome. CONCLUSION: This preliminary data suggests that women with a history of cerebrovascular events and thrombophilic disorders receiving prophylactic treatment, have a relatively favorable pregnancy outcome; however, they remain at significant risk during pregnancy. Further studies are necessary to determine the optimal prophylactic treatment.
