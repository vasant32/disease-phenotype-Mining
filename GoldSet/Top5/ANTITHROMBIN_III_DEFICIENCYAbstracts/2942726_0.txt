Blood coagulation and fibrinolysis characteristics are described in children whose fathers survived myocardial infarction when fairly young. Hemostatic and fibrinolytic effects of heredity are analysed, as are lipid spectrum disorders. Children with aggravated heredity showed changes in plasma fibrinogen concentration, antithrombin III, total plasma fibrinolytic activity recalcification time. The monitoring of children with aggravated heredity for coronary heart disease, particularly those with attendant dyslipoproteinemia as a specific high-risk group, is proposed.
