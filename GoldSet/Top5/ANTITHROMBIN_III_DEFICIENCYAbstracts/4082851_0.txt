Hypercoagulation caused by decreased antithrombin III level leads to thrombosis inspite of postoperative prophylactic heparin therapy. Induced low level of antithrombin III is recognised in particular diseases which lead to a reduced ATIII synthesis, high breakdown or loss. Induced forms should be substituted with ATIII transfusions. Congenital forms should be treated lifelong with coumarin derivates. One should always suspect an ATIII deficiency when in spite of full heparin dosage a prolonged plasma thrombin time is not attained. A case history of recurrent thrombosis may also point to such deficiency.
