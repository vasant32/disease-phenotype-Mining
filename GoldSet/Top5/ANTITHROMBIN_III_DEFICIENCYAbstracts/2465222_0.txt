Induced by the case of a blood-donor with more than 100 donations-mostly apheresis-who suffered acute thromboembolism caused by antithrombin III depletion, nearly 60 apheresis-donors were examined before, during and after aphereses, as well manual fourfold as computerized (CS-3000 TRAVENOL) cytaphereses with special methods of coagulation, mainly antithrombin III levels and fibrin-monomeres. The findings were described and compared, multifold in manual techniques happened breaks caused by occluded tubules were accompanied with decrease of antithrombin III and positive FM-tests. It was discussed, if apheresis-techniques for themselves (extracorporal multifold manipulation in manual techniques and contact with artificial surfaces in both kinds of techniques) can be the reason for a hypercoagulation. It seems to be important, how is the situation of apheresis-donor before starting, therefore we give the recommendation, to pay more attention in examination this kind of donors, additional with testing antithrombin III levels and tests for fibrin-monomers.
