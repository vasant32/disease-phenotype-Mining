The activity of AT III was measured by chromogenous substrates in 18 of 28 patients before, between and after liver transplantation. In half of all cases basic pathological activities could be observed. During transplantation, AT III is on an average decreased to 43% of the initial level. Examples are demonstrated for important AT III deficiencies after liver transplantation in man. Long-time examinations have shown AT III to be in the normal range or higher in 1 to 60 months after transplantation when the graft function is correct.
