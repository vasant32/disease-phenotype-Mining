Monitoring of AT III values and, if necessary, replacement therapy, are particularly important during the peri- and postoperative phase, or after multiple trauma, in order to prevent thromboembolic complications especially in operations on the liver, or when using heart-lung machines and in shock and pronounced DIC. AT III deficiency is partly dependent on the type and severity of the disorder with the resultant increased in turnover and partly on the synthesis capacity of the liver. Life-threatening complications can be prevented by AT III replacement.
