Using the chromogenic substrate S-2222, we have optimized and automated an amidolytic assay for heparin. The assay is based on the detection of anti-Xa activity generated by heparin in plasma. The method is reproducible (intra- and interassay CVs of 2.4 and 3.3%, respectively) and reliable in antithrombin III-deficient plasma. Results of this assay, obtained for plasma samples from patients and volunteers treated with heparin, correlate well (r = 0.899) with those of the test for activated partial thromboplastin time. Upon administration of a low-Mr heparinoid (Org 10172) and heparin fragment ( Kabi 2165), however, the activated partial thromboplastin time failed to detect anticoagulant activity, whereas the chromogenic heparin assay revealed anti-Xa activity. This automated amidolytic assay for heparin is therefore suitable not only for monitoring standard therapy with heparin but also for measuring the activity of recently developed heparin fractions.
