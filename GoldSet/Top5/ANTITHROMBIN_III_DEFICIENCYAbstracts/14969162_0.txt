We have analyzed the prothrombotic risk factors in 124 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) as compared with control subjects with other gastrointestinal disorders. The patients were hospitalized from 1991 to 2000 in the Department of Internal Medicine. Platelets level was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in UC patients as compared with control group, and aPTT was significantly (p < 0.05) prolonged respectively in UC patients as compared with control group. In the prospective pilot study we observed the decrease of plasma antithrombin level and/or decrease of protein S in approximately 22% of UC patients. The plasma protein C activity was normal in all UC patients, whereas the mean level of protein S was significantly lower (p < 0.02) in UC patients as compared with controls. Thus our data indicate that coagulation abnormalities are potential risk factors of thromboembolic complications in UC. Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were above upper limit of normal values in 38% and 18% UC patients respectively, but mean values of both parameters were not significantly different between UC and control group. Our results suggest that plasma lipid changes are not independent risk factor of vascular complication in UC. In UC patients smokers were observed 4 times less than no-smokers. However, positive correlation between smoking and rise of hematocrit (F = 4.48; p < 0.05) in UC suggests that smoking may be a risk factor of vascular complications in the disease. Thromboembolic events were found in 1.6% of UC patients. In addition, chronic coronary heart disease was accompanied approximately 6% of UC patients. Evaluation of prothrombotic risk factors and associated ischaemic heart diseases may have prognostic value in the management of UC.
