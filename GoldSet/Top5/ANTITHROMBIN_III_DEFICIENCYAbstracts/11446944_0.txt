Antithrombin III (AT III) deficiency is a rare hereditary disease that predisposes a patient to thromboembolic complications. Anticoagulation is essential for preventing recurrence of thrombi. Concentrated AT III replacement is reserved for acute periods of thromboembolism or moments of increased risk. Hemostatic anomalies are generally considered a contraindication for regional anesthesia, due to the potential risk of spinal hematoma. This paper describes a woman with congenital AT III deficiency and heparin-treated pulmonary embolism whose pregnancy of 29 weeks had to be terminated by cesarean section upon signs of fetal distress. We discuss the pathophysiology and treatment in such cases.
