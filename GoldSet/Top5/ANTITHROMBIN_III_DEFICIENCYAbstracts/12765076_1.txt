Testicular infarction without torsion of the spermatic cord is a rare lesion, generally idiopathic and spontaneous. It may be exceptionally associated with certain risk factors (vasculitis, cholesterol emboli, malakoplakia, protein S or antithrombin III deficiency, etc.). It often simulates testicular tumour, leading to orchidectomy, which can be avoided, particularly in the case of segmental infarction, by applying conservative treatment. The authors report an original case of infarction of an inguinal ectopic testis without torsion. No cause was identified. In the light of this case and a review of the literature, the authors discuss the various aspects of this clinical entity.
