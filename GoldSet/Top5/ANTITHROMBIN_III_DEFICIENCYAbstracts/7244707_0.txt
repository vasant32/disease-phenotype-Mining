A 41-year-old woman has had a long history of repeated episodes of recurrent painful ecchymotic lesions. Results of coagulation tests were normal other than a slight decrease in antithrombin III. Skin tests were positive in response to the patient's own washed red cells. Light and electron microscopy of both the spontaneous and the induced lesions showed nonspecific changes but failed to reveal immunologic vasculitis. Psychologic evaluation showed hysterical and masochistic traits, depression, anxiety, and inability to deal appropriately with hostile impulses. Placebo was successful on several occasions in controlling or modifying the severity of the ecchymotic lesions.
