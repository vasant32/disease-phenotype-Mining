Primary hypercoagulable states are increasingly recognized as causes of venous and arterial thromboembolism in surgical patients. Herein, we describe 10 patients with this syndrome who were diagnosed during a recent 1-year period. A family history and past medical history of thromboembolism and an unusual site of thrombosis are emphasized for accurate diagnosis. Although antithrombin III deficiencies were the most common abnormality found, we describe three patients with hypofibrinolytic syndromes and increased levels of tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor. The effectiveness of anticoagulation therapy in preventing recurrent thromboembolism is stressed.
