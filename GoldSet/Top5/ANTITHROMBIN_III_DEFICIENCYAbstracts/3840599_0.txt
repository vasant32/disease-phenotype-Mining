Because of their gravity and the complications involved, repeated deep venous thromboses require everything to be done to produce an aetiological diagnosis, for only this will make a preventive treatment possible. Amongst causes of phlebitis, haemostatic disorders and coagulation factor anomaly should be systematically looked for, as these can sometimes be corrected. Following the discovery of the Antithrombin III deficiency, the protein C deficiency shows clear progress along these lines. The author here describes two cases of the protein C deficiency in patients who have suffered repeated deep and superficial venous thrombosis, with thromboembolic family antecedents.
