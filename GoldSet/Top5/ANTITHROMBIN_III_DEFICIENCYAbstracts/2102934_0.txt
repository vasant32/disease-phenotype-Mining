Antithrombin deficit may be a cause of spontaneous vascular thrombosis or rethrombosis, following vascular operations, which remain inexplicable to clinicians. Three cases are reported of A III deficit, in two of whom vascular rethrombosis resulted from considerable fall in A III activity, measured by kinetic method and in the third patient this severe postoperative complication was averted. The importance of measuring A III in patients with arterial insufficiency in whom vascular reconstruction is forthcoming is discussed. The substituting therapy in patients with this pathology and arterial reconstruction is given due consideration. Substituting therapy is recommended as means for avoiding rethrombosis in patients with proven A III deficit, as well as a method of treatment, together with heparin therapy, after successful reoperation of such patients.
