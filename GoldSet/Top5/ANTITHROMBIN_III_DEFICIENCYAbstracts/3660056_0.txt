We have reported a case of recurrent primary mesenteric venous thrombosis resulting in small bowel infarction. Resection of necrotic bowel, anastomosis, and postoperative anticoagulation remain the cornerstone of management. Delay in diagnosis and treatment contributes to the high mortality. A history of peripheral thrombosis, antithrombin III deficiency, hypovolemia, or carcinoma in susceptible patients with abdominal pain should arouse suspicion of ischemic bowel.
