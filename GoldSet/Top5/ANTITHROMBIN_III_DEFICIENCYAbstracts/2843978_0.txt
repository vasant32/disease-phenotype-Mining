A 19-year old male patient with hereditary antithrombin III type I deficiency was admitted for thrombosis of the right iliac, femoral and popliteal veins. Treatment with a low molecular weight heparin resulted in recanalization of the veins confirmed by phlebography. After two weeks of treatment, the drug was replaced by another low molecular weight heparin and this was followed, 3 weeks later, by a documented relapse of thrombosis.
