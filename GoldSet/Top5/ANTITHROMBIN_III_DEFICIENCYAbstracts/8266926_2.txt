This is a four-year prospective study on patients admitted or referred with thromboembolic disease to Jordan University Hospital or to the Thrombosis/Haemostasis Laboratory at the University of Jordan. The aim of the study was to find the relative prevalence of hereditary thrombophilia. For the purpose of this work, hereditary thrombophilia was diagnosed in the absence of an acquired cause of thrombophilia in addition to two of the following: 1) positive family history of thrombophilia, 2) confirmed same deficiency in a closely related family member, 3) the deficient protein is constantly below 2 SD of the normal mean on repeated testing. All ages were admitted to the study. Acquired systemic factors or local factors known to cause thrombosis or affect the levels of proteins opposing thrombosis were excluded. There were a total of 217 patients (102 males and 115 females) with confirmed thromboembolic disease. Their mean age was 34 years. A total of 49 patients (26 males and 23 females) fulfilled the criteria of hereditary thrombophilia. There were 17 cases of protein C deficiency (PC), 15 protein S deficiency (PS), 10 antithrombin III deficiency (ATIII), 3 dyfibrinogenemia, 2 heparin cofactor II deficiency, and 2 plasminogen defects. In this group most of the thrombosis was venous. A positive family history was obtained in 65.3% of patients with hereditary thrombophilia. Twenty-seven additional relatives with deficiency were identified upon family studies. The calculated prevalence of hereditary thrombophilia in Jordan is put at 1/25,000. Screening for PC, PS, and ATIII is advocated in young patients who have thromboembolic disease, especially when there is a positive family history of thrombosis.
