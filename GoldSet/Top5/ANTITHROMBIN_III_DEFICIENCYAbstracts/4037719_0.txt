Data collected in a study of ATIII deficiency also suggested familial variability of blood clotting times amongst genotypically normal individuals. A study of this variability under a variety of models demonstrates a clear age effect and within sibship similarity. There is also a clear parental effect, which could be either environmental or genetic. Even when parental effects are taken into account there remains some excess similarity between sibs, but the increase in log-likelihood provided by this component is no longer highly significant.
