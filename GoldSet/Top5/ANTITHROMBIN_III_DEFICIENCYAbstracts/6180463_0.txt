We report here preliminary results of a study comparing the effect of Hemoclar and antithrombin III (AT III) in a patient with an AT III congenital deficiency. Both drugs inhibit thrombin generation in the patient's plasma. Unlike AT III, Hemoclar also inhibits factor Xa generation. This led us to propose the use of Hemoclar, which acts via an AT III independent pathway, to prevent thrombosis in A III deficient patients.
