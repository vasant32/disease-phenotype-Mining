The influence of antithrombin III on hemostasis and renal function was studied in experiments on rats with nephrotic syndrome. The development of nephrotic syndrome was accompanied by the activation of blood coagulation and appearance of acquired antithrombin III deficiency due to its loss with the urine. The replacement therapy by bovine antithrombin III at a dose of 25 U/kg a day for 10 days decreased the signs of excessive thrombinogenesis in experimental animals and increased the amount of thrombin-antithrombin III complexes in the blood flow. The activation of coagulation in rats with nephrotic syndrome predominantly induced the disturbances of the excretory renal function which could be efficiently corrected by antithrombin III.
