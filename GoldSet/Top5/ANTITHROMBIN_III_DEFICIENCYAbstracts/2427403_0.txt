In 53 patients suffering from recurrent thrombosis various hemostaseological parameters were investigated. In 91 per cent of the patients spontaneous fibrinolytic activity was decreased. Decreased or lacking activity of the fibrinolytic system following venous occlusion was found in 48 per cent. In most cases, the concentration of alpha 2-macroglobulin was reduced. This was most pronounced in patients with antithrombin III deficiency. In nearly all cases the concentration of alpha 2-antiplasmin was enhanced. Prospective long-term studies on the importance of defective fibrinolysis are required.
