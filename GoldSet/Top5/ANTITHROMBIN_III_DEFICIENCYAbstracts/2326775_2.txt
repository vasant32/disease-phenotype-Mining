A patient with a superior sagittal sinus thrombosis (SSST) which occurred during the postpartum period is reported. Coagulation studies revealed persistently decreased antithrombin III (AT III) activity. Studies of AT III activity in her family revealed a hereditary AT III deficiency. Since AT III activity was normal in the grandparents of the propositus, the disorder in this family appears to be due to a spontaneous mutation occurring in the mother of the propositus.
