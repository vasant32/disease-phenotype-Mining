Several indices of coagulation and fibrinolysis were studied in 54 patients suffering from Sch√∂nlein-Henoch disease. A significant prolongation of platelet aggregation was found in parallel with a decrease of AT III and plasminogen and an increase of the fibrin monomer complexes. Consequent to heparin treatment controlled by measurements of residual thrombin activity, the indices showed a trend towards normalization. The dynamic monitoring of the above indices can be used for an overall assessment of the heparin treatment.
