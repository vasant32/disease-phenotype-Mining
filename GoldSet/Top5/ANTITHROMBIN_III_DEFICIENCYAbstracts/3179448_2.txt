Antithrombin III (ATIII) Northwick Park is caused by a single amino acid substitution, Arg 393---Cys and antithrombin III Glasgow is caused by Arg 393----His. Examination of the genetic code and the sequence of normal antithrombin III revealed that these amino acid substitutions could arise from the substitution of either two nucleotides or a single nucleotide at codon 393 of the antithrombin III gene. In two families, detection of the ATIII variants by genetic linkage analysis was not possible owing to lack of informative RFLP markers. Consequently, we synthesized two 22-base-long oligonucleotides specific for the single-base substitutions in the region of codon 393 and demonstrated by oligonucleotide hybridization that the molecular defect of ATIII Northwick Park is caused by the CGT----TGT mutation at codon 393 and that ATIII Glasgow is caused by the CGT----CAT mutation at codon 393. These oligonucleotide probes should prove useful as an alternative method for early detection of the ATIII variants.
