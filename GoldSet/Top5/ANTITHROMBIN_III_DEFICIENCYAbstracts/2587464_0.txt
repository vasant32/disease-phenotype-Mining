Transfusion medicine is an expanding subspecialty that continues to be reshaped and redefined. The current indications for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion are the presence of tissue hypoxia or a hemoglobin level of less than 7 g/dL. Platelet concentrates should be given prophylactically for severe thrombocytopenia secondary to production defects. In the patient who is in need of an invasive procedure or is bleeding, therapeutic platelet transfusion may be needed if the platelet count is less than 50,000/microL or the bleeding time is twice the upper limit of normal or more. Both RBC and platelet transfusion should be avoided if specific therapy is available for the underlying condition. Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma is indicated for reversal of inherited isolated coagulation factor deficiencies, emergent reversal of the effects of warfarin sodium (Coumadin, Panwarfin, Sofarin), antithrombin III deficiency, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. No blood transfusion is without risk to the recipient. Two of the major transfusion-related complications are alloimmunization and graft-versus-host disease. Techniques for preventing these conditions are available.
