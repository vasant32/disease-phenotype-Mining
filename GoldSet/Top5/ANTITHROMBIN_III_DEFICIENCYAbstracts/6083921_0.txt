In 98 patients with arterial insufficiency of arteriosclerotic and diabetic genesis correlation analyses were carried out between total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, blood pressure, platelet counts, platelet function and antithrombin III. Besides the known relations between the parameters of lipid metabolism and blood pressure, correlations were found and analysed between antithrombin III, platelet function, renal function and between platelet counts and HDL cholesterol. The importance of the findings for the diagnosis of vascular insufficiency and the relation to normal values are discussed.
