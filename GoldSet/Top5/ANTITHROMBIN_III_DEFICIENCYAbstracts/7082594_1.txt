In 58 patients with phlebographically diagnosed deep vein thrombosis during oral contraception the extension and localization of the thrombotic process was analysed in relation to the coagulation and fibrinolytic system 6 months after thrombosis. Left-sided thrombi dominated and the thrombi were more extensive and proximal on the left side. This left-sided dominance was more apparent with higher oestrogen content in the pills. The right-sided thrombi more often were the source of pulmonary embolism. In 31% of the patients a defective fibrinolytic system was found; this defect was seen more often in patients with right-sided thrombi. Only very few defects were found in the coagulation system. No patients had an antithrombin III deficiency.
