Acute fatty liver (AFLP) is a rare complication of late pregnancy. The maternal and fetal mortality has earlier been reported to be about 75%, but during the last decade a reduced mortality to about 30 and 50%, respectively, has been reported in the literature. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been suggested as a contributing cause to the high mortality. The treatment of DIC has long been under debate, and recently the administration of antithrombin III (AT) concentrate in addition to other supportive treatment has been reported successful. This paper presents the survival of 1 patient with severe liver and renal failure indicating AFLP complicated by severe disturbances in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. The patient was treated with AT concentrate and small doses of heparin, blood coagulation factors, large amounts of glucose intravenously and supportive intensive care. The pregnancy was terminated by cesarean section. The child was stillborn and 75% of the placental parenchyma was fibrosed.
