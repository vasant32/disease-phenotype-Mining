Three patients with familial antithrombin III deficiency underwent a trial of prophylactic antithrombotic therapy with stanozolol. An increase in plasma fibrinolytic activity and antithrombin III was seen. Acute venous thrombosis occurred in two patients; in the first patient thrombosis was precipitated by venography but in the second no precipitating factor was found. Our experience suggests that stanozolol is not a suitable prophylactic agent in patients with familial antithrombin III deficiency.
