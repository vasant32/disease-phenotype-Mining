The levels of prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 were measured by a double antibody radioimmunoassay in blood samples collected into different anticoagulant solutions. We evaluated healthy males between the ages of 42 and 77, asymptomatic patients with hereditary deficiencies of protein C or protein S, and persons receiving tumor necrosis factor infusions. The results in specimens collected in an anticoagulant containing ACD, EDTA, adenosine, and 25 U/ml of heparin (a) were highly correlated with those collected in an anticoagulant containing a synthetic thrombin inhibitor, EDTA, and aprotinin (b). However, in asymptomatic patients with congenital antithrombin III deficiency, we found that the plasma levels of F1 + 2 in blood collected in anticoagulant (a) were usually substantially higher than those collected in anticoagulant (b). We determined that this phenomenon was not attributable to the venipuncture procedure itself, but rather appears to be due to the action of low concentrations of heparin in the presence of reduced blood levels of antithrombin III. Our data show that the previously documented elevations in plasma F1 + 2 levels in patients with congenital antithrombin III deficiency appear to be caused by the above in vitro anticoagulant effect, and that this population does not exhibit evidence of a prethrombotic state as defined by the F1 + 2 assay.
