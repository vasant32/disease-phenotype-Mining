The basic mechanisms responsible for equilibrium impairment in the hemostatic system in pulmonary tuberculosis patients are reduced activity of antithrombin III and disturbances of platelet functional capacities. These changes were proved to reflect the course of intravascular hemocoagulation whose degree of manifestation is related directly to the extent of specific lesions in the lungs and intoxication phenomena. The process of intravascular hemocoagulation in tuberculosis patients runs in the presence of an increased concentration of plasma fibronectin , while major surgery performed in patients with fibrous-cavernous processes leads to its reduced level. It is pathogenetically proved to use antithrombin III concentrate preparations with anti- and dysaggregatory properties, fibronectin preparations, trasylol or its analogs during complex preoperative preparation of patients.
