A previous study in this laboratory showed that depolymerized holothurian glycosaminoglycan (DHG) has two different antithrombin III (ATIII)-independent inhibitory effects on the in vitro blood coagulation system: heparin cofactor II (HCII)-dependent inhibition of thrombin, and ATIII- and HCII-independent inhibition of factor X activation by factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex (Nagase et al. Blood 85, 1527-1534, 1995). In the present study, we compared the antithrombotic effects of DHG in normal and in ATIII-deficient mice with those of unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). DHG, unlike UFH and LMWH, exerted an in vivo antithrombotic effect even in mice with decreased plasma ATIII activity (about 30% of normal). We then compared the anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects of DHG in mice with those of high molecular weight (HMW)-DHG, low molecular weight (LMW)-DHG, and dermatan sulfate (DS). In terms of in vitro anticoagulant activity assessed by use of purified human components, DHGs (DHG, HMW-DHG, and LMW-DHG) had different anti-thrombin activity in the presence of HCII and anti-factor Xase activities, which differences were dependent on the molecular weight. With respect to in vivo antithrombotic activity, DHG, HMW-DHG, and LMW-DHG showed almost the same inhibitory effect on acute thromboembolism in mice (minimum effective dose [MED]: > 0.3 mg/kg). Since the antithrombotic activities of DHGs were not correlated with the anticoagulant-specific activities, the contribution of the two anticoagulant activities to the in vivo antithrombotic effect of DHGs remains unknown. However, DHG was more effective against acute thromboembolism in mice than DS (MED > 1 or > 3 mg/kg), which showed no inhibitory activity toward factor Xase. Therefore, it seems that factor Xase inhibition contributes greatly to the antithrombotic effect of DHG and that DHG exerts this effect in mice mainly by inhibiting factor Xase.
