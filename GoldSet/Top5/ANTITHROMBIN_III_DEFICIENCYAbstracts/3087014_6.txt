Factors affecting the inhibition of tissue thromboplastin (TP)-mediated blood coagulation have been investigated. Human brain thromboplastin progressively loses procoagulant activity when incubated in the presence of defibrinated plasma and CaCl2. Inhibition is maximal at a CaCl2 concentration of 1.5 mM during incubation and involves the calcium dependent binding of a plasma component(s) to the TP-FVII complex, preventing the activation of FX. Chelation of calcium ions using EDTA releases active TP and FVII from the inhibited complex. No inhibition occurs during incubation of TP with Al (OH)3 adsorbed plasma and calcium ions unless a Factor VII concentrate (or purified FVII and FX) is also present. Incubation of TP with antithrombin III-deficient plasma and calcium ions also leads to inhibition. Moreover, purified AT III cannot substitute for adsorbed plasma in producing TP inhibition. The data are consistent with the presence in plasma of a potent AT III independent inhibitor of TP-mediated blood coagulation.
