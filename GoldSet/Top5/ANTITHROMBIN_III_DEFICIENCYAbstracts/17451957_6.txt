We report 3 siblings (1 male and 2 female) recently diagnosed with congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ia (CDG-Ia) in their mid-20s. They experience mild mental retardation but manage to function independently in society. Their professions are library assistant, professional artistic painter and secretarial work. All three siblings have cerebellar hypoplasia and ataxia, but are able to ambulate easily. Two of the siblings have required strabismus surgical repairs. All have antithrombin III deficiency, osteoporosis, and mild dysmorphic features. Hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism was a feature of the two female siblings. A type 1 sialotransferrin pattern and phosphomannomutase (PMM) deficiency have been demonstrated. They are compound heterozygotes for R141H and L32R mutations in the PMM2 gene. While there is clinical heterogeneity in CDG-Ia, we believe that our patients are among the mildest of intellectually affected CDG-Ia patients reported to date.
