The possible etiologies of cerebral infarcts (CI) in young patients differ from those in the older stroke population. Recently, deficiencies of fibrinolytic factors emerged as an important etiology of stroke in the young population. The literature has emphasized the diagnosis of such conditions especially in stroke cases of undetermined etiology and with history of recurrent thrombosis. We carried out a research on the serum level of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III in young patients, between 15 and 40 years, with CI of undetermined cause after application of a standard protocol. Three patients had low levels of these proteins; two had protein C deficiency, and one protein S deficiency. None of them had antithrombin III deficiency. We conclude that systematic investigation of such causes of cerebral infarct will reduce the group of undetermined strokes, and will open the possibility of prophylactic treatment in a non-negligible group of patients.
