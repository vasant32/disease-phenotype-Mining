Neonatal dural sinus thrombosis is a relatively unknown disease. We recently diagnosed two newborn patients with dural sinus thrombosis. Both patients had associated conditions known to predispose to dural sinus thrombosis. One patient had severe perinatal asphyxia, and the other patient had a deficiency of antithrombin III. Both patients had severe neonatal seizures. The literature on some aspects of this entity is discussed. It is concluded that dural sinus thrombosis may represent an important and underrecognized cause of neonatal seizures.
