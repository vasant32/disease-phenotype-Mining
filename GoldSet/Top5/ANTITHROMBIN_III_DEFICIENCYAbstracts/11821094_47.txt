 OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of thrombophilia in women with idiopathic pregnancy loss. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center in a teaching academic hospital. PATIENT(S): One hundred forty-five patients with repeated pregnancy loss and 145 matched controls. INTERVENTION(S): Prospective assessment of thrombophilia in patients and controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Prevalence of activated protein C (APC) resistance, protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III deficiencies, antiphospholipid antibodies, factor V Leiden, factor II G20210A, and MTHFR C677T mutations. RESULT(S): At least one thrombophilic defect was found in 66% of study group patients compared with 28% in control group patients. Combined thrombophilic defects were documented in 21% of women with pregnancy loss compared with 5.5% of control patients. Late pregnancy wastage occurred more frequently in women with thrombophilia compared with women without thrombophilia (160/429 [37%] vs. 39/162 [24%], respectively). APC resistance was documented in 39% of women with pregnancy loss compared with 3% of the control patients. APC resistance without factor V Leiden mutation was documented in 18% of women with pregnancy loss compared with none of the controls. While factor V Leiden mutation was more common in women with pregnancy loss (25% vs. 7.6%), factor II G20210A and homozygosity for MTHFR C677T contributed to pregnancy loss only in the presence of other thrombophilia. CONCLUSION(S): Thrombophilia was found in the majority (66%) of women with idiopathic pregnancy loss. APC resistance with or without factor V Leiden mutation is the most common thrombophilic defect, and combined thrombophilia is a frequent finding in women with pregnancy loss. Thrombophilia is associated with increased frequency of late pregnancy wastage.
