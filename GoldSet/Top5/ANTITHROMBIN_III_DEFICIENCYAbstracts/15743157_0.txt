 BACKGROUND: Thrombophilia is defined as an altered hemostasis that predisposes to thrombosis. It can be primary when there is a family clustering of the disease or secondary, when it is associated to an acquired risk factor. AIM: To report clinical features in a series of patients with primary thrombophilia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of clinical records of patients with thrombotic episodes that lead to the suspicions of primary thrombophilia. Analysis of asymptomatic adult close relatives of these patients. RESULTS: We report 93 subjects (56 females, age range 14-77 years) with repeated episodes of thrombosis and a family history of thrombosis and 12 asymptomatic close relatives. Seventy one percent had the first thrombotic episode before the age of 40 years, 62% had more than one thrombotic episode and 37% had a family history of thrombosis. Twenty four percent had protein C deficiency, 24% had antithrombin III deficiency, 18% had resistance to activated C protein by factor V Leiden, 10% had protein S deficiency, and 10% had the G20210 mutation of prothrombin gene. Among acquired defects studied simultaneously, 30% had lupus anticoagulant and 11% had hyperhomocysteinemia. Twenty four percent of cases had more than one thrombophilic risk factor. Among asymptomatic relatives, five had factor V Leiden, four had protein C deficiency and three had the G20210 mutation of prothrombin gene. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombophilia must be suspected in young subjects with thrombotic episodes and a family history. The type of coagulation defect will determine prognosis, and the type of treatment.
