A patient with antithrombin III deficiency developed deep vein thrombosis during her first pregnancy. Her pregnancy and delivery were successfully treated with simultaneous administration of antithrombin III concentrates and low molecular weight heparin. She delivered a 2,412g girl at 39 weeks' gestation. The baby was administered with antithrombin III concentrates as prophylaxis for neonatal arterial and venous thrombosis because the antithrombin III level was extremely low to be 2%. Her second pregnancy was uneventful at 38 weeks' gestation, and she was treated with administration of antithrombin III concentrates prophylactically. She delivered a 3,256g boy at 42 weeks' gestation without any complications. The antithrombin III level of the second baby was normal. These results showed that in a neonate with congenital antithrombin III deficiency the antithrombin III concentrates would be administered to prevent neonatal arterial and venous thrombosis.
