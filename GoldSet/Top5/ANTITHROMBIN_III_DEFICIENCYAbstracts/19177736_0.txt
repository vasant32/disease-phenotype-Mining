Antithrombin is a plasma protein that regulates haemostasis by inhibiting procoagulant serine proteases. Hereditary antithrombin deficiency is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. The risk of vessel occlusion escalates especially during the pregnancy due to hyperestrogen condition both in the maternal and in foetal circulation. Our case report describes a 24-years old gipsy-woman with severe congenital AT deficiency and recurrent foetal loss in her history. She informed us about her 4th pregnancy in the 12th gestation week therefore warfarin treatment and regular checking up INR was recommended. We didn't have any information about the pregnancy course till the 41st gestation week. When the patient came to give birth, the entry INR value was 1.0. She has delivered a healthy male newborn by caesarean section. Two weeks after delivery when effective INR value due to peroral anticoagulant therapy was achieved, she was released from the hospital and since that we have not seen her.
