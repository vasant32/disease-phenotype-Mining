41 patients with hereditary and acquired antithrombin II deficiency received a substitution therapy with human plasma fraction of antithrombin III from the GDR blood-transfusion service. In 6 patients a hereditary AT III deficiency was substituted and in this context the substitution in case of thromboses during pregnancy was explained. 35 patients with acquired AT III deficiency were substituted with AT III concentrate because of thromboembolic complication in the macro-circulatory system in case of AT III deficiency due to reduced synthesis, loss, increased consumption or a combination of these conditions or because of DIC. The substitution effect was good. Dosage and injection intervals depend on the clinical condition. Side-effects have not been observed.
