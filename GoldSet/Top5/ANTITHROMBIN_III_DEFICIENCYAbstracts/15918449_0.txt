Although patients undergoing cardiac surgery often present with diverse comorbidities, those with coagulation derangements are especially challenging. The present report describes the management of a patient who presented with a Factor V Leiden mutation, lupus anticoagulant, and acquired activated protein C resistance. A 42-year-old female presented with acute shortness of breath and chest pain. She was otherwise healthy 1 month prior to admission when she presented with dysfunctional uterine bleeding, resulting in the transfusion of three units of packed red blood cells. Coagulation evaluation revealed that the patient had lupus anticoagulant, factor V Leiden mutation and an activated protein C resistance. The patient presented with an acute myocardial infarction and was found to have 90% stenosis of her left main coronary artery, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%. An emergent off-pump coronary artery bypass procedure with placement of a vein graft to the left anterior descending artery was completed. Intraoperative thrombophilia was encountered as evidenced by both an elevated thromboelastograph coagulation index (+3.6) and an acquired antithrombin-III deficiency. Postoperatively, the patient was placed on low molecular weight heparin, but developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and was switched to a direct thrombin inhibitor, argatroban. The following case report describes the coagulation management of this patient from the time of admission to discharge 43 days later, and the unique challenges this combination of hemostatic defects present to the clinicians.
