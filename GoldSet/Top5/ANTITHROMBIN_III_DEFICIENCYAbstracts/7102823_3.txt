Presented herein is a case report of a 20-year-old woman with a past history of oral contraceptive use who developed Budd-Chiari syndrome. Onset of her illness was abrupt and stormy, simulating fulminant viral hepatitis or toxic hepatic injury. She died within six months of her initial presentation. Although the patient discontinued the use of oral contraceptives two years prior to the initial presentation of the disease, the morphologic features of the venous thrombosis and hepatic damage were indicative of a chronic, ongoing process of longer than six months' duration, thus raising the possibility of a cause-effect relationship between the "pills" and thrombotic process. Of interest was the finding of persistently depressed antithrombin III levels. While a relationship between oral contraceptive usage, antithrombin III deficiency and the Budd-Chiari syndrome is strongly suggested in this case, prospective studies are needed to substantiate this view.
