We were able to carry out a study of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with the cooperation of clinicians. I herein describe a part of the study that I have conducted. Japanese patients with DVT were investigated regarding their incidences of antithrombin III (AT-III), protein C (PC), and protein S (PS) deficiencies, and the results were compared with those of normal subjects. We confirmed that the Japanese population has a high frequency of PC and PS deficiencies. Furthermore, we recommend that PS activity should be measured for the screening of thrombosis since type II deficiency accounted for approximately 50% of PS deficiency cases in both patients and the normal group in Japanese. We evaluated the reactivity of thrombin to TM by determining the TM-bound thrombin (TMBTh) to total thrombin generation (t-Th) ratio (TMBT ratio). We also examined whether a decreased TMBT ratio is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. The TMBT ratio (TMBTh/t-Th) was significantly lower in patients with DVT than in control subjects. These results suggest that it is possible to evaluate the reactivity of thrombin to TM by determining the TMBT ratio, and this ratio may be a predictor of deep vein thrombosis. However, we have yet to investigate the causal mechanism.
