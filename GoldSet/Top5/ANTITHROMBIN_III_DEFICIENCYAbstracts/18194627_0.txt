The development of deep vein thrombosis in an osteoarticular infection in children is rare. We report the case of two siblings with an osteoarticular infection in the hip and in the knee, respectively, who developed deep vein thrombosis and, in one sibling, pulmonary thromboembolism. The only hematological alteration found was reduction of anti-thrombin III in both patients. This reduction was acquired and secondary to sepsis due to Staphylococcus aureus. Anti-thrombin III levels recovered after 2 weeks of treatment. The association of deep vein thrombosis and osteoarticular infection with sepsis should lead to suspicion of hematological deficiencies, including acquired anti-thrombin III deficiency.
