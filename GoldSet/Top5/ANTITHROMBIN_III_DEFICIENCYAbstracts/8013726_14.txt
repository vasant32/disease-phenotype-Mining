The aetiology of non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy (ION) is multifactorial with local anatomical and systemic haemodynamic abnormalities both playing a role. A careful search for treatable vascular disease risk factors is required to allow rational therapy, to optimise the visual prognosis and to allow new insights into pathogenesis. We describe 7 cases in which there was an associated thrombophilic (prothrombotic) state; 4 had deficiencies of the physiological anticoagulants proteins C and S and antithrombin III and 2 had anti-phospholipid antibody (lupus anticoagulant) syndromes. A further patient had reduced levels of the physiological fibrinolytic agent tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). In 5 patients other risk factors for small vessel occlusive disease were also present, and 4 had recurrent episodes of ION in the same eye. The visual prognosis in these patients may be improved by anticoagulation with warfarin.
