We describe a case of MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma associated to post-hepatitis C liver cirrhosis, type II cryoglobulinaemia, gastrointestinal bleedings and thromboses. HCV infection justified the association between the first three pathologies, while gastrointestinal bleedings and thromboses were respectively attributed to portal hypertension secondary to liver cirrhosis and to some thrombophilic conditions. Among the latter there was also an antithrombin III deficiency. The singularity of the case and some difficulties met in its treatment, justify the report.
