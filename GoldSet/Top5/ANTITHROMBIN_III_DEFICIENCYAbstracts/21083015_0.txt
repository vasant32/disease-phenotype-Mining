ATryn(Â®) is a transgenically produced recombinant antithrombin (AT) concentrate licensed in Europe and the USA for the thromboprophylaxis of hereditary AT-deficient patients undergoing surgical procedures who are at a high risk of venous thromboembolism. It is also licensed, in the USA only, for prevention the of venous thromboembolism in association with delivery and the immediate post-partum period. ATryn is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion, with weight-adjusted loading and maintenance dosing regimens. Recombinant AT has an identical amino acid structure with minor glycosylation differences to endogenous AT. ATryn has a shorter half-life but an equivalent efficacy to that of plasma-derived AT concentrates in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in this rare distinct group with a high thrombotic risk. In addition, this recombinant product should be free from the risk of human viral or prion transmission.
