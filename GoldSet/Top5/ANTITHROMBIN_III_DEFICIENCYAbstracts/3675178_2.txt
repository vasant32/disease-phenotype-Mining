Patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) exhibit antithrombin III deficiency and several other coagulation abnormalities. In view of increasing recognition of protein C (PC) as an important, naturally occurring anticoagulant and fibrinolytic factor, we studied plasma PC in this population. PC antigen concentration and its anticoagulant activity were measured in nine SCI men with ESRD maintained on hemodialysis and in a control group of ten normal able-bodied men. The results showed a significant increase in PC anticoagulant activity in the SCI group. Consequently, the ratio of the PC activity to its concentration, which is a measure of the functional integrity of PC molecule, was markedly depressed. These findings are indicative of the presence of inactive or abnormal PC in SCI-ESRD patients and may suggest its in vivo activation. The combination of impaired PC activity shown in this study, with previously demonstrated antithrombin III deficiency and other coagulation abnormalities, is suggestive of a hypercoagulable state.
