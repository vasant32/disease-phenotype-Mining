In three different disease entities associated with acquired antithrombin III (AT III) deficiency some of the pathogenetic mechanisms were studied. In liver cirrhosis (23 patients) the AT III level was closely correlated to the activity of hepatocellular synthesized clotting factors, indicating decreased AT III synthesis. In glomerular proteinuria (20 patients not on steroid therapy) the plasma level of AT III correlated inversely to the renal AT III clearance. In contrast to liver cirrhosis and proteinuria, in septicaemia (33 patients) the ratio between AT III antigen (radial immunodiffusion) and functional AT III (heparin cofactor assay using a chromogenic substrate) demonstrated an excess of AT III antigen probably due to inactive AT III-enzyme complexes. Therefore consumption of AT III appears to be an important cause of AT III deficiency in septicaemia. There was an inverse correlation between this ratio and the plasma AT III activity. It is well documented that congenital AT III deficiency predisposes to deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and sometimes to disseminated intravascular coagulation. A similar clinical relevance may be assumed for an acquired AT III deficiency, though so far a relationship between AT III deficiency and DVT has been only established in the nephrotic syndrome.
