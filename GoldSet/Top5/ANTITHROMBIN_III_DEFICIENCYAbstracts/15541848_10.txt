 OBJECTIVE: To determine to what extent adverse pregnancy outcomes are associated with thrombophilia. STUDY DESIGN: We studied 31 women who had HELLP syndrome, placental abruption, fetal growth restriction or unexplained stillbirth (study group), matched with 12 controls. All women were tested for: Factor V, Prothrombin, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) mutations; for Protein C, S and Antithrombin III deficiency; for lupus anticoagulant. Correlation with 24h BP monitoring and uterine Doppler velocimetry indexes at 22-24 weeks' gestation was performed. RESULTS: Women with multiple thrombophilic factors had a significant lower birth weight (1568.33+/-146.8 g versus 2546.45+/-438 g), higher 24 h mean diastolic blood pressure at second trimester (76.3+/-12.5 mmHg versus 65.2+/-7.8 mmHg) and higher RI of uterine arteries (0.69+/-0.05 versus 0.50+/-0.15) than women with single thrombophilic factor. CONCLUSION: Multiple thrombophilic factors carry a major additional risk for adverse maternal and fetal outcomes and correlate well with placental maladaptation as indicated by uterine Doppler velocimetry and 24h BP monitoring.
