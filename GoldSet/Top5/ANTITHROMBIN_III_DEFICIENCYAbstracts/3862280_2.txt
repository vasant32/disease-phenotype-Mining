Pst I endonuclease fragment length polymorphism of the antithrombin III probe was studied in a French population. Among 25 subjects tested, 15 were found heterozygous at the Pst I site, so that this polymorphism might serve as a useful markers of antithrombin III gene in families with antithrombin III deficiency.
