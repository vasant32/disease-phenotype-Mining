BACKGROUND: Antithrombin III deficiency is common as well as severe in both consumptive coagulopathy and conditions such as pregnancy induced hypertension. We determined antithrombin III levels in women suffering from pregnancy induced hypertension to determine its usefulness in assessing severity of the disease and outcome. METHODS: Forty-five pregnant women with mild and severe forms of pregnancy induced hypertension and 18 women with normal pregnancies matched for gestational age formed the study population. Fasting blood samples were collected and the plasma separated. Antithrombin III levels were estimated by the kinetic Berichrom antithrombin III method. RESULTS: The mean (SD) antithrombin III levels [0.76 (0.233) IU/ml] were significantly lower in pregnancy induced hypertension compared to the control group [0.97 (0.234) IU/ml]. Low antithrombin III and high diastolic blood pressure (> 110 mmHg) were related to poor pregnancy outcome in primigravidae. CONCLUSION: Mean antithrombin III levels were lower in pregnancy induced hypertension compared to a control group of women especially those who were primigravidae and had a diastolic blood pressure > 110 mmHg. Since low antithrombin III levels and a high diastolic blood pressure result in adverse pregnancy outcome monitoring of antithrombin III levels in pregnancy induced hypertension may help in assessing foetal jeopardy.
