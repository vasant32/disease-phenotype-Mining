We studied the prevalence of antithrombin III (AT III), protein C (PC) and protein S (PS) deficiencies and factor V Leiden mutation in thrombophilia in Taiwan. Eighty-five consecutive and unrelated patients with otherwise unexplained venous thrombophilia were studied. Both antigen and activity of inhibitors were determined using commercial kits (Stago), activated PC sensitivity ratio (APC SR) by Coatest (Chromogenix), and factor V mutation by polymerase chain reaction with sequence specific primer. Of 85 patients, 41 were male, 44 female, and mean age 49.4 years (17-82 years). None had factor V mutation, or APC SR of less than 2; 50 (58.8%) showed a deficiency of inhibitor proteins; 34 (68.0%) were hereditary, 16 (32.0%) non-hereditary; 3 had an AT III deficiency, 16 a PC deficiency, 28 a PS deficiency, and 3 a combined deficiency. Thirty-five were non-deficient without a known cause. The average age at the first thrombotic episode was 48.5 years (13-81 years). Thrombosis occurred spontaneously in 39 (78.0%) of 50 deficient patients. In conclusion, a relatively higher prevalence of AT III, PC and PS deficiency (59%), but no factor V Leiden mutation, was found in venous thrombophilic Chinese patients in Taiwan compared to that in western countries. Screening for inhibitor protein deficiency in Chinese thrombophilic patients is highly recommended.
