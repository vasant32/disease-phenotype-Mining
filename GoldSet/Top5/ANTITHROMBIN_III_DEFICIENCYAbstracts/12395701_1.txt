"Traveller's thrombosis" is defined as a deep venous thrombosis of the leg that develops no later than two weeks following a journey lasting at least five hours. According to the WHO, traveller's thrombosis affects in particular persons with additional risk factors. These include obesity, age, such prior diseases as malignant tumours, previous surgery, use of oral contraceptives, and such inborn risk factors as antithrombin III deficiency and homozygous factor V Leiden mutation. In such patients, the (air) journey is merely the triggering event. Prophylactic measures should include counseling of high-risk patients. Depending on the risk profile, recommended general measures are compression and low-molecular-weight heparin. The much discussed use of acetylsalicylic acid, in contrast, is no certain prophylaxis.
