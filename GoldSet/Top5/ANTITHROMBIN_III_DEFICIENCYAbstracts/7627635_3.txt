Patients with liver failure can present both thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications because of the deficiency in coagulation factors and inhibitors (protein C and S, antithrombin III) and impairment of fibrinolytic balance. Here we report the case of a 63-year-old man with liver cirrhosis, recurrent thrombosis, and features of low-grade consumption coagulopathy, showing severe antithrombin III deficiency (about 30% of normal values). Treatment with antithrombin III (2000 U/day) and low doses of heparin (5000 U b.i.d.) was successful in modulating the coagulation system toward an antithrombotic effect. After discharge from hospital the ambulatory treatment with antithrombin III concentrates (2000 U twice a week) allowed the attainment of antithrombin III activity of about 60% and prevented the patient from recurrence of venous thrombosis.
