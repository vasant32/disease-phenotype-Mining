Complications of pregnancy, such as preeclampsia, placental abruption, fetal growth retardation, still-birth and fetal death are associated with an increased frequency of pro-thrombotic abnormalities. We describe a case of severe preeclampsia and multiple placental infarctions in a 28-year-old woman at 31 weeks' gestation. Despite a negative personal history for venous thromboembolism, coagulation screening for thrombophilia detected an isolated antithrombin III deficiency. In view of the high prevalence of pro-thrombotic complications, laboratory screening for thrombophilia would be advantageous in women with complicated pregnancies, to ensure adequate management in high-risk situations, as suggested by larger-scale clinical investigations.
