Protein C and protein S are vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors that together act as an anticoagulant, and antithrombin III is a plasma protein that inhibits several activated factors in the coagulation cascade. Although deficiencies of any of these three proteins have been associated with deficiencies of these factors. We report one patient with a protein S deficiency, another with a protein C deficiency, and a third with an antithrombin III deficiency, each of whom who had extensive arterial thrombosis. We suggest that deficiencies of these proteins may constitute risk factors for arterial thrombosis.
