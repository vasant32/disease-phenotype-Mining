Antithrombin III concentration was studied in 86 patients with recurrent or extensive venous thrombosis. Two of them were found to have an hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. 25 patients receiving heparin therapy had low antithrombin III concentration. After stopping heparin treatment antithrombin rose to a normal level. Pathological antithrombin III modifications are recalled (synthesis decrease in liver diseases, intra vascular consumption during active venous thrombosis). Antithrombin III decreased activity induced by heparin treatment is pointed out.
