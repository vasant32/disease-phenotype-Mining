OBJECTIVE: To present a case of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in which antithrombin III activity in plasma was decreased and in ascites was increased. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Hospital-based clinic for reproductive medicine. PATIENT(S): A 27-year-old woman who was transferred to our hospital because of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. INTERVENTION(S): Induced abortion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Antithrombin III activity in plasma and ascites. RESULT(S): Antithrombin III activity in ascites was slightly lower than that in plasma. CONCLUSION(S): The loss of antithrombin III into ascites probably caused its deficiency in this case.
