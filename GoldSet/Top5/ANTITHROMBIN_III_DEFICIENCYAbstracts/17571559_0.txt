Among the rarely caecal pseudotumours are those caused by a coagulation disorder. The clinical course of caecal pseudotumours is highly variable. Most patients are diagnosed with acute appendicitis, but the real diagnosis is confirmed after laboratory investigation and histopathologic exam. Our patient presented the symptoms of an inferior digestive bleeding. The persistence of the clinical symptoms and the haematological degradation determined the surgical intervention. Intraoperative were found two caecal tumours. The hystological exam, biochemical and haematological analysis worked up the final diagnosis: a caecal pseudotumour in the context of Antithrombin III deficiency.
