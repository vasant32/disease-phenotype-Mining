 AIM: Prolonged temporary implantation of retrievable vena cava filter is little discussed in literature. The aim of our article is to present our experience with a new type of retrievable "Recovery IVC Filter" with prolonged period of placement in the inferior vena cava (IVC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: "Recovery IVC Filter" was implanted in another department for a 27 year old patient with congenital deficiency of anti thrombin III with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) complicated by pulmonary embolism (PE). After 383 days from implantation of vena cava filter, the patient was indicated for removal of the filter from the right jugular vein access. RESULTS: Filter was removed with the help of a special extraction system without significant technical complications in our department. On control phlebography after extraction of cava filter, there were no signs of injury to the wall of inferior vena cava, extravasation or stenosis. CONCLUSION: Removal of "Recovery IVC Filter" after long term temporary implantation is possible and safe.
