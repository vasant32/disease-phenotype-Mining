Severe pulmonary embolism with thrombosis of the inferior vena cava was observed in a 16 year old girl with no risk factors and treated successfully by fibrinolytic therapy. Secondarily, despite heparino-therapy, upper limb venous thrombosis occurred. Investigation of the clotting factors in the patient and her family revealed a hereditary deficit of antithrombin III. The features of the haemotological diagnosis of this rare condition and the therapeutic implications are discussed.
