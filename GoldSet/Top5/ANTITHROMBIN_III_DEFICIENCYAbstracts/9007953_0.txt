There is a high degree of genetic heterogeneity underlying antithrombin deficiency indicating that a number of genetic mechanisms are responsible for the disorder. We report the identification of a five nucleotide (CAGAA) deletion in exon 2 of the antithrombin gene that results in a shift in the frame of translation of the mRNA and introduces a premature STOP signal in codon 70. The deleted nucleotides represent one repeat of a duplicated sequence within codons 36-39. The deletion may have arisen by slippage and mispairing of the repeated sequences at the replication fork during DNA synthesis.
