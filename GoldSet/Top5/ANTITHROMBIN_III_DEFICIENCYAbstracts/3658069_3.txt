The immunological functions of antithrombin III and protein C were studied in 8 patients before, during and after hemodialysis. After dialysis a significant decrease in protein C and antithrombin III levels was seen. The changes observed in both proteins after hemodialysis should be considered as a component in the genesis of the hypercoagulation state in these patients.
