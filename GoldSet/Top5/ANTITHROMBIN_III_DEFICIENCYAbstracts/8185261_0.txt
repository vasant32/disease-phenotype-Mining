This paper describes the use of a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in the treatment of a thrombotic episode in a patient with anti-thrombin III deficiency. Subcutaneous Fraxiparine, a low molecular weight heparin, was successfully used in the initial treatment of a second thrombotic episode in this patient with good results--no clot extension and an almost complete resolution of pulmonary emboli. This case demonstrates the advantages of using LMWH over conventional unfractionated heparin (UFH) which include ease of administration and the rapid achievement of optimal anticoagulation in conjunction with a diminished need for laboratory monitoring.
