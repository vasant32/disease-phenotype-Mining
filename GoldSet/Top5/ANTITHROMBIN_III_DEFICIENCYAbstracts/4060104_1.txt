Seven members of a family affected by hereditary antithrombin III deficiency were identified. The disorder was associated with recurrent spontaneous episodes of phlebitis, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism in middle age. Danazol, a 17-alkyl derivative of ethinyl testosterone, which has been used to treat other antiprotease deficiency states, was assessed in the management of two men with antithrombin deficiency. In a dose of 600 mg a day danazol appeared to correct the antithrombin deficiency. This drug may provide a useful adjunct to anticoagulant treatment, particularly before surgery.
