Selected parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis were determined in 25 postmenopausal women, treated chronically for breast cancer with the use of tamoxifen. The significant influence of tamoxifen therapy on the serous fibrinolysis parameters was found. The time of euglobulin lysis was shorter, the concentration of alpha 2-antiplasmin decreased, and plasminogen concentration increased. The content of antithrombin III, fibrinogen, and caolin-cephalin time did not change significantly during therapy, except the prothrombin rate which increased. Tamoxifen is an important medicine with beneficial influence on the fibrinolytic system, without affecting the serous coagulation system.
