The aim of this study was to test the role of the decreased levels of protein C (PC), protein S and antithrombin III on the pathogenesis of retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Of 54 patients with RVO, seven had the decreased levels of PC. We found statistically significant differences for the rate of cases with PC deficiency between the patients with RVO and controls (P < 0.05).
