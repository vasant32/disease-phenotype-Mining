Antithrombin III deficient patients with manifest thromboembolic diseases need long term coumarin treatment. There are contradictory data on the change of AT III during this therapy. The authors observed 5 patients with severe AT III decrease type I, 3 with functional abnormality and 2 with a pathological heparin binding. AT III function was determined by the Gerendás-Rák method and with chromogenic substrate. AT III antigen was measured with Behring M-Partigen and Laurell rocket electrophoresis. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis was carried out in all patients. In patients with type I AT III decrease, AT III hasn't changed even in a long period of more than 10 years. In the other types AT III became normal. The pathological heparin binding wasn't changed.
