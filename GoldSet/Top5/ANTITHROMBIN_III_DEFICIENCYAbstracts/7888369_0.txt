We report the occurrence of livedo reticularis in a patient with symptomatic hereditary type 1 protein C deficiency. Antithrombin III deficiency and the antiphospholipid syndrome may also be associated with livedo reticularis, and we suggest that a thrombophilia screen may be a useful investigation in a patient with otherwise unexplained livedo, particularly if there is a personal or family history of thromboembolism.
