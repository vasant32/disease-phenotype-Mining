<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the distribution of IRF6 coding and splice-site mutations from 549 families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome with that of variants from the 1000 Genomes and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Projects.Methods:We compiled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> published pathogenic IRF6 mutations and performed direct sequencing of IRF6 in families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome.Results:Although mutations causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome were nonrandomly distributed with significantly increased frequencies in the DNA-binding domain (P = 0.0001), variants found in controls were rare and evenly distributed in IRF6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 194 different missense or nonsense variants described as potentially pathogenic, we identified only two in more than 6,000 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PolyPhen and SIFT (sorting intolerant from tolerant) reported 5.9% of missense mutations in patients as benign, suggesting that use of current in silico prediction models to determine function can have significant false negatives.Conclusion:Mutation of IRF6 occurs infrequently in controls, suggesting that for IRF6 there is a high probability that disruption of the coding sequence, particularly the DNA-binding domain, will result in syndromic features </plain></SENT>
