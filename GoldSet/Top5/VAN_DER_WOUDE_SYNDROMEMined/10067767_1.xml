<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Congenital fistulae of the lower lips of 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> were analyzed by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The walls of most of the fistulae consisted of stratified nonkeratinized squamous epithelium and a lamina propria of dense connective tissue with areas of lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bundles of striated muscle fibers, blood vessels, nerves, adipose tissue, and mixed acinar glands were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These glands surrounded the entire wall of the lesion, and their excretory ducts opened into the lumen of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, explaining the clinical observation of elimination of mucous secretion through the opening of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two microform cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> were analyzed that presented only a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in the epithelium at the site corresponding to the opening of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
