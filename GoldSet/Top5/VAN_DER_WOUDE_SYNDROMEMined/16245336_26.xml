<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To provide insights into the role of IRF6 during embryogenesis, we have analysed the expression of this molecule during mouse and chick facial development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Irf6 was expressed in the ectoderm covering the facial processes during their fusion to form the upper lip and primary palate in both mouse and chick </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, while Irf6 was expressed in the medial edge epithelia of the developing secondary palate of the mouse, which fuses as in man, Irf6 was not expressed in the medial edge epithelia of the naturally cleft chick secondary palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Irf6 was found to be down-regulated in the medial edge epithelia of transforming growth factor beta3-null mice, which also exhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these results support a role for IRF6 during the fusion events that occur during development of the lip and palate </plain></SENT>
