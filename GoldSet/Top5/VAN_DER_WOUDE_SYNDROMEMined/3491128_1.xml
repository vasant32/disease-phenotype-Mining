<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight percent of gene carriers are not diagnosed because they are nonpenetrant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But among penetrant gene carriers as many as 80% may not have been recognized in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A direct estimate of incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> is 3.6/100,000 births; indirect estimates are more than double that </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of inheriting a cleft from an affected parent is 22.43%; the risk of inheriting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100267'>lip pits</z:hpo> only, or being nonpenetrant is 27.57% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(This corrects a similar statement in the abstract of Burdick et al [J Craniofacial Genet Dev Biol 5:181-208, 1985], which was incorrectly calculated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The idea of unitary control of the action of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> gene in the three target tissues appears not to be supported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rather, we tend to support the idea that the gene is controlled independently in the three tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indications of a family at risk are listed and discussed </plain></SENT>
