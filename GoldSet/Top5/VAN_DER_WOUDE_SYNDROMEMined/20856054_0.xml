<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Orofacial clefting is a common condition found in 1 per 700 to 1 per 1000 births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although most cases are isolated, a subset is caused by a specific genetic mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specific gene tests have been used for recognizable syndromes such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220704" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">velocardiofacial syndrome</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">van der Woude syndrome</z:e>, where the cleft is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158795" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">other anomalies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, many <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate patients have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158795" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">other anomalies</z:e> but do not fit in to a recognizable syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For these patients, chromosome analysis has been a first-line genetic test; however, in the past few years, a new form of genetic testing has become available for these patients: array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We present a 7-month-old male infant with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, and a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000220'>velopharyngeal insufficiency</z:hpo> in whom aCGH array was used to identify a small deletion on the short (p) arm of chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This defect, which was also found in the mother, was undetected by chromosome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, this case demonstrates that aCGH is a new diagnostic tool that is useful in the evaluation of select cases of orofacial clefting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Array comparative genome hybridization should be considered when the suspicion for a genetic etiology of the clefting remains strong despite a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
