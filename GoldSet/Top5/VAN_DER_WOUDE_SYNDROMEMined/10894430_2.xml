<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both individuals had bilateral complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate, oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0154933" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">synechiae</z:e>, paramedian pits on the lower lip, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001770'>toe syndactyly</z:hpo> and a piece of triangular skin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> on the great toes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The son also presented with soft tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> of the 2nd and 3rd fingers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> was not found, the above clinical features were diagnostic for PPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities were not revealed in either case by cytogenetic analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A test for microdeletion in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> region at 1q32-q41 was performed in the family using 5 polymorphic microsatellite markers from the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The affected son was found to be heterozygous for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 markers, suggesting that microdeletion at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> region was unlikely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> locus, however, was not excluded by haplotype analysis of the family </plain></SENT>
