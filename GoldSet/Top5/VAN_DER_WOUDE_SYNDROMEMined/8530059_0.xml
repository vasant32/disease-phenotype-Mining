<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cells contain chromosome 1q25-qter translocated to human chromosome Xp22 as the only human genetic material in mouse background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight NotI linking clones have been mapped by a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization and R-banding to cytogenetic bands on the long arm of chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative order of 11 NotI clones and their relation to known chromosome 1 markers have also been determined in 1q32 and 1q41, where the genes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Usher syndrome</z:e> type IIa have been previously mapped: cen-chr1.14-chr1.79-chr1.56-chr1.11-chr1.9 5- chr1.58 (chr1.74)-D1S70-chr1.15-chr1.82 (chr1.143)-chr1.62-D1S81-tel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 1q32- and 1q41-specific NotI linking clones were sequenced in the vicinity of the NotI site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were analyzed in terms of nucleotide composition, G+C content, frequency of CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi>, and protein coding potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the 1q32-q41-specific NotI linking clones were derived from CpG islands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequences of three NotI linking clones proved to be identical with known genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six of the remaining eight had a high potential for coding regions and shared short homologous regions with sequences in the GenBank database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The NotI linking clones and the identified CpG islands will provide valuable resources for constructing a long-range restriction map of chromosome 1q25-q44 and for the eventual isolation of disease genes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> (1q32-q41) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Usher syndrome</z:e> type IIa (1q41) </plain></SENT>
