<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of pits on the lower lip of patients is the most characteristic feature of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified three novel and seven previously reported IRF6 mutations in 12 of 16 unrelated families segregating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> from Pakistan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The three newly identified mutations include a frameshift (c.568delG) and two missense mutations c.295G&gt;A (p.G99S) and c.1219T&gt;C (p.S407P) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent functional studies on IRF6 and the three-dimensional structure of IRF5 carboxy (C) terminus, a protein encoded by a paralog of IRF6, shed light on the p.S407P substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the identification of the same mutations responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> in Pakistan, as reported in other global populations worldwide, marks these residues as mutational hotspots and indicates their essential role in structural stability or function of IRF6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> in Pakistan and we estimate that 1 in 100 patients with CL with or without CP (CL/P) are affected in the Pakistani population predominantly from the Punjab area </plain></SENT>
