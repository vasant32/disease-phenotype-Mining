<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the IRF6 mutation profile in PPS, we performed mutation analysis of patients from two unrelated Japanese families with PPS and identified mutations in IRF6: c.251G&gt;T (R84L) and c.1271C&gt;T (S424L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also found R84L, which together with previous reports on R84 mutations, provided another line of evidence that both syndromes could result from the same mutation probably under an influence of a modifier gene(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This supports the idea that the R84 residue in the DNA binding domain of IRF6 is a mutational hot spot for PPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A luciferase assay of the S424L protein in the other family demonstrated that the mutation decreased the IRF6 transcriptional activity significantly to 6% of that of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that the C-terminus region of IRF6 could have an important function in phosphorylation or protein interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report of mutations observed in Japanese PPS patients </plain></SENT>
