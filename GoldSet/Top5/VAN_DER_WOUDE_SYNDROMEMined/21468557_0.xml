<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations in IRF6 have been revealed to be responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> in European, Asian, North American and Brazilian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mutations responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> have not been studied in Central American populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the role of IRF6 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> in a previously unstudied Honduran population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IRF6 mutations were identified in four out of five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> families examined, which strongly suggests that mutations in IRF6 are responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We reported three novel mutations and one previously described mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the first family, a mother and daughter both exhibited a p.N88I mutation in the DNA-binding region of IRF6 that was not present in unaffected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second, we found a unique p.K101QfsX15 mutation in the affected patient, leading to a frameshift and early stop codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the third, we identified a p.Q208X mutation occurring in exon 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the fourth, we found a nonsense mutation in exon 9 (p.R412X), previously described in Brazilian and Northern European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the fifth, we did not identify any unique exonic missense, nonsense or frameshift mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study reports the first cases of IRF6 mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> patients in a Central American population, further confirming that the causal link between IRF6 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> is consistent across multiple populations </plain></SENT>
