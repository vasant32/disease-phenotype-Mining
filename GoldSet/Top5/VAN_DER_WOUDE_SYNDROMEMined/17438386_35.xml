<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6), the gene that causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">van der Woude syndrome</z:e> has been shown to be associated with nonsyndromic <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> with or without palate in several populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to confirm the contribution of IRF6 to <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> with or without palate risk in additional Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A set of 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms was tested for association with <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> with or without palate in 77 European American, 146 Taiwanese, 34 Singaporean, and 40 Korean case-parent trios using both the transmission disequilibrium test and conditional logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Evidence of linkage and association was observed among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four populations; and two specific haplotypes [GC composed of rs2235373-rs2235371 (p.V274I) and AAG of rs599021-rs2235373-rs595918] showed the most significant over- and undertransmission among Taiwanese cases (P=9x10(-6) and P=5x10(-6), respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AGC/CGC diplotype composed of rs599021-rs2235373-rs2013162 showed almost a 7-fold increase in risk among the Taiwanese sample (P&lt;10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results confirmed the contribution of this gene to susceptibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000202'>oral clefts</z:hpo> across different populations; however, the specific single nucleotide polymorphisms showing statistical significance differed among ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The high-risk genotypes and diplotypes identified here may provide a better understanding of the etiological role of this gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000202'>oral clefts</z:hpo> and potential options for genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
