<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been estimated to account for 2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> is one of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorders</z:e> in which clefting of the primary and secondary palate may be seen to segregate as components associated with the same gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of its <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> is readily accessable to linkage analysis as a preliminary step in the identification of the molecular abnormality underlying the clefting effect in the primary and secondary palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A reported linkage between REN and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> has promoted us to use pHRnX3.6 (REN) and several markers surrounding REN for a linkage analysis in a large Swiss family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a second step, linkage analysis was performed to study restriction fragment length polymorphisms for the candidate gene TGFB2 and other loci recently mapped to the candidate region 1q32-1q41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence for linkage (theta = 0.00, lod score = 3.01) between REN and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> could be confirmed in this pedigree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TGFB2 demonstrated recombination with the disease locus and is unlikely to be causative in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of a multipoint linkage analysis showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> was flanked by D1S65 and TGFB2 at a maximum location score of 20.3 </plain></SENT>
