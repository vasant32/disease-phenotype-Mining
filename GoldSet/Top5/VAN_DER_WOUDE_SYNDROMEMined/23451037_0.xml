<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in IRF6 lead to isolated and syndromic forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate, most notably <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>) and Popliteal Ptyerigium Syndrome (PPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice lacking both copies of Irf6 have severe limb, skin, palatal and esophageal abnormalities, due to significantly altered and delayed epithelial development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a recent report showed that MCS9.7, an enhancer near Irf6, is active in the tongue, suggesting that Irf6 may also be expressed in the tongue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we detected Irf6 staining in the mesoderm-derived muscle during development of the tongue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dual labeling experiments demonstrated that Irf6 was expressed only in the Myf5+ cell lineage, which originates from the segmental paraxial mesoderm and gives rise to the muscles of the tongue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fate mapping of the segmental paraxial mesoderm cells revealed a cell-autonomous Irf6 function with reduced and poorly organized Myf5+ cell lineage in the tongue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Molecular analyses showed that the Irf6-/- embryos had aberrant cytoskeletal formation of the segmental paraxial mesoderm in the tongue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fate mapping of the cranial neural crest cells revealed non-cell-autonomous Irf6 function with the loss of the inter-molar eminence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Loss of Irf6 function altered Bmp2, Bmp4, Shh, and Fgf10 signaling suggesting that these genes are involved in Irf6 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, Irf6 plays important cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous roles in muscular differentiation and cytoskeletal formation in the tongue </plain></SENT>
