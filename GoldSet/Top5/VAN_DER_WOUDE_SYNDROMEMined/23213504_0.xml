<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are more than 500 CL/P syndromes described, the causes of which may be single-gene mutations, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chromosomopathies</z:e>, and exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50905">teratogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonsyndromic CL/P, on the other hand, is a complex disorder, whose etiology is still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent genome-wide association studies have contributed to the elucidation of the genetic causes, by raising reproducible susceptibility genetic variants; their etiopathogenic roles, however, are difficult to predict, as in the case of the chromosomal region 8q24, the most corroborated locus predisposing to nonsyndromic CL/P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Knowing the genetic causes of CL/P will directly impact the genetic counseling, by estimating precise recurrence risks, and the patient management, since the patient, followup may be partially influenced by their genetic background </plain></SENT>
