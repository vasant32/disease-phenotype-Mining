<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of 11,000 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and/or palate registered at the <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>Cleft Lip</z:mp>-Palate Research and Rehabilitation Hospital, University of SÃ£o Paulo, Bauru were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 133 (1.2%) presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 133 patients, 88 (66.2%) exhibited full clefts, 22 (16.5%) only <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>, and 23 (17.3%) only <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lower-lip fistulae observed in these 133 patients were bilateral symmetric in 66 (49.7%), bilateral asymmetric in 42 (31.6%), microform in 19 (14.3%), median in 5 (3.8%), and unilateral in 1 (0.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This population sample appears to exhibit the previously published tendency for bilateral, unilateral, or mixed-type congenital fistulae to be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, while so-called microforms or conic elevations are almost exclusively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
