<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the first study that tries to replicate this finding and we provide further evidence that IRF6 contributes to isolated tooth <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> tooth <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> cases and their parents were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA samples were obtained from whole blood or saliva samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed by TaqMan assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linkage disequilibrium analysis and transmission distortion of the marker alleles were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A haplotype involving the most 5'IRF6 markers was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> tooth <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> (p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An association could still be seen when only cases with at least one missing incisor (p=0.01) and cases with at least one missing premolar (p=0.004) were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
