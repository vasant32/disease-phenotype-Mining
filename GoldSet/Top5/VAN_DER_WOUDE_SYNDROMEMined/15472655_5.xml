<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its prevalence is estimated to be 1/33,600 in the Finnish Population, and 1/47,813 in the Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed mutation analysis of the IRF6 gene by direct sequencing in 2 unrelated Japanese families that consist of a total of 3 affected members with <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000196'>lower lip pits</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we found novel base substitutions, 25C&gt;T, in IRF6-exon 3 in a boy, his mother, and his phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> maternal grandmother in one of the families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A known mutation, 250C&gt;T, was identified in exon 4 of a girl and her unaffected father in the other family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same mutations were never observed among 190 healthy Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003828'>variable expressivity</z:hpo> in the families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because 25C&gt;T and 250C&gt;T predict to lead to R9W and R84C substitutions, respectively, at the most conserved DNA binding domain of IRF6, and because arginine at positions 9 and 84 is highly conserved among IRFs, the 2 mutations may lead to abolish the DNA binding activity in the developing craniofacial region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report of IRF6 mutations observed in Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
