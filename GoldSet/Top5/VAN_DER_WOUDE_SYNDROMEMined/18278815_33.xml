<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100267'>Lip pits</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006349'>missing teeth</z:hpo> are the only additional features distinguishing the syndrome from isolated clefts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e>, therefore, provides an excellent model for studying the isolated forms of clefting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From a population-based case-control study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002006'>facial clefts</z:hpo> in Norway (1996-2001), we selected 377 <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> (CL/P), 196 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> only (CPO), and 763 control infant-parent triads for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We genotyped six single nucleotide polymorphisms within the IRF6 locus and estimated the relative risks (RR) conferred on the child by alleles and haplotypes of the child and of the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the whole, there were strong statistical associations with CL/P but not CPO in our data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In single-marker analyses, mothers with a double-dose of the 'a'-allele at rs4844880 had an increased risk of having a child with CL/P (RR=1.85, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-3.25; P=0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An RR of 0.38 (95% confidence interval: 0.16-0.92; P=0.031) was obtained when the child carried a single-dose of the 'a'-allele at rs2235371 (the p.V274I polymorphism) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The P-value for the overall test was &lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In haplotype analyses, several of the fetal and maternal haplotype relative risks were statistically significant individually but were not strong enough to show up on the overall test (P=0.113) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings further support a role for IRF6 variants in clefting of the lip and provide specific risk estimates in a Norwegian population </plain></SENT>
