<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that maxillary growth and lower lip form in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">van der Woude syndrome</z:e> (VDW) is different from patients with non-syndromic <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective, case-control study at a tertiary cleft center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Records of 53 patients with VDW, who presented for treatment during the years 1968 through 1998 were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three of 53 patients had received at least one lateral cephalogram during the course of their treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these 23, in 17 it was possible to find non-syndromic case controls with identical cleft type, sex, and method of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> repair, with year of birth matching within 1 year of the corresponding VDW patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For these 17 pairs of VDW and non-syndromic cleft controls, cephalogram acquisition dates were checked to see how well the corresponding pairs matched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 43 pairs of cephalograms were deemed to be acceptably matched because the ages at acquisition differed by less than 15% of the VDW patient's age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Thirteen measurements were derived from the 11 standard lateral cephalometric landmarks recorded on each cephalogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data were classified into five groups according to age at time of cephalogram, and sets of paired non-syndromic cleft and VDW measurements were tested for differences using a Wilcoxon signed rank sum test in two ways, first including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cleft types and then including only those patients with complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002744'>bilateral cleft lip and palate</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A longitudinal growth analysis considering the movement of the skeletal A and B points was performed on the patients with complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002744'>bilateral cleft lip and palate</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the osseous measurements, anteroposterior maxillary length as described by the anterior nasal spine (ANS)-posterior maxillary point distance was statistically significantly shorter in the VDW patients of age 13 years and older, by 5.3 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Maxillary height, as described by the nasion-ANS distance was shorter in the VDW patients, closely approaching statistical significance in the age range 7 through 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The lip soft tissue measurements showed significantly greater protrusion over several age ranges in the VDW patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The longitudinal growth analysis showed a significantly more inferior vertical position of the B point in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a few statistically significant differences in maxillary growth and lip conformation between VDW and matching controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Small sample sizes for each age group hamper the ability to fully interpret or generalize the pattern of these differences </plain></SENT>
