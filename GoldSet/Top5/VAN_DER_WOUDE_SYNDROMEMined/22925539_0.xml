<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Forty-two percent of CPs (49/117) were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158795" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">other congenital anomalies</z:e>; chromosome abnormality was identified in 12 cases and monogenic syndrome was diagnosed in 14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The most frequent chromosome abnormality was 22q11 microdeletion (5 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Monogenic syndromes were recognized in 12% of the CP cases (14/117): <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016667" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">fragile X syndrome</z:e> (2 cases), Meckel syndrome (2 cases), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Orofaciodigital syndrome</z:e> type I (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OFD1</z:e>) (1 case), Stickler syndrome (1 case), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175778" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Larsen syndrome</z:e> (1 case), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265279" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Kniest syndrome</z:e> (1 case), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270972" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CDL|CDLS|BDLS|CDLS1">Cornelia de Lange syndrome</z:e> (1 case), thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (1 case), other unknown bone <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasia</z:mp> (1 case), Fryns syndrome (1 case), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001989'>fetal akinesia sequence</z:hpo> (1 case), and Silver-Russel syndrome (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two percent of CL cases (106/204) were prenatally diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>An increasing tendency was observed between the 1995-2000 and 2001-2006 periods with a detection rate increasing from 47% to 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>During the whole period, only 1 case of CP was prenatally diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases (263/321) were livebirths; 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirths</z:hpo> were reported (2%); 50 syndromic or associated cases (16%) led to medical abortion (no termination of pregnancy was performed for isolated cleft) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Orofacial clefts are a frequent malformation with a total prevalence of 2.1 per 1000 total births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Sonbographic prenatal diagnosis of orofacial clefts remains difficult with a mean detection rate about 50% for CL±P and is extremely rare for CP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Associated malformations and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0567439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic syndromes</z:e> are frequent and require a systematic survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This study also highlights the different pathogenic background of CL±P compared to CP, regarding the sex-ratio and the proportion and type of associated malformations </plain></SENT>
