<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>Cleft lip</z:mp> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> (CL/P) is one of the most common birth defects in the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prevalence varies between populations, with an average of 1/700 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CL/P has a major clinical impact, requiring surgical, dental, orthodontic, speech, hearing and psychological management throughout childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aetiology of CL/P is mostly unknown, and it is thought that both genetic and environmental factors play a role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several causative genes for inherited syndromic forms of CL/P have been identified, and some recent studies have shown that these genes also contribute to the occurrence of isolated forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>) is one of the best models for non-syndromic CLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disorder characterised by the presence of pits on the lower lip in addition to CL/P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pits are the only feature distinguishing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> from isolated clefts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in numerous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> patients, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100267'>lip pits</z:hpo> are very small and not readily diagnosed, thus mimicking isolated CL/P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the IRF6 gene were shown to be the major genetic cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>.' RESULTS: We performed direct sequence analysis of IRF6 on samples from a large European cohort and identified mutations in 27 (80%) families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This shows that IRF6 is the major causative gene of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> in Europe also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is the gene to study when a seemingly isolated CL/P patient has minor signs, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100267'>lip pits</z:hpo>, since the identification of a mutation in IRF6 is associated with an increase in the risk of having a child with CL/P from 4-6%, the risk of transmission of an isolated cleft, to 50%, the risk of transmission of a dominant Mendelian disorder like <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we studied the association of isolated CL/P with the IRF6 locus using two variants in a set of 195 patients from Belgium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As in an American study, a clear association was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This suggests that IRF6 also contributes to the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, isolated CL/P, even if no mutation in the gene can be identified in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In conclusion, genes that are mutated in familial syndromic forms of CL/P may be predisposing genetic factors to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> isolated CL/P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Due to technological advances and the availability of the human genome sequence, we have now the opportunity to try and unravel the genetic factors behind the various forms of CL/P </plain></SENT>
