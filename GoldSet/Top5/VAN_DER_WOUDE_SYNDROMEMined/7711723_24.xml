<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can, however, result from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037176" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">single gene defect</z:e> either as part of a syndrome (e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">van der Woude syndrome</z:e>, Treacher-Collins <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220704" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">syndrome, velo-cardio-facial</z:e> syndrome) or as an isolated phenotypic effect (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>; non-syndromic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> orofacial clefting) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies have suggested that chromosome 6p is a candidate region for a locus involved in orofacial clefting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have used YAC clones from contigs in 6p25-p23 to investigate three unrelated cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate coincident with chromosome 6p abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case 1 has <z:hpo ids='HP_0002744'>bilateral cleft lip and palate</z:hpo> and a balanced translocation reported as 46,XY,t(6,7)(p23;q36.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case 2 has multiple abnormalities including <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate and was reported as 46,XX,del(6)(p23;pter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Case 3 has <z:hpo ids='HP_0002744'>bilateral cleft lip and palate</z:hpo> and carries a balanced translocation reported as 46,XX,t(6;9)(p23;q22.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have identified two YAC clones, both of which cross the breakpoint in cases 1 and 3 and are deleted in case 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These clones map to 6p24.3 and therefore suggest the presence of a locus for orofacial clefting in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The HGP22 and AP2 genes, potentially involved in face formation, have been found to flank this region, while F13A maps further telomeric in 6p24.3/25 </plain></SENT>
