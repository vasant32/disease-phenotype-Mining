<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the IRF6 gene have recently been found to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> and more than 70 mutations have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, genotype distribution and prevalence of IRF6 mutations underlying Chinese are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we report on four Chinese families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Considerably variable clinical phenotypes were observed between and within each family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By direct sequencing, three novel mutations (Y111H, S407fsX436, F165fsX166) as well as a recurrent mutation (R400W) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the IRF6 mutations reported in Caucasians, the majority of these mutations occurred at a run of 1- or 2-base repetitive sequence unit, and localized neither in the conserved DNA-binding domain nor in the Smad-interferon regulatory factor-binding domain (SMIR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our results indicate the existence of other putative IRF6 regions that are predisposed to mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeated <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> in the IRF6 coding regions may increase the instability and chance of DNA replication errors, and are prone to be potential mutation hot-spots </plain></SENT>
