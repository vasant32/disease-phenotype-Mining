<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IRF6 belongs to a family of transcription factors that share a highly conserved N-terminal, DNA-binding domain and a less well-conserved protein-binding domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, mutation analyses have suggested a broad genotype-phenotype correlation in which missense and nonsense mutations occurring throughout IRF6 may cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>; in contrast, PPS-causing mutations are highly associated with the DNA-binding domain, and appear to preferentially affect residues that are predicted to interact directly with the DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, this genotype-phenotype correlation is based on the analysis of structural models rather than on the investigation of the DNA-binding properties of IRF6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the effects of mutations in the protein interaction domain have not been analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the current investigation, we have determined the sequence to which IRF6 binds and used this sequence to analyse the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>- and PPS-associated mutations in the DNA-binding domain of IRF6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have demonstrated that IRF6 functions as a co-operative transcriptional activator and that mutations in the protein interaction domain of IRF6 disrupt this activity </plain></SENT>
