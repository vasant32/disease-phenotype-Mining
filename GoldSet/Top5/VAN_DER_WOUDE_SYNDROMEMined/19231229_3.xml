<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cases of combinations of bony or soft tissue <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> between the mandible and maxilla with cleft of the lip or palate, aglossia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">van der Woude syndrome</z:e> have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: The aim of this paper is to report a case of fibrous maxillomandibular fusion of the jaws, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0154933" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">synechiae</z:e> of buccal mucosa and the gingivae, which was referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial team of the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana soon after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Separation of the fusion was done under nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>/oxygen sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cleft of the hard palate was discovered during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Maxillomandibular syngnathia is considered rare and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0154933" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">synechiae</z:e> with other maxillofacial abnormalities without syngnathia could exist and should not be ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This report adds more information to the literature, by reporting a baby with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0154933" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">synechiae</z:e> and a cleft of the palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prompt, definitive diagnosis and management of other abnormalities in the baby could only be done under deep sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was necessary to avoid deformity and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
