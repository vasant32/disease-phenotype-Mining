<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize Swedish families with non-syndromic <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and/or palate (NSCL/P) for mutations or other sequence variants in the interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) gene, as well as to describe their cleft phenotypes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000668'>hypodontia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen Swedish families with at least two family members with NSCL/P were identified and clinically evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extracted DNA from blood samples was used for IRF6 mutation screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exonic fragments of the IRF6 gene were sequenced and chromatograms were inspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was undertaken with marker- and haplotype association tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No disease-associated IRF6 mutation could be determined in the families analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One new and seven known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The A allele of SNP rs861019 in exon 2 and the G allele of SNP rs7552506 in intron 3 showed association with <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate (CLP; odds ratios of 3.1 and 5.45, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000668'>Hypodontia</z:hpo> was observed more commonly in individuals affected with CL/P as compared with family members without a cleft (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000668'>hypodontia</z:hpo> most often affected the cleft area, possibly representing a secondary effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The distribution of cleft phenotypes in 15 of the 17 families with NSCL/P differed from the mixed cleft types seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>), in that CLP did not occur together with an isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> within the same family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that mutations of the IRF6 gene are not a common cause for cleft predisposition in Swedish NSCL/P families </plain></SENT>
