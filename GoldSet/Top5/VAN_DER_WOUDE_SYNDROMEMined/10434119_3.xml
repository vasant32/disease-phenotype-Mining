<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vWS gene has been assigned to a locus in 1q32-q41 by linkage analysis and physical mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated 5 novel vWS families through probands attended for <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and/or palate repair at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery of HÃ´pital Trousseau, Paris, in order to tentatively refine the genetic map of the vWS region in 1q32-q41 and possibly identify unlinked pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis was carried out to 6 microsatellite markers (D1S249, D1S425, D1S491, D1S205, D1S414, D1S425), yielding a maximum cumulative LOD score of Z = 3.27 at theta = 0.00 for D1S245 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The innermost four markers were found to be tightly linked to one another, with no evidence for recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results support linkage of vWS within a region of tightly linked markers and do not favour locus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the disease trait </plain></SENT>
