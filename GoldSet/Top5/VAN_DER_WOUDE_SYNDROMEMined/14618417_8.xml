<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three Japanese families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>) were screened for mutations in the interferon regulatory factor 6 gene (IRF6) by sequencing its entire coding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two novel missense mutations, R45Q in exon 3 and P396S in exon 9, were identified in families 1 and 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In family 3, no causative base change was found by the sequencing analysis, but a deletion involving exons 4-9 was suggested by multiplex PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To confirm the deletion and to determine its 5'- and 3'-boundaries, we amplified a DNA fragment containing a heterozygous polymorphic site in exon 2 by using a 5'-upstream forward PCR primer and eight different reverse primers located 3'-downstream of exon 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amplified product was subjected to nested PCR to generate a DNA fragment containing the polymorphic site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When a reverse primer located within the deletion was used for the first PCR amplification, only the nondeletion allele was detected after the second PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Repeated analyses with eight different reverse primers allowed us to map the boundaries of the deletion, and subsequently a heterozygous 17,162-bp deletion involving exons 4-9 was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since IRF6 mutations in a significant portion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> patients remain undetected by conventional sequencing analysis, it may be important to search for a large deletion in those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our simple methods to identify deletions and to determine the boundaries of a deletion would facilitate the identification of such patients </plain></SENT>
