<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 15% of the patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100267'>lip pits</z:hpo> are absent and the phenotype mimics isolated clefts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesized that some of the families classified as having non-syndromic inherited <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate could have an IRF6 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We screened in total 170 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> (CL/P): 75 were syndromic and 95 were a priori part of multiplex non-syndromic families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mutation was identified in 62.7 and 3.3% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one of the 95 a priori non-syndromic families with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> (family B), new insights into the family history revealed the presence, at birth, of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000196'>lower lip pits</z:hpo> in two members and the diagnosis was revised as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A novel lower lip sign was observed in one individual in this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a similar lower lip sign was also observed in one individual from a 2nd family (family A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This consists of 2 nodules below the lower lip on the external side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a 3rd multiplex family (family C), a de novo mutation was identified in an a priori non-syndromic CL/P patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Re-examination after mutation screening revealed the presence of a tiny pit-looking lesion on the inner side of the lower lip leading to a revised diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the basis of this data, we conclude that IRF6 should be screened when any doubt rises about the normality of the lower lip and also if a non-syndromic <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> patient (with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>) has a family history suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
