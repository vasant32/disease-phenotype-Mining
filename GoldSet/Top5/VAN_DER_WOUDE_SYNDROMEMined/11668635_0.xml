<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our efforts to clone the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> gene, 900 kb of genomic sequence from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> candidate region at chromosome 1q32-q41 was analyzed for new DNA sequence variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed that in clone CTA-321i20 a 7922 bp sequence is absent relative to the sequence present in PAC clone RP4-782d21 at positions 1669-9590, suggesting the presence of a deletion/insertion (del/ins) polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embedded in this 7922 bp region was a TTCC short tandem repeat (STR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotype analysis showed that both the internal STR and the (del/ins) mutation were true polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is a novel example of intraallelic variation, a polymorphism within a polymorphism, and we suggest that it be termed a "Matroshka" polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further genetic and DNA sequence analysis indicated that the ancestral state of the 1669-9590 del/ins polymorphism was the insertion allele and that the original deletion mutation probably occurred only once </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A second class of novel DNA sequence variation was discovered on chromosome 5 that shared a 328 bp identical sequence with this region on chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected by SSCP using a pair of primers derived from the chromosome 1 sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, these primers also amplified the identical locus on chromosome 5, and the SNP was only located on chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since the probe unexpectedly detected alleles from another locus, we suggest that this type of sequence variant be termed an "ectopic" polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These two novel classes of DNA sequence polymorphisms have the potential to confound genetic and DNA sequence analysis and may also contribute to variation in disease phenotypes </plain></SENT>
