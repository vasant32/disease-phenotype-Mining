<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The standard of practice for children born with <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>/palate is surgical repair, which requires proper wound healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> are more likely to have wound complications after cleft repair than children with nonsyndromic <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>/palate (NSCLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we hypothesized that children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> have more surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A retrospective, case-controlled study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> and 68 matched controls with NSCLP were scored for the presence of wound complications after cleft repair, for the severity of complications, and for number of surgeries from age 0 to 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 17 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>, 8 had wound complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 68 controls, 13 had wound complications (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 8 wound complications in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> group, 6 were major, whereas of 13 complications in the control group, 9 were major (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most wound complications were fistulae and occurred in isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100336'>bilateral cleft lip</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean number of surgeries in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> group was 3.0 compared with 2.8 in the control group (P = 0.67) </plain></SENT>
