<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To find a gene mutation in a Japanese family using fingernail DNA samples, we performed this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a gene mutation in IRF6 might be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>, and that fingernail DNA samples may be valuable for detecting such mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linkage and haplotype analyses of the family mapped the disease locus to the 1q32-q41 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis with an improved extraction method for fingernail DNA detected a novel missense mutation (1046A&gt;T, E349V) in exon 7 of IRF6 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the affected members of the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the E349V change may disturb the hydrophobic core and affect regulatory activity of IRF6, it is most likely that the mutation is causative for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> in this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fingernail DNA is thus useful for linkage and mutation analyses, since the fingernail can be easily obtained non-invasively, sent through the mail, and stored for a long period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We emphasize here the usefulness of fingernail DNA for the genetic analysis of a disease </plain></SENT>
