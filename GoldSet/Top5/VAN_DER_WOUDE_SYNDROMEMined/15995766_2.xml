<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate IRF6 gene mutation in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">van Der Woude syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>) family in Henan province </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PCR and DNA sequencing was employed to detect the mutation of IRF6.Secondary construction transformation analysis was performed using PIX-Protein Identification software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A CGC&gt;TGC(r.279c--&gt;t) transversion of IRF6 was identified in condon 6, showing complete segregation with the disease phenotypes and was resulting in changes of the secondary constructure of IRF6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> is caused by mutations in IRF6 gene, and IRF6 is closely related to the development of lip, palate and tooth </plain></SENT>
