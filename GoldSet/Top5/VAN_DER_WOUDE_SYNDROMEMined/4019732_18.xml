<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have brought together information on 864 affected individuals in 164 families (including three new pedigrees) reported in the 137 year period since 1845 when Demarquay first described a family with what was later called <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">van der Woude syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000202'>oral cleft</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> (CP) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> with or without CP (CLP), segregate in these families together with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000196'>lower lip pits</z:hpo> or fistulae in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> mode with high penetrance estimated to be K = .89 and .99 by different methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cleft types (CLP and CP) occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> in the same proportions as in the general non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> population, ie, about twice as many cleft-bearing individuals have CLP as have CP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, we do not find the usually observed excess of females with CP and excess of males with CLP; in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> the sex ratios are more nearly equal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100267'>Lip pits</z:hpo> also are equally distributed between the sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Affected males and females are equally likely to transmit <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there is an excess of less severely affected individuals among transmitters and a deficiency of more severely affected, brought about by a proband bias and differential fecundity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> is significantly modified by the genetic background: More extreme phenotypes in parents tend to produce more extreme expression in their children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> gene carrier the relative risk of transmitting a cleft is 26.45%; that of transmitting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000196'>lower lip pits</z:hpo> is 23.55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three pedigrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100267'>lip pits</z:hpo> in the literature show no clefts among a significant number of affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Control of gene expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> in the three target tissues appears to be independent and separately designated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mutation rate of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> gene is calculated to be 1.8 X 10(-5) </plain></SENT>
