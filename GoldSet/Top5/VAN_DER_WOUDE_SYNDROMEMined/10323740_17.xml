<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reported previously a family whose underlying mutation is a 500-800 kb deletion localized to chromosome bands 1q32-q41 [Sander et al., 1994: Hum Mol Genet 3:576-578] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Along with <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>/palate and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100267'>lip pits</z:hpo>, affected relatives exhibit developmental delays, suggesting that the function of a gene nearby may also be disrupted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further localize the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> gene we searched for other deletions that cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An allele loss assay was performed using a novel highly polymorphic marker, D1S3753 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From a panel of 37 unrelated individuals, we detected an allele loss in one family, indicating the presence of a deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this family, the phenotype in three generations of affected individuals was confined to the cardinal signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, mapping of the new deletion showed that it extended 0.2-1 Mb beyond the proximal breakpoint for the deletion described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No deletions were detected in seven cases of popliteal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001059'>pterygia</z:hpo> syndrome, 76 cases of mixed syndromic forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate, and 178 cases of nonsyndromic <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that genetic searches for microdeletions should be routine in screening patients for causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> and may facilitate the positional cloning efforts of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> gene and of a nearby gene or genes that may be involved in brain development </plain></SENT>
