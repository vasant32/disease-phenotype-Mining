<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Development and subsequent maintenance of this tissue depends critically on the intricate balance between proliferation and differentiation of a resident stem cell population; however, the signals controlling the proliferation-differentiation switch in vivo remain elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that mice carrying a homozygous missense mutation in interferon regulatory factor 6 (Irf6), the homolog of the gene mutated in the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disorders</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome, have a hyperproliferative epidermis that fails to undergo terminal differentiation, resulting in soft tissue fusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrate that mice that are compound heterozygotes for mutations in Irf6 and the gene encoding the cell cycle regulator protein stratifin (Sfn; also known as 14-3-3sigma) show similar defects of keratinizing epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that Irf6 is a key determinant of the keratinocyte proliferation-differentiation switch and that Irf6 and Sfn interact genetically in this process </plain></SENT>
