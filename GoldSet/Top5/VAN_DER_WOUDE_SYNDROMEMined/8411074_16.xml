<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Candidate genes and marker loci for <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>/palate (CL/P) were tested using linkage analyses and association studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight British families with apparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> of non-syndromic CL/P participated in the linkage analyses while the association analyses involved 61 unrelated British white people with CL/P and 60 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The report of an association between RARA (17q21) and unrelated Australian persons with CL/P (p = 0.016) was not confirmed in British CL/P persons (chi 2 = 0.954, p &gt; 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was also no evidence of linkage between RARA and the eight CL/P families (Z = -3.211, theta = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage was excluded between familial CL/P and F13A1 (map position 6p24-25) with an observed maximum lod score of Z = -2.052 at theta = 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No association was found between alleles at VIM (10p13) and the British CL/P subjects (chi 2 = 0.110, p &gt; 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multipoint analysis excluded linkage between familial CL/P and the markers D1S65 and D1S58 which flank the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> locus with a maximum lod score of Z = -4.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the genetic defect underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> is not the same as in non-syndromic CL/P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of linkage between CRTL1 (5q15) and the eight CL/P families (Z = -3.466, theta = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
