<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two human cDNA clones that encode different interleukin-8 (IL8) receptors have recently been isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The interleukin-8 receptor type 1 (IL8R1) binds IL8 only, whereas the interleukin-8 receptor type 2 (IL8R2) (previously designated IL8RA) also binds growth regulated gene (GRO), and neutrophil activating protein-2 (NAP-2) with high affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the process of screening a genomic library with these cDNAs to obtain large clones for use in chromosomal localization studies, we isolated an interleukin-8 receptor pseudogene (IL8RP) that bears greatest similarity to IL8R2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using Southern hybridization analysis of human x rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs with cDNA probes for IL8R1 and IL8R2 and probes from the IL8RP locus, we assigned the three loci to chromosome 2; fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to metaphase chromosome preparations using genomic clones from each locus refined this localization to chromosome 2, band q35, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By virtue of their chromosomal location, IL8R1 and IL8R2 may be considered candidate genes for several human disorders in which the involved locus has been mapped to distal 2q or that are associated with structural abnormalities of this segment, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">van der Woude syndrome</z:e> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic diseases</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042133" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="UL">uterine leiomyomata</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, because this region of chromosome 2q is homologous to proximal mouse chromosome 1 in the segment containing the Lsh-Ity-Bcg locus involved in mediating host <z:mp ids='MP_0002409'>resistance to infection</z:mp> with intracellular pathogens, examination for abnormalities of the murine homologues of the IL8R genes should be considered in mice affected by mutations of this locus </plain></SENT>
