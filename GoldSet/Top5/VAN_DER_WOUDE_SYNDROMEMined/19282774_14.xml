<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Interferon regulatory factor 6 encodes a member of the IRF family of transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in interferon regulatory factor 6 cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome, two related orofacial clefting disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we compared and contrasted the frequency and distribution of exonic mutations in interferon regulatory factor 6 between two large geographically distinct collections of families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude</z:e> and between one collection of families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed direct sequence analysis of interferon regulatory factor 6 exons on samples from three collections, two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude</z:e> and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified mutations in interferon regulatory factor 6 exons in 68% of families in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude</z:e> collections and in 97% of families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In sum, 106 novel disease-causing variants were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution of mutations in the interferon regulatory factor 6 exons in each collection was not random; exons 3, 4, 7, and 9 accounted for 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude</z:e> collections, the mutations were evenly divided between protein truncation and missense, whereas most mutations identified in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome collection were missense </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, the missense mutations associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome were localized significantly to exon 4, at residues that are predicted to bind directly to DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The nonrandom distribution of mutations in the interferon regulatory factor 6 exons suggests a two-tier approach for efficient mutation screens for interferon regulatory factor 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The type and distribution of mutations are consistent with the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude</z:e> is caused by haploinsufficiency of interferon regulatory factor 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome-associated mutations suggests a different, though not mutually exclusive, effect on interferon regulatory factor 6 function </plain></SENT>
