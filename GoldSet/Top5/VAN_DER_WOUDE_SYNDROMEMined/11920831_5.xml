<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we present a family with Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome (RHS) that manifests MCT, and use this rare finding to suggest that RHS may be related not only to phenotypically similar syndromes, but seemingly dissimilar ones as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RHS has obvious phenotypic overlap with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000968'>ectodermal dysplasia</z:hpo>-clefting syndromes (EDCS), such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100257'>ectrodactyly</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000968'>ectodermal dysplasia</z:hpo>-clefting syndrome (EEC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009755'>ankyloblepharon</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000968'>ectodermal dysplasia</z:hpo>-clefting syndrome (AEC), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which show MCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCT is also found in the allelic disorders <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">van der Woude syndrome</z:e> (VDW) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal-pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome (PPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, while VDW and PPS have little clinical overlap with the EDCS, the common finding of MCT may indicate closer relationships at the developmental or genetic level </plain></SENT>
