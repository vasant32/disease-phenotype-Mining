<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that genes regulated by IRF6 are also involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000202'>oral clefting</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used five criteria to identify potential IRF6 target genes; differential gene expression in skin taken from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and Irf6-deficient murine embryos, localization to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> 2 (VWS2) locus at 1p36-1p32, overlapping expression with Irf6, presence of a conserved predicted-binding site in the promoter region, and a mutant murine phenotype that was similar to the Irf6 mutant mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously, we observed altered expression for 573 genes; 13 were located in the murine region syntenic to the VWS2 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of these genes, Wdr65 and Stratifin, met 4 of 5 criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wdr65 was a novel gene that encoded a predicted protein of 1,250 amino acids with two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WD</z:e> domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As potential targets for Irf6 regulation, we hypothesized that disease-causing mutations will be found in WDR65 and Stratifin in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>-like syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified a potentially etiologic missense mutation in WDR65 in a person with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> who does not have an exonic mutation in IRF6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression and mutation data were consistent with the hypothesis that WDR65 was a novel gene involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000202'>oral clefting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
