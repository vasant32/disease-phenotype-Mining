<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This report describes the clinical and genetic features of two large and unrelated families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> in Brazil, emphasizing the range of anomalies found within and between the families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Family 1 included 54 descendants spanning five generations, with 12 (22.23%) individuals manifesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In family 2, examinations comprised 17 descendants distributed over four generations, and 8 (47.06%) people presented features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In family 1, the first two generations were not affected, but the other three generations had affected members showing a unique association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100267'>lip pits</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>/palate with equilibrated gender distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In family 2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> generations were affected, and the clinical expression of disease was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, including members with isolated clefts, isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100267'>lip pits</z:hpo>, and association of <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>/palate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100267'>lip pits</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both families, affected members transmitted their traits to descendants in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> with apparent low penetrance in family 1, but high penetrance in family 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated surgically by cheiloplasty and/or palatoplasty with satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> was transmitted by an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> pattern with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003828'>variable expressivity</z:hpo> and penetrance and equilibrated gender distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Physicians should be aware of the variety of malformations that can be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genetic counseling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> affected families is important, because a high percentage of descendants can have some kind of clefting </plain></SENT>
