<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Distinguishing characteristics include <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100267'>lip pits</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000668'>hypodontia</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence, and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> mode of transmission with a high degree of penetrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> locus was mapped to a 1.6-cM region in 1q32-q41 between D1S491 and D1S205, and a 4.4-Mb contig of YAC clones of this region was constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current investigation, gene-based and anonymous STSs were developed from the existing physical map and were then used to construct a contig of sequence-ready <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> clones across the entire <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> STSs and BAC clones were shared with the Sanger Centre, which developed a contig of PAC clones over the same region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subset of 11 clones from both contigs was selected for high-throughput sequence analysis across the approximately 1.1-Mb region; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two of these clones have been sequenced completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over 900 kb of genomic sequence, including the 350-kb <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> critical region, were analyzed and revealed novel polymorphisms, including an 8-kb deletion/insertion, and revealed 4 known genes, 11 novel genes, 9 putative genes, and 3 psuedogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positional candidates LAMB3, G0S2, HIRF6, and HSD11 were excluded as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> gene by mutation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A preliminary gene map for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> critical region is as follows: [see text] 41-<z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data provided here will help lead to the identification of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> gene, and this study provides a model for how laboratories that have a regional interest in the human genome can contribute to the sequencing efforts of the entire human genome </plain></SENT>
