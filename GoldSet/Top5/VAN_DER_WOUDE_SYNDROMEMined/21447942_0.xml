<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Microdeletion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>) critical region is a relatively rare event, and only a few cases have been reported in the medical literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extent of the deletion and the genotype-phenotype correlation are 2 crucial issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: During analysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> critical region in 95 families with an isolated cleft of the lip with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, we found a de novo interstitial deletion of 1q32.2-q32.3 in a patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and other dysmorphic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present case showed new proximal and distal end breakpoints compared to those previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of a short tandem repeat analysis was confirmed using high resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization and showed an interstitial deletion of approximately 2.98 Mb which involved 25 genes, including the entire IRF6 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of the non-deleted allele of the IRF6 gene did not show any mutation, which supports a haploinsufficiency mechanism of the IRF6 gene in the development of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000202'>oral cleft</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present report adds to the collective knowledge that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000202'>oral cleft</z:hpo> is a major clinical feature of the 1q32.2-q32.3 deletion </plain></SENT>
