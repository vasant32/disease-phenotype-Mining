<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM AND METHOD: We analysed DNA samples isolated from individuals born with <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> to identify deletions and duplications of candidate gene loci using array comparative genomic hybridisation (array-CGH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 83 syndromic cases analysed we identified one subject with a previously unknown 2.7 Mb deletion at 22q11.21 coinciding with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002538'>DiGeorge syndrome</z:mp> region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of the syndromic cases had clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> and deletions were identified in five of these, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which encompassed the interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a series of 104 non-syndromic cases we found one subject with a 3.2 Mb deletion at chromosome 6q25.1-25.2 and another with a 2.2 Mb deletion at 10q26.11-26.13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses of parental DNA demonstrated that the two deletion cases at 22q11.21 and 6q25.1-25.2 were de novo, while the deletion of 10q26.11-26.13 was inherited from the mother, who also has a <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These deletions appear likely to be causally associated with the phenotypes of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> receptor 1 (ESR1) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) genes from the 6q25.1-25.2 and 10q26.11-26.13, respectively, were identified as likely causative genes using a gene prioritization software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have shown that array-CGH analysis of DNA samples derived from <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate subjects is an efficient and productive method for identifying candidate chromosomal loci and genes, complementing traditional genetic mapping strategies </plain></SENT>
