<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main clinical manifestations are popliteal webbing, <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000196'>lower lip pits</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo>, and genital and nail anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report describes the clinical features in two families with PPS and one isolated case, showing the range of anomalies found both within and between the families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PPS has some features in common with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>), also inherited as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> condition, with <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>/palate and, more distinctively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000196'>lower lip pits</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> has not yet been identified, it has been localised to within 1.6 cM in the region 1q32-41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine whether PPS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> represent allelic forms of the same gene, three families were genotyped for markers flanking and within the critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multipoint lod score of 2.7 was obtained, with no evidence of recombination, supporting the hypothesis that these two disorders are allelic </plain></SENT>
