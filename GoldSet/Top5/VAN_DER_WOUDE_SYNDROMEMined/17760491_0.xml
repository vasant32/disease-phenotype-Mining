<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Multidisciplinary cleft-craniofacial team within a tertiary care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> were identified from hospital records as having <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and/or palate surgery performed at the University of Iowa, and six of these patients underwent simple surgical excision of lower lip sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of postoperative complications and number of surgeries required per patient for correction of lower lip defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six patients undergoing surgical excision of lip sinuses had postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026683" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mucocele</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These uniformly required one or two further surgeries for correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no other complications associated with the procedures and no patient had a pre- or postoperative whistling deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cosmetic outcome was thought to be satisfactory in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the overall improvement in cosmetic appearance following simple surgical excision of congenital lower lip sinuses, the high rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026683" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mucocele</z:e> formation and repeat surgery has led to cautious preoperative counseling regarding the risks and benefits of the procedure </plain></SENT>
