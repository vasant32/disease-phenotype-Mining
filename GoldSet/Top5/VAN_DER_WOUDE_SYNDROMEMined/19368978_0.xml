<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To report two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> lateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_623'>synechia</z:mpath> (CPLS) syndrome in a single family and describe surgical closure using the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_623'>synechia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Case report and literature review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case report is presented with a review of the literature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> in conjunction with lateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_623'>synechia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation with photographic images of surgical repair is presented as well as a genetic workup with pedigree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 6-week-old male presented for evaluation of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mucosa-lined, fibromuscular tissue bands were noted connecting the floor of mouth and the free edges of a bilateral complete secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No other craniofacial, digital, genital or limb defects were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient's 13-month-old sister had similar synechial bands and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another older sibling had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_623'>synechia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient's mother and maternal great grandmother had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palates</z:hpo> at birth without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_623'>synechia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The three children share a common mother but have three different fathers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis failed to reveal chromosomal defects or a mutation in the interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) gene, a locus linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At 2 years of age, the index patient was growing and feeding well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>His intra-oral bands remained intact and were incorporated in the surgical repair using a novel approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Since more otolaryngologists are performing cleft surgeries, the awareness of the differential diagnoses associated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CPLS is an extremely rare condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The report of this family supports the suspected pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003828'>variable expressivity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The unusual surgical approach will be discussed </plain></SENT>
