<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The lower lip was examined in 397 children with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> (CP), in 518 <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> children with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> (CL(P)) and in 1000 noncleft children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Familial occurrence of clefts, other concomitant anomalies and the type and extension of the cleft were determined from the child's medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 323 orthopantomograms, taken at the ages of 6-12 years, were available in the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000668'>hypodontia</z:hpo> of the permanent teeth excluding the third molars in the CP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of lower lip sinus and microforms (conical elevations, CE) was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of sinuses was 2.3% in the CP group, 2.5% in the CL(P) group and 0% in the noncleft group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The corresponding figures for CE were 39.3%, 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the CP group with CE, the familial occurrence of clefts was statistically higher (30.0%) than in the group without CE (20.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The corresponding figures for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000668'>hypodontia</z:hpo> were 40.7% and 24.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conical elevations are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> related disturbances in the development of the lower lip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At least in certain cases the CE do represent microforms of the sinus syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="?"><plain>Thus the question arises: do the CE always represent microforms of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e>, or are they only pathogenic similarities of a variable etiology </plain></SENT>
