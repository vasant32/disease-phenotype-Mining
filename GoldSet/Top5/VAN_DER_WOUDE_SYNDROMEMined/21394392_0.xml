<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thin section of Araldite resin embedded congenital fistulae of the lower lip of four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> from the Hospital de Reabilitação de Anomalias Craniofaciais da Universidade de São Paulo, Bauru, SP, were analyzed with a transmission electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the glands were mostly made by typical mucous acini exhibiting, with certain frequency, myoepithelial cells surrounding them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some of lobules, a few acini smaller than the typical mucous, showed granules of moderate electron density or containing a dense core or exhibiting small dense spherule and predominance granular material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These granules resemble to described recently by others in various human minor salivary glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We concluded that glands associated with congenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> of lower lip of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e>, in spite of being located in vermilion border of the lip, showed at the transmission electron microscope characteristics of labial minor salivary gland, i.e, are mostly mucous with a few seromucous units, while typical seromucous demilunes are not present </plain></SENT>
