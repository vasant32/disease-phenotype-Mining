<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify mutations of interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>) patients in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> families were screened to IRF6 gene mutation via PCR and sequence techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After amplification of exons 1-8 and their flanking splice junctions and part of exon 9 of the IRF6 gene by polymerase chain reaction, mutations were detected by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three novel mutations, one in each family, were identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the affected members in the three families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were one missense mutation 1214 (T--&gt;C) in exon 9, two nonsense mutations 981 (T--&gt;A) in exon 7 and 1234 (C--&gt;T) in exon 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> affected members of the three families were heterozygous for their respective mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mutations in IRF6 gene were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This observation supports the hypothesis that IRF6 is the gene responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> across different populations </plain></SENT>
