<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>, which has <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo>, is highly variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both the occurrence of CL/P and CP within the same genealogy and a recurrence risk &lt;40% for CP among descendants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> have suggested that the development of clefts in this syndrome is influenced by modifying genes at other loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we have conducted linkage analysis in a large Brazilian kindred with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>, considering as affected the individuals with CP, regardless of whether it is associated with other clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that a gene at 17p11.2-11.1, together with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> gene at 1p32-41, enhances the probability of CP in an individual carrying the two at-risk genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If this hypothesis is confirmed in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> pedigrees, it will represent one of the first examples of a gene, mapped through linkage analysis, which modifies the expression of a major gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It will also have important implications for genetic counseling, particularly for more accurately predicting recurrence risks of clefts among the offspring of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
