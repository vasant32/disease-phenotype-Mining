<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its etiology is multifactorial; some are a result of a genetic mutation, while others may be due to environmental factors, with genetic predisposition playing an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence varies widely between populations and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interferon regulatory factor-6 (IRF6) gene has been shown to harbor mutations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">van der Woude syndrome</z:e>, a dominant form of clefts associated with small pits of the lower lip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover IRF6 has been associated with nonsyndromic cleft of the palate (CL/P) in two separate studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of IRF6 in a set of 195 trios from Belgium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cleft occurred as an isolated feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We studied association of the IRF6 locus using two variants: one in the IRF6 gene and the other 100 kpb 3' of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our independent study group confirms that the IRF6 locus is associated with nonsyndromic <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> with or without palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This result, with previous studies performed in the United States and Italy, shows for the first time the implication of IRF6 in isolated CL/P in northern Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is likely that association to this locus can be identified in various populations and that the IRF6 locus thus represents an important genetic modifier for this multifactorial malformation </plain></SENT>
