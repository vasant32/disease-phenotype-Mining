<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under these structural constraints, which require both regular secondary structure and a hydrophobic core, protein aggregation is an unavoidable corollary to protein structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, as aggregation results in reduced fitness, natural selection will tend to eliminate strongly aggregating sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis of distribution and variation of aggregation patterns in the human proteome using the TANGO algorithm confirms the findings of a previous study on several proteomes: the flanks of aggregation-prone regions are enriched with charged residues and proline, the so-called gatekeeper-residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in this study, we observed a widespread redundancy in gatekeeper usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, aggregating regions from key proteins such as p53 or huntingtin are among the most extensive "gatekept" sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, mutations that remove gatekeepers could therefore result in a strong increase in disease-susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a set of disease-associated mutations from the UniProt database, we find a strong enrichment of mutations that disrupt gatekeeper motifs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Closer inspection of a number of case studies indicates clearly that removing gatekeepers may play a determining role in widely varying disorders, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">van der Woude syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002986" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fabry disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
