<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000679'>taurodontism</z:hpo> in a clinical sample of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>) and describe its association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000668'>hypodontia</z:hpo> and cleft type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional study was carried out on chart reviews and radiographs of 13 persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 10 years 11 months +/- 1 year 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Panoramic radiographs were used to confirm the presence or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026644" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">absence of teeth</z:e> and to measure crown body and root lengths of mandibular first molars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography (CT) scans were available on two persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both volumetric and linear measurements were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000679'>taurodontism</z:hpo> of the mandibular first molar was 35%: 27% hypodont and 8% mesodont </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 13 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>, 6 (4 males and 2 females) had at least one tooth identified with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000679'>taurodontism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Half of the cases were unilateral and half were bilateral, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the unilateral cases were on the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five of the six subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000679'>taurodontism</z:hpo> had missing incisors and premolars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000679'>Taurodontism</z:hpo> was two times more frequent in those who were missing their second premolars than in those who had their second premolars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between cleft type and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000679'>taurodontism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cone beam CT pilot study on two persons showed very abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of both crown and roots, which was not apparent on the standard panoramic radiograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both the volumetric and linear measurements of the ratio of crown body to root were highly indicative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000679'>taurodontism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further genetic studies are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a likely association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000679'>taurodontism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
