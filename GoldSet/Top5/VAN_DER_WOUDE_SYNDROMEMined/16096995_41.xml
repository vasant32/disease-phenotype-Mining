<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While there have been a number of attempts to identify the genes responsible for this disorder, the results have not been consistent among populations and no single gene has been identified as playing a major susceptibility role </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, Zucchero et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>[2004: N Engl J Med 351:769-780] detected an association between SNPs in IRF6 and NSCLP in a number of different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subsequent study by Scapoli et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>[2005: Am J Hum Genet 76:180-183] confirmed this association in an Italian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We examined the same SNPs as Scapoli et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>[2005] in our large, well-characterized sample of NSCLP families and trios, and also detected an altered transmission of IRF6 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This additional confirmation further strengthens the IRF6 association and suggests that IRF6 plays a role in NSCLP susceptibility </plain></SENT>
