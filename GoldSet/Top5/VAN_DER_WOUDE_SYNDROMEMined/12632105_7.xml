<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Very recently, mutations in the interferon regulatory factor 6 gene (IRF6) were identified to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> in patients of northern European descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a Thai family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proband, an 8-month-old boy, had bilateral complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate, and two conical elevations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100267'>lip pits</z:hpo> on his lower lip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four other family members had various manifestations of the clefts and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000196'>lower lip pits</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis of the proband and his mother for the entire coding region of IRF6 identified a novel mutation, 1234del(C), in its exon 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The deletion is expected to result in some amino acid changes followed by truncation at amino acid 435 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This observation supports that IRF6 is the gene responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> across different populations and that haploinsufficiency of the gene disturbs development of the lip and palate </plain></SENT>
