<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients underwent early surgical release of interalveolar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0154933" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">synechiae</z:e> under general anesthesia through fiberscopic nasal intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 2 patients were treated at the ages of 6 and 14 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interincisival distances increased from 5 and 6 mm preoperatively to 11 and 10 mm immediately after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was increased further to 25 and 20 mm at long-term follow-up (6 and 24 months).In conclusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0154933" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">synechiae</z:e> between the upper and lower jaws can be safely treated at a very early age under general anesthesia with fiberscopic nasotracheal intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purpose of early intervention in these cases is to facilitate oral feeding and prevent temporomandibular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">joint ankylosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
