<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is very likely that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to this malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene for interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) have been shown to be the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e>, a dominant disorder that has CL/P as a common feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been reported that genetic polymorphisms at the IRF6 locus are associated with nonsyndromic CL/P, with stronger association in Asian and South American populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated four markers spanning the IRF6 locus, using the transmission/disequilibrium test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A sample of 219 Italian triads of patients and their parents were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strong evidence of linkage disequilibrium was found between markers and disease in both single-allele (P=.002 at marker rs2235375) and haplotype (P=.0005) analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings confirm the contribution of IRF6 in the etiology of nonsyndromic CL/P and strongly support its involvement in populations of European ancestry </plain></SENT>
