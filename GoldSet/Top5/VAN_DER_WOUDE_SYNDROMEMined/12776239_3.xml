<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It combines lower lip sinuses with a <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and/or palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The asymmetry appears more pronounced due to lower lip <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> and procheilia, which are more unaesthetic than the fistulae themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The malformation of the orbicularis oris muscle in its medial part induces the hypotonic aspect of the lower lip, which contrasts with the retracted scarred upper lip after the cleft has been repaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is also responsible for a real bilabial asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For many years, the most common surgical treatment was simple excision of the sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bad functional repair results prompted the authors to try another surgical procedure, the split-lip advancement technique as described by Mutaf </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors report here on 8 operated children out of 25 patients followed up for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They evaluated the results according to the appearance of the lip when relaxed, its functional aspect, and the satisfaction of the parents or the child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results point to the importance of early surgical treatment, radical excision of dysplastic tissue and the repair of lip muscles to restore good lip functionality and satisfactory bilabial symmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The technique now used in our department has made it possible for us to achieve these goals </plain></SENT>
