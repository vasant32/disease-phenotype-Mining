<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This project investigated the contribution of IRF6 to NSCLP in the Honduran population, a previously unstudied group with a high prevalence of NSCLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Family-based joint linkage and association study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A set of five SNPs in and around IRF6 previously reported to be associated with NSCLP were tested for association with NSCLP in 276 affected and unaffected Honduran individuals from 59 families with at least two members affected by clefting and at least one member with confirmed NSCLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed support of linkage for three SNPs-rs1856161, rs2235371, and rs2235377-under a dominant model (log of odds [LODs] = 1.97, 1.56, 1.73, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent single-point, haplotype, and joint linkage and association analyses continued to support the association with NSCLP (P &lt; or = .05) at these three SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When analysis was restricted to NSCLP cases, excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> only cases, support for association strengthened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate that three candidate SNPs within IRF6 are significantly associated with NSCLP in the Honduran population, providing the first genetic clue to NSCLP observed in the Honduran population and confirming findings from populations in other parts of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to identify the putative variant(s) </plain></SENT>
