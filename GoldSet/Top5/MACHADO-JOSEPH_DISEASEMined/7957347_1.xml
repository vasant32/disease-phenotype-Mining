<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>Cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> was evaluated by a five-step rating scale as defined on X-ray computed tomography (X-CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with ten age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (mean cerebellar CBF +/- SD: 66.9 +/- 6.6 ml/100 g/min), rCBF in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> was significantly decreased in the cerebellum (mean +/- SD: 50.2 +/- 7.3 ml/100 g/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant relationship, however, was found between the decrease in rCBF in the cerebellum and the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> on X-CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rCBF in the cerebellum was minimally decreased in one patient who had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> and in two patients with moderate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data may support the findings that Purkinje cells in the cerebellum are almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e>, and that the granular and molecular layers remain intact in spite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> of the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that [123I]-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPET is able to identify pathological and metabolic changes in the cerebellum that do not appear on X-CT or magnetic resonance imaging, and thus is useful for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
