<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal region of the protein includes a polyglutamine stretch that is expanded in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on the analysis of an ataxin-3 mutant mouse that has been obtained by gene trap integration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ataxin-3 fusion protein encompasses 259 N-terminal amino acids including the Josephin domain and an ubiquitin-interacting motif but lacks the C-terminus with the polyglutamine stretch, the valosin-containing protein binding region and part of the ubiquitin-interacting motif 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homozygous ataxin-3 mutant mice were viable and showed no apparent anatomical defects at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, at the age of 9 months, homozygous and heterozygous mutant mice revealed significantly altered behaviour and progressing deficits of motor coordination followed by premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at ∼12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At this time, prominent extranuclear protein aggregates and neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was found in mutant mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was associated with disturbances of the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated unfolded protein response, consistent with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> role of ataxin-3 in endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the ataxin-3 gene trap model provides evidence for a contribution of the non-polyglutamine containing ataxin-3 N-terminus, which mimics a calpain fragment that has been observed in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the disease in humans, gene trap mice develop cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and implicate impaired unfolded protein response in the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
