<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proteins were examined from skin fibroblast cultures and brain homogenates from the frontal cerebral cortex, putamen, and cerebellum </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proteins from homogenates of the cerebral cortex, putamen, and cerebellum from controls differed from those of one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two major classes of proteins were increased in the patient's putamen and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proteins of 40,000 and 50,000 daltons--including the glial filamentous acidic protein complex (molecular weight 50,000), and two proteins which migrated near actin--were increased in the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The glial filamentous acidic protein complex increased 3.7-fold in the putamen of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These protein changes probably represent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>, but may also be an expression of the primary genetic mutation </plain></SENT>
