<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this family of disorders, a normally polymorphic CAG repeat becomes expanded, resulting in expression of an expanded polyglutamine domain in the disease gene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental models of polyglutamine disease implicate the nucleus in pathogenesis; however, the link between intranuclear expression of expanded polyglutamine and neuronal dysfunction remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that ataxin-3, the disease protein in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, adopts a unique conformation when expressed within the nucleus of transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal antibody 1C2 is known preferentially to bind expanded polyglutamine, but we find that it also binds a fragment of ataxin-3 containing a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> glutamine repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, expression of ataxin-3 within the nucleus exposes the glutamine domain of the full-length non-pathological protein, allowing it to bind the monoclonal antibody 1C2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fractionation and immunochemical experiments indicate that this novel conformation of intranuclear ataxin-3 is not due to proteolysis, suggesting instead that association with nuclear protein(s) alters the structure of full-length ataxin-3 which exposes the polyglutamine domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This conformationally altered ataxin-3 is bound to the nuclear matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pathological form of ataxin-3 with an expanded polyglutamine domain also associates with the nuclear matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that an early event in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> may be an altered conformation of ataxin-3 within the nucleus that exposes the polyglutamine domain </plain></SENT>
