<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relative frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> among SCA has previously been estimated at about 50% in the Chinese population and has been reported to be related to the frequency of large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles in some populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Taq polymerase has been used for PCR in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> and expanded alleles of ATXN3 were detected via PCR using LA Taq DNA polymerase (better for GC-rich sequences) and denaturing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis in 150 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and 138 unrelated probands from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> SCA families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To compare reaction efficiency, 12 MJD patients' expanded alleles were amplified with La Taq and Taq polymerase respectively in the same amplifying systems and reaction conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> alleles ranged from 12 to 42 CAG repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common allele contained 14 repeats with a frequency of 23.3%, which corroborates previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles (&gt;27 repeats) was 0.28, which was very high relative to previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> in SCA patients was 72.5%, which was significantly higher than those in previous reports about the Chinese and other Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This frequency was one of the highest reported worldwide, with only Portuguese and Brazilian populations exhibiting higher proportions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 expanded alleles were amplified in PCR with La Taq polymerase, whereas only 2 expanded alleles were amplified with Taq polymerase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have first reported the highest relative frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> in Asia, and we attribute this high frequency to a more efficient PCR using LA Taq polymerase and hypothesized that large ANs may act as a reservoir for expanded alleles in the Southeastern Chinese population </plain></SENT>
