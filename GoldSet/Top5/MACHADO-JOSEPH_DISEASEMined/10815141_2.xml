<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinical descriptions of the dominantly inherited ataxic motor syndromes in a 7-generation family of German origin were first reported in 1951 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To provide follow-up clinical, pathological, and genetic data for 9 patients in this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Clinical histories and neurologic findings, gross and microscopic pathological features, and DNA analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical presentations in this closely followed up portion of the family include fairly uniform ataxic and upper motor neuron symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>Nystagmus</z:hpo> was a conspicuous and early sign, but generational anticipation was not evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although often present, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>amyotrophy</z:hpo> was not a major source of disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major pathological degeneration was noted in the pons, spinal cord, and upper brainstem, where ubiquitin-immunoreactive intranuclear inclusion bodies were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> [spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3] genotype) was established from autopsy tissue in 1 patient and from blood specimens in 6 others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical variation within this family and between this family and families with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> genotypes is so broad as to make the genetic diagnosis from clinical criteria alone practically impossible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pathological definition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> is more reliable, but some findings do overlap those of other genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, the basis for the phenotypic variations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>, genetic or otherwise, has not been established </plain></SENT>
