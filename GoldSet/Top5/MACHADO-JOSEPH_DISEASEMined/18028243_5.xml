<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive RR intervals were analyzed for time- and frequency-domain parameters in 22 genotypically proven SCA patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> = 11, SCA2 = 6 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> = 5) and compared with that of age- and gender-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reduction in the standard deviation of RR interval (RR_SD) was seen in 72.7% of SCA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a reduction in both the parasympathetic and sympathetic parameters in SCA without any change in the ratio of low- to high-frequency power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>, there was a significant negative correlation between RR_SD and duration of illness but not with the CAG repeat lengths of the abnormal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small sample size of SCA2 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> precluded similar comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo>, predominantly parasympathetic, was seen in SCA, and the severity correlated with the duration of illness in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> </plain></SENT>
