<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were assessed with a rating scale for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo> and met the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was 37.8, SD 13.4 years and the duration of the disease was 7.4, SD 4.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte GDH activity was significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.001) when compared to 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data extend previous reports indicating that a GDH deficiency is present in peripheral tissues from some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002503'>spinocerebellar degenerations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this study suggests that a genetic deficiency of GDH may underlie some forms of dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo>; this deficiency may be marked in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> and is not specific for any type of multiple system <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
