<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the 1C2 antibody which specifically recognizes large polyglutamine tracts, particularly those that are expanded, we recently reported the detection of proteins with pathological glutamine expansions in lymphoblasts from another form of ADCA type I, SCA2, as well as from patients presenting with the distinct phenotype of ADCA type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now have screened a large series of patients with ADCA or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>isolated cases</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo>, for the presence of proteins with polyglutamine expansions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 150 kDa SCA2 protein was detected in 16 out of 40 families with ADCA type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This corresponds to 24% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ADCA type I families, which is much more frequent than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> in this series of patients (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The signal intensity of the SCA2 protein was negatively correlated to age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, as expected for an expanded and unstable trinucleotide repeat mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The disease segregated with markers closely linked to the SCA2 locus in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identified SCA2 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, a specific 130 kDa protein, which segregated with the disease, was detected in lymphoblasts of patients from nine families with ADCA type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was also visualized in the cerebral cortex of one of the patients, demonstrating its translation in the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, no new disease-related proteins containing expanded polyglutamine tracts could be detected in lymphoblasts from the remaining patients with ADCA or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>isolated cases</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
