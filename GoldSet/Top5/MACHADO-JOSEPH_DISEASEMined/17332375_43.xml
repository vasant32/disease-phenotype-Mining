<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show that a Drosophila model for the CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) disease spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 recapitulates key features of human CAG-repeat instability, including large repeat changes and strong expansion bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Instability is dramatically enhanced by transcription and modulated by nuclear excision repair and a regulator of DNA repair <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein-a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (HAT) whose decreased activity contributes to polyQ disease </plain></SENT>
