<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> is based on the toxic function of the mutant ataxin-3 protein, but the exact mechanism of the disease remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various types of transgenic mouse models explore different aspects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> pathogenesis, but a knock-in humanized mouse has not yet been created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial aim of this study was to generate an ataxin-3 humanized mouse model using a knock-in strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The human cDNA for ataxin-3 containing 69 CAG repeats was cloned from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patient and introduced into the mouse ataxin-3 locus at exon 2, deleting it along with exon 3 and intron 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the human transgene was inserted correctly, the resulting mice acquired the knock-out properties and did not express ataxin-3 protein in any analyzed tissues, as confirmed by western blot and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression revealed that the entire locus consisting of human and mouse exons was expressed and alternatively spliced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We detected <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> isoforms composed of exon 1 spliced with mouse exon 4 or with human exon 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After applying 37 PCR cycles, we also detected a very low level of the correct exon 1/exon 2 isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we confirmed by bioinformatic analysis that the structure and power of the splicing site between mouse intron 1 and human exon 2 (the targeted locus) was not changed compared with the native mouse locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that these splicing aberrations result from the deletion of further splicing sites and the presence of a strong splicing site in exon 4, which was confirmed by bioinformatic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, we created a functional ataxin-3 knock-out mouse model that is viable and fertile and does not present a <z:mp ids='MP_0002083'>reduced life span</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our work provides new insights into the splicing characteristics of the Atxn3 gene and provides useful information for future attempts to create knock-in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> models </plain></SENT>
