<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The number of CAG repeats in the expanded alleles accounts only for 50 to 75 % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> variance, the remaining variation being dependent on other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differential allelic expression of ATXN3 could contribute to the explanation of different ages at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in patients displaying similar CAG repeat sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variation in 5' regulatory regions of the ATXN3 gene may have the potential to influence expression levels and, ultimately, modulate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main goal of this work was to analyze the extent of sequence variation upstream of the ATXN3 start codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A fragment containing the core promoter and the 5' untranslated region (UTR) was sequenced and analyzed in 186 patients and 59 controls (490 chromosomes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the core promoter, no polymorphisms were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 5' UTR, only one SNP (rs3814834) was found, but no improvements on the explanation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> variance were observed, when adding its allelic state in a linear model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, in silico analysis predicted that this SNP lays in a nonconserved position for CMYB binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, no functional effect could be predicted for this variant </plain></SENT>
