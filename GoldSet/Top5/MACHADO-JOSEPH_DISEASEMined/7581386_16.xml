<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present linkage analysis on a large Swedish five-generation family of 15 affected individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> (ADCA) associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000546'>retinal degeneration</z:hpo> and anticipation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Common clinical signs in this family include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001141'>severely impaired vision</z:hpo> with the phenotype ADCA type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Different subtypes of ADCA have proven difficult to classify clinically due to extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> within and between families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis of a number of ADCA type I families shows that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> exists also genetically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the last few years several types of ADCA type I have been localized and to date six genetically distinct forms have been identified including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> (6p), SCA2 (12q), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) (14q), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA4</z:e> (16q), and finally <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA5</z:e> (11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed a genome-wide search of the Swedish ADCA type II family using a total of 270 microsatellite markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive lod scores were obtained with a number of microsatellite markers located on chromosome 3p12-p21.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three markers gave lod scores over 3 with a maximum lod score of 4.53 achieved with the marker D3S1600 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ADCA type II gene could be restricted to a region of 32 cM by the markers D3S1547 and D3S1274 </plain></SENT>
