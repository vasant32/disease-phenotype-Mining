<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Linear hyperintensity along the medial margin of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) on T2-weighted images from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) was recently reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to compare the prevalence of this linear hyperintensity between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson disease</z:e>, and in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report the prevalence of linear hyperintensity along the GPi in 10 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, 38 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>), and 25 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the prevalence of linear hyperintensities on T2-weighted axial images in these groups, and in nearly age-matched subjects younger than 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed statistical analysis using the chi(2) test and Fisher exact test to compare the prevalence of the hyperintensity in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of the linear hyperintensity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> was significantly higher than that in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and in control subjects (P = .014 and .006, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subjects younger than 60 years, the prevalence of the hyperintensity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> was significantly higher than that in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and control subjects (P = .011 and P &lt; .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control subjects, the linear hyperintensity tended to be greater in subjects older than 60 years (8/14 [57%] patients) than in subjects younger than 60 years (2/11 [18%] patients; P = .058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>, the prevalence did not differ between patients older than 60 years and patients younger than 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Linear hyperintensity along the globus pallidus is frequently found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, but it can be also found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and in control subjects, probably because of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging process </plain></SENT>
