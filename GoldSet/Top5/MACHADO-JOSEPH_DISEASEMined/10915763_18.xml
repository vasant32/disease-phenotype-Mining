<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although repeat length and age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> are inversely related, approximately 50% of the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> variance in SCA2 remains unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other familial factors have been proposed to account for at least part of this remaining variance in the polyglutamine dis-orders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability of polyglutamine tracts to interact with each other, as well as the presence of intra-nuclear inclusions in other polyglutamine disorders, led us to hypothesize that other CAG-containing proteins may interact with expanded ataxin-2 and affect the rate of protein accumulation, and thus influence age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we used step-wise multiple linear regression to examine 10 CAG-containing genes for possible influences on SCA2 age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One locus, RAI1, contributed an additional 4.1% of the variance in SCA2 age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> after accounting for the effect of the SCA2 expanded repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This locus was further studied in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>), but did not have an effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This result implicates RAI1 as a possible contributor to SCA2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> and raises the possibility that other CAG-containing proteins may play a role in the pathogenesis of other polyglutamine disorders </plain></SENT>
