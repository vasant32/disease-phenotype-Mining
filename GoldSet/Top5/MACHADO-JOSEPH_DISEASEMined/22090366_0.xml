<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the body mass index (BMI) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and to assess the correlations with clinical, molecular, biochemical, and neuroimaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A case-control study with 46 SCA3/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients and 42 healthy, non-related control individuals with similar age and sex was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation was done with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> scales SARA and NESSCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and magnetic resonance imaging normalized volumetries of cerebellum and brain stem were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BMI was lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients when compared to controls (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMI was associated with NESSCA, expanded CAG repeat number (CAG)n, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, age, disease duration, and serum insulin levels; however, in the linear regression model, (CAG)n was the only variable independently associated with BMI, in an inverse manner (R = -0.396, p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this report, we present evidence that low BMI is not only present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, but is also directly related to the length of the expanded CAG repeats, which is the causative mutation of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association points that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> might be a primary disturbance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, although further detailed analyses are necessary for a better understanding of the nutritional deficit and its role in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
