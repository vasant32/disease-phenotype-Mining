<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the overall survival of a large series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients and compared it with the survival of their asymptomatic relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 412 affected and 413 unaffected individuals were ascertained from a consecutive sample of 82 families with a molecular diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Estimated mean survival time was 63.96 years [95% confidence interval (CI), 62.09-65.83] for the affected group and 78.61 years (95% CI, 74.75-82.47) for the unaffected group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
