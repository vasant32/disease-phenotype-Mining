<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its omnipause neurons gate the activity of the burst neurons for vertical saccades lying within the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle and that for horizontal saccades residing in the caudal subnucleus of the pontine reticular formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated the RIP in five patients with clinically diagnosed and genetically confirmed spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>), also known as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">Polyethylene glycol</z:chebi>-embedded 100 microm serial sections stained for lipofuscin pigment and Nissl material as well as paraffin-embedded Nissl stained thin sections revealed the hitherto overlooked involvement of this pontine nucleus in the degenerative process underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, whereby in four of our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients the RIP underwent a conspicuous loss of presumed omnipause neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As observed in other affected brain structures, the RIP of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients displayed reactive astrocytes and activated microglial cells, while some of the few of its surviving neurons harbored an ataxin-3-immunopositive intranuclear inclusion body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings of the present pathoanatomical study suggest that (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in the brain stem of terminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients is more widespread than previously thought and is not confined to cranial nerve nuclei involved in the generation of saccades but likewise involves the premotor network for saccades and (2) damage to the RIP may contribute to slowing of horizontal saccades in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients but is not associated with saccadic oscillations as occasionally speculated </plain></SENT>
