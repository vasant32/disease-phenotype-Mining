<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The protein ataxin-3 consists of an N-terminal globular Josephin domain (JD) and an unstructured C-terminal region containing a stretch of consecutive glutamines that triggers the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorder</z:e> spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3, when it is expanded beyond a critical threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease results from misfolding and aggregation, although the pathway and structure of the aggregation intermediates are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to provide insight into the mechanism of the process, we monitored the aggregation of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (AT3Q24) ataxin-3, an expanded (AT3Q55) ataxin-3, and the JD in isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them aggregated, although the latter did so at a much slower rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the expanded AT3Q55 displayed a substantially different behavior with respect to the two other variants in that at the latest stages of the process it was the only one that did the following: i) lost its reactivity towards an anti-oligomer antibody, ii) generated <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-insoluble aggregates, iii) gave rise to bundles of elongated fibrils, and iv) displayed two additional bands at 1604 and 1656 cm(-1) in FTIR spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although these were previously observed in other aggregated polyglutamine proteins, no one has assigned them unambiguously, yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By H/D exchange experiments we show for the first time that they can be ascribed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50331">glutamine side-chain</z:chebi> hydrogen bonding, which is therefore the hallmark of irreversibly <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-insoluble aggregated protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FTIR spectra also showed that main-chain intermolecular hydrogen bonding preceded that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50331">glutamine side-chains</z:chebi>, which suggests that the former favors the latter by reorganizing backbone geometry </plain></SENT>
