<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied nine genetically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients and eight age-matched healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were obtained during self-paced fast extensions of the wrist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EEG epochs were time-locked to electromyography (EMG) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or offset of the voluntary EMG burst and averaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients, the early Bereitschaftspotential (early BP, -1500 to -500ms) was not affected but the late BP was reduced over the central midline area and contralaterally to the movement side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amplitude of the fpMP, a post-movement MRCP component, was also reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the offset cortical potential in the first 500ms after EMG offset (Moff+500) was attenuated bilaterally over a wide cortical area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that cortical activations associated with the initiation and termination of a voluntary movement are impaired in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Abnormalities of pre- and post-movement MRCP components provide researchers with pathophysiological insight into voluntary motor dysfunction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
