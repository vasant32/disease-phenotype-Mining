<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight disorders have been previously identified with expansion of a CAG repeat in the protein coding sequence of the disease gene, resulting in pathological expansion of a glutamine tract in the mutated protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of this common mutation suggests that a similar mechanism may underlie <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies1 have shown that mutated protein accumulates in the nuclei of neurons from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e>, and spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 1, and in transgenic mice expressing mutated ataxin-1 or an amino-terminal fragment of mutated huntingtin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These ubiquitinated intranuclear inclusions contain fibrillar aggregates which form amyloid-like structures in model systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Large intranuclear aggregates have been observed in neurons and glia in another rare multisystem <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> known as neuronal intranuclear <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inclusion disease</z:e> (NIID).2, 3 and 4 This disorder usually affects the young with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by the third decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and familial cases have been described, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients often present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal signs</z:hpo>, lower motor neuron abnormalities, and cognitive or behavioural dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurons of the central, peripheral, and autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems show eosinophilic, ubiquitinated intranuclear inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The similarities between this disease and the CAG repeat disorders prompted us to examine whether expanded polyglutamine tracts could be identified in NIID.Necropsy was done on a 25-year-old woman who died after a 6-year course initially characterised by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000496'>abnormal eye movements</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002322'>resting tremor</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001276'>increased muscle tone</z:hpo>, and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003487'>extensor plantar response</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although cognitive function was intact, there was a history of behavioural abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no known family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Her symptoms progressed to akinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> with occasional dystonic posturing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Postmortem examination revealed widespread eosinophilic ubiquitinated intranuclear inclusions, most readily identifiable within large neurons (figure a, b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Rare (about 1%) nuclear inclusions stained with mononuclonal antibody 1 C2 (figure c), which recognises pathologically expanded polyglutamine tracts.5 </plain></SENT>
