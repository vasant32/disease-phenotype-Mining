<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3 is a member of the polyglutamine family of proteins, which are associated with at least nine different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the disease state, expansion of the polyglutamine tract leads to dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of neurons, as well as formation of proteinaceous aggregates known as nuclear inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, both expanded and non-expanded forms of ataxin-3 are observed within these nuclear inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3 is the smallest of the polyglutamine disease proteins and in its expanded form causes the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorder</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a non-pathological variant containing 28 residues in its polyglutamine tract, we have probed the folding and misfolding pathways of ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We describe here the first equilibrium folding pathway delineated for any polyglutamine protein and show that ataxin-3 folds reversibly via a single intermediate species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have also explored further the misfolding potential of the protein and found that partial destabilization of ataxin-3 by chemical denaturation leads to the formation of fibrillar aggregates by the non-pathological variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results provide an insight into the possible mechanisms by which polyglutamine expansion may affect the stability and conformation of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The implications of this are considered in the wider context of the development and pathogenesis of polyglutamine diseases </plain></SENT>
