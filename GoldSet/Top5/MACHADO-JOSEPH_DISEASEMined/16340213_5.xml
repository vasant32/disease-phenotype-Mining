<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The number of CAG motifs in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene was determined in a representative sample of 1000 unrelated individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Associations between the repeat size and the epidemiological representation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The allelic profile of the total sample was in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (13-41 repeats), with mode (CAG)23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No intermediate alleles were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allelic size distribution showed a negative skew </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correlation between the epidemiological representation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> in each district and the frequency of small, medium and large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further correlations performed grouping the districts also failed to produce significant results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The absence of association between the size of the repeats and the representation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> demonstrates that prevalence is not an indirect reflection of the frequency of large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Globally the results obtained are in accordance with a model that postulates the occurrence of a few mutations on the basis of most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> cases worldwide </plain></SENT>
