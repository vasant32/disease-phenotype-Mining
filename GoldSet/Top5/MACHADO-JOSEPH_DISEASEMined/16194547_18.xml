<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Machado-Joseph's disease is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion that is translated into an abnormally long polyglutamine tract in the protein ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Except for the polyglutamine region, proteins associated with polyglutamine diseases are unrelated, and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these diseases aggregates containing these proteins are the major components of the nuclear proteinaceous deposits found in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aggregates of the expanded proteins display amyloid-like morphological and biophysical properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human ataxin-3 containing a non-pathological number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32677">glutamine residues</z:chebi> (14Q), as well as its Caenorhabditis elegans (1Q) orthologue, showed a high tendency towards self-interaction and aggregation, under near-physiological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to understand the discrete steps in the assembly process leading to ataxin-3 oligomerization, we have separated chromatographically high molecular mass oligomers as well as medium mass multimers of non-expanded ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that: (a) oligomerization occurs independently of the poly(Q)-repeat and it is accompanied by an increase in beta-structure; and (b) the first intermediate in the oligomerization pathway is a Josephin domain-mediated dimer of ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, non-expanded ataxin-3 oligomers are recognized by a specific antibody that targets a conformational <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> present in soluble cytotoxic species found in the fibrillization pathway of expanded polyglutamine proteins and other amyloid-forming proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Imaging of the oligomeric forms of the non-pathological protein using electron microscopy reveals globular particles, as well as short chains of such particles that likely mimic the initial stages in the fibrillogenesis pathway occurring in the polyglutamine-expanded protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, they constitute potential targets for therapeutic approaches in Machado-Joseph's disease, as well as valuable diagnostic markers in disease settings </plain></SENT>
