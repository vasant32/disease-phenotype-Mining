<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3, the protein involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>, is able to bind ubiquitylated substrates and act as a deubiquitylating enzyme in vitro, and it has been involved in the modulation of protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C. elegans and mouse ataxin-3 knockout models are viable and without any obvious phenotype in a basal condition however their phenotype in stress situations has never been described.Considering the role of ataxin-3 in the protein degradation pathway, we analyzed the effects of heat shock, a known protein homeostasis stressor, in C. elegans ataxin-3 (ATX-3) knockout animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that ATX-3 mutants have an exacerbated stress response and survive significantly better than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> animals when subjected to a noxious heat shock stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This increased thermotolerance of mutants was further enhanced by pre-exposure to a mild heat shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At a molecular level, ATX-3 mutants have a distinct transcriptomic and proteomic profile with several molecular chaperones abnormally up-regulated during heat shock and recovery, consistent with the observed resistance phenotype.The improved thermotolerance in ATX-3 mutants is independent of heat shock factor 1, the maestro of the heat shock response, but fully dependent on DAF-16, a critical stress responsive transcription factor involved in longevity and stress resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also show that the increased thermotolerance of ATX-3 mutants is mainly due to <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-16.2, C12C8.1 and F44E5.5 given that the knockdown of these heat shock proteins using <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference causes the phenotype to revert </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This report suggests that the absence of ATX-3 activates the DAF-16 pathway leading to an overexpression of molecular chaperones, which yields knockout animals with an improved capacity for dealing with deleterious stimuli </plain></SENT>
