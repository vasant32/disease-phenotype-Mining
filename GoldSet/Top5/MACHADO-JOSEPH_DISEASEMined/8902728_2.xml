<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four patients had type I and three had type II disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Findings were compared with those obtained in 14 age-matched controls, 8 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e>, 7 patients with multiple system <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CSF level of substance P was significantly (p = 0.0000) lower in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, being 44.5% of the control value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the mean CSF levels of substance P in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e>, multiple system <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> did not differ significantly from that in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The alteration in the CSF level of substance P may be related to the neurological impairment observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
