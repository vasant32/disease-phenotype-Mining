<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The pathological CAG triplet repeat expansions of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>, SCA2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e>, SCA12 and SCA17 genes were analyzed in a cohort of 559 Mainland Chinese patients affected by spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, including 363 probands from families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> SCA and 196 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, recombinant DNA technology by T-vector cloning and direct sequencing were performed to detect the CAG-repeat number of abnormal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 559 SCA patients, twenty-three were positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>, the ranges of expanded CAG repeats were from 39 to 60 (mean:51.09+/-4.88); thirty-two were positive for SCA2, the ranges of expanded CAG repeats were from 36 to 51 (mean:40.34+/-4.40); three hundred and five were positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, the ranges of expanded CAG repeats were from 49 to 86 (mean:73.84+/-5.07); nine were positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e>, the ranges of expanded CAG repeats were from 23 to 29 (mean:25.56+/-1.94); twenty-seven were positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e>, the ranges of expanded CAG repeats were from 38 to 71(mean:58.22+/-10.90); three were positive for SCA12, the ranges of expanded CAG repeats were from 51 to 52 (mean:51.33+/-0.58); and finally, two were positive for SCA17, the range of expanded CAG repeats were from 53 to 55 (mean:54.00+/-1.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The 39 CAG repeats of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>, 49 CAG repeats of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> and 51 CAG repeats of SCA12 are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the shortest known causative expanded alleles, while the 86 CAG repeats of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> is the largest full expanded allele that has never been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is the first report of SCA17 subtype in Mainland Chinese and first research that established the abnormal reference standard of CAG repeat number of different subtypes of SCA in Chinese Han </plain></SENT>
