<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unclear whether Onuf's nucleus (ON), which plays major roles in the micturition reflex and voluntary continence, degenerates during the disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we conducted a morphometric and immunohistochemical study of ON, together with the lateral nuclear group (LNG) of the sacral anterior horns, in seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When compared with controls, the number of lower motor neurons in both ON and LNG was significantly smaller in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients, the former being inversely correlated with the size of the expanded CAG repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients with a large CAG-repeat expansion showed an ON-predominant pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, while in the remaining patients, ON and LNG were affected to a similar degree, or rather an LNG-predominant pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, when adjusted for age, the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in both ON and LNG was significantly correlated with the extent of expansion of the CAG repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, the remaining lower motor neurons in ON often exhibited ataxin-3- or 1C2-immunoreactive (ir) <z:mp ids='MP_0004191'>neuronal intranuclear inclusions</z:mp>, while no pTDP-43-ir neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were present in these neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present findings strongly suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in ON, the degree of which is highly influenced by the extent of expansion of CAG repeats, is a consistent feature in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
