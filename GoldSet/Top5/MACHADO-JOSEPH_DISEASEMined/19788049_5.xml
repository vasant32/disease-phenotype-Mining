<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the immunocytochemical findings of an initial post-mortem study using a specific antibody against the disease protein of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> (i.e., pathologically altered alpha-1A subunit of the P/Q type voltage-dependent calcium channel, CACNA1A) have not been confirmed so far, the occurrence and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system distribution of neuronal protein aggregates in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> is still a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Owing to the fact that the antibody against the pathologically altered CACNA1A is not commercially available, we decided to apply a recently generated p62 antibody on brain tissue from two clinically diagnosed and genetically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Application of this p62 antibody revealed numerous cytoplasmic neuronal inclusions in the degenerated cerebellar dentate nucleus and inferior olive of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> patients studied, whereby a subset of these aggregates were also ubiquitin-immunopositive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In view of the known role of p62 in protein degradation as well as aggresome/sequestosome formation, the p62 aggregate formation observed in the present study suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> not only is associated with an impairment of the calcium channel function and an elongated polyglutamine stretch in CACNA1A, but also with a defective protein handling by the protein quality control system </plain></SENT>
