<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This implies that the protein context of expanded polyQ plays an important role in establishing selective neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, in studies of the spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 disease protein ataxin-3, we demonstrate that the protein sequence surrounding polyQ specifies the constituents of nuclear inclusions (NI) formed by the disease protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nuclear proteins cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and Mastermind-like-1 strongly colocalize only to NI formed by full-length ataxin-3, whereas the splicing factor SC35 colocalizes only to NI formed by a polyQ-containing, carboxyl-terminal fragment of ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These differences in NI formation reflect specific protein interactions normally undertaken by ataxin-3, as both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant full-length ataxin-3 co-immunoprecipitate with CBP and sediment on density gradients as macromolecular complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ataxin-3 represses cAMP response element-binding protein-mediated transcription, indicating a functional consequence of ataxin-3 interactions with CBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that mutant ataxin-3 forms insoluble intranuclear complexes, or microaggregates, before NI can be detected, implying a precursor-product relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that protein context-dependent recruitment of nuclear proteins to intranuclear microaggregates, and subsequently to NI, may contribute to selective neurotoxicity in polyQ diseases </plain></SENT>
