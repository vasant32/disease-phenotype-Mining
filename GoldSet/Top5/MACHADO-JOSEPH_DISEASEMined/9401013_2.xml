<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The repeat expansion detection (RED) method was described to detect expansions of trinucleotide repeats of unknown chromosomal location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have improved the RED method by the use of 8-mer oligonucleotides and assessed its usefulness in 30 samples from patients with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), and Machado Joseph's disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>), for which the number of CAG/CTG repeats was determined by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation between the number of repeats detected by sequencing and those identified by RED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in 17% of samples, the RED gave additional fragments for ligation products of different size than the CAG/CTG repeat expansion detected in the sample by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same was observed in a group of control subjects (n = 78) without known clinical abnormalities in which products of more than 40 repeats were detected in 27% of them, indicating that CAG/CTG repeat expansions are common in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wether this corresponds to unidentified loci with expansions deserves further investigation </plain></SENT>
