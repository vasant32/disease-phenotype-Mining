<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The misfolding and formation of fibrillar-like aggregates by polyglutamine proteins is believed to be a key factor in the development of the neurodegenerative polyglutamine diseases; however, relatively little is known about structural and conformational aspects of polyglutamine-induced misfolding and aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is largely attributable to the fact that polyglutamine proteins have proved difficult to purify in quantities suitable for biochemical and biophysical analyses, thus limiting the extent to which the proteins can be conformationally characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent advances, however, have seen the development of a number of protocols enabling the expression and purification of these proteins in more significant quantities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe a purification protocol for ataxin-3, which, in its polyglutamine-expanded form, causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Purification of different length ataxin-3 variants, including one of pathological length, is facilitated by an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag, which enables binding to a <z:chebi fb="152" ids="28112">nickel</z:chebi>-chelated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> resin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A key issue that arose during purification was the undesirable proteolysis of ataxin-3 by a trace contaminant protease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We solved this problem by the addition of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41033">benzamidine</z:chebi>-binding step during purification, which greatly reduced the level of proteases present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that the inclusion of this step had a significant positive impact on the quality of the purified protein product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also inactivated trace amounts of proteases during experiments by the addition of specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, we also describe initial structural and functional analyses that confirm the integrity of the purified protein </plain></SENT>
