<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increased levels of these proteins could either be a consequence of a relative increase in their de novo synthesis or result from altered rates of proteolysis in degenerating brain cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These alternatives can be distinguished by comparing the in vitro protein-synthetic capacities of the messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> populations isolated from cerebellar cortex of control subjects and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein H (glial fibrillary acidic protein) is synthesized at detectable levels by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> isolates, and the levels of its translatable messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> are reproducibly increased in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33697">ribonucleic acids</z:chebi> isolated from cerebellar cortex of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> as compared with those isolated from cerebellar cortex of control subjects </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to these results, there is no detectable synthesis of proteins J and L by messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> populations isolated from cerebellar cortex of either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> patients or control subjects, suggesting that the increased levels of these proteins in affected cerebellar cortex are a consequence of posttranslational protein modifications </plain></SENT>
