<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two patients and one three generation family with interstitial deletions of distal chromosome band 14q31 are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The deletions were initially identified by chromosome analysis; we have used highly informative simple sequence repeat polymorphisms to define the deletions at the molecular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This analysis also establishes the parental origin of the deleted chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the patients was initially described as having a terminal deletion of chromosome 14 from 14q31 to 14qter; we show here that this child has instead an interstitial deletion of band 14q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The smallest deletion involves a single anonymous DNA marker and is associated with an almost <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two patients with larger deletions have phenotypes similar to those seen in previously described cases of interstitial deletions of chromosome 14, including minor dysmorphic features and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Delineation of these deletions allows the ordering of markers within the 14q31 region, in which the gene for the degenerative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorder</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> is localised </plain></SENT>
