<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate and compare the international cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> rating scale (ICARS) and the unified multiple system <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> rating scale (UMSARS) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed 52 consecutive subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> using each scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both scales had adequate internal consistency (alpha &gt; 0.90), except for the oculomotor (OD) subscore (alpha = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> had the highest scores in both scales, and symptoms other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> clearly confounded the total ICARS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a very strong correlation between the ICARS and UMSARS-II (motor function), and the correlations between the ICARS and UMSARS-I (r = 0.79) (history) and UMSARS-IV (r = 0.69) (disability) were also statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no significant changes in scores after a mean interval of 7.7 months, although there was after a mean interval of 13.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the total ICARS score is a reliable method for longitudinal evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, but a disease specific scale should be developed </plain></SENT>
