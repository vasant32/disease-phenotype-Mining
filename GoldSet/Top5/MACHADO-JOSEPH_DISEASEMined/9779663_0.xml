<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> with a high prevalence in the islands of Azores (Portugal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genetic epidemiological studies presently under way in these islands are based on the genealogical reconstruction of the affected families, thus partially depending on the reference of patients using family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A considerable effort has been made to obtain genealogies that are as complete as possible, making use of different types of data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The utility of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> causes contained in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> registers of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> was determined in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the extent to which the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> reported in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> register can confirm other reports of an individual's status for the disease (ie, oral information), and to determine the accuracy of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates in <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> in patients whose disease was clinically diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> registers of 113 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> (82 whose disease was identified by history and 31 whose disease was clinically diagnosed) were examined and compared with those of controls matched by sex and date and place of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significant differences in the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> between cases and controls, both for those whose disease was identified by history (chi(2) = 51.69, P &lt; .001) and for those whose disease was identified by examination (chi(2) = 27.78, P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was in accord with the presence of the disease in only 40% of the cases reported as being identified only by family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the cases in which the disease was clinically diagnosed, only nearly 38% of the registers provided reliable information as to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> being the direct cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The fact that only nearly 40% of the patients with clinically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> had a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> compatible with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> precludes the use of cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as a means of identifying affected individuals in the Azorean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> pedigrees </plain></SENT>
