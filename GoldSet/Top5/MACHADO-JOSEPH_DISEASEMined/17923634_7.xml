<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> is the most frequent dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite its frequency and presence in many populations, only 2 founder mutations have been suggested to explain its current geographic distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To trace back in history the main mutational events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>, we aimed to assess ancestral haplotypes and population backgrounds, to date the mutations, and to trace the routes and time of introduction of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotypes in different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Design, Setting, and PARTICIPANTS: We studied 264 families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> from 20 different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six intragenic single-nucleotide polymorphisms were used to determine ancestral mutational events; 4 flanking short tandem repeats were used to construct extended haplotypes and measure accumulation of genetic diversity over time within each lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The worldwide-spread lineage, TTACAC, had its highest diversity in the Japanese population, where we identified the ancestral short tandem repeat-based haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accumulated variability suggested a postneolithic mutation, about 5774 +/- 1116 years old, with more recent introductions in North America, Germany, France, Portugal, and Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As to the second mutational event, in the GTGGCA lineage, only 7 families (of 71 families) did not have Portuguese ancestry, although gene diversity was again smaller in Portuguese families (0.44) than in non-Portuguese families (0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The worldwide-spread mutation may have first occurred in Asia and later been diffused throughout Europe, with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect accounting for its high prevalence in Portugal; the other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> lineage is more recent, about 1416 +/- 434 years old, and its dispersion may be explained mainly by recent Portuguese emigration </plain></SENT>
