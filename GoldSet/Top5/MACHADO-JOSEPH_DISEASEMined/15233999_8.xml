<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This encodes the protein ataxin-3, of unknown function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mouse Mjd gene has a structure similar to that of its human counterpart and it also contains a TATA-less promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its 5' flanking region contains conserved putative binding regions for transcription factors Sp1, USF, Arnt, Max, E47, and MyoD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon differentiation of P19 cells, the Mjd gene promoter is preferentially activated in endodermal and mesodermal derivatives, including cardiac and skeletal myocytes; and less so in neuronal precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mouse ataxin-3 is ubiquitously expressed during embryonic development and in the adult, with strong expression in regions of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> affected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is particularly abundant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of muscle and in ciliated epithelial cells, suggesting that it may be associated with the cytoskeleton and may have an important function in cell structure and/or motility </plain></SENT>
