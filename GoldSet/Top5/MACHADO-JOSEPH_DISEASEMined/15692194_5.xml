<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The short-term impact of the pre-symptomatic genetic test (PT) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) in the Azores (Portuguese Islands) was assessed in 46 individuals at risk who completed the PT Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Scores for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> were used as indicators of the subjects' emotional status immediately before the PT and 1 year after disclosure of the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Global levels of participation in the Azorean PT Program for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> were high (20.7%), particularly in Flores Island (35.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the total sample, mean scores of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> before and after the PT presented without clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No differences were found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> scores before and after the PT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when grouped by test results (carriers/non-carriers), there were no differences between pre- and post-test levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the test result did not cause a decrease in the psychological well-being of the individuals tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high number of participants performing the PT in the small and isolated community of Flores Island, where <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> represents a source of stigma, was interpreted as an indication that in this particular population the PT offers the individuals at risk the possibility of liberating from a stigma, and, hence, from exclusion </plain></SENT>
