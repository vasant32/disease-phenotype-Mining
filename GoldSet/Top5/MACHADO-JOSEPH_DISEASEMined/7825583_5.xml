<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The gene locus of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) has recently been mapped within a 29-cM subregion of 14q chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We did a linkage study of 24 multigenerational <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> Japanese pedigrees, in an attempt to narrow the candidate region of this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pairwise and multipoint linkage analysis, together with haplotype segregation analysis, led to the conclusion that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene is located at the 6.8-cM interval between D14S256 and D14S81 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">Zmax</z:chebi> = 24.78, multipoint linkage analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>D14S291 and D14S280, located at the center of this interval, showed no obligate recombination with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">Zmax</z:chebi> = 5.93 for D14S291 and 9.99 for D14S280) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A weak, but significant, linkage disequilibrium of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene was noted with D14S81 (P &lt; .05) but not with D14S291 or D14S280 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a 3.6-cM interval flanked by D14S291/D14S280 and D14S81 is the most likely location of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene and that it is closest to D14S81 </plain></SENT>
