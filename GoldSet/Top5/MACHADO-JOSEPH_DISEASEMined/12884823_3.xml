<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A clinical evaluation of 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) was performed by using an acoustic analysis soft (SoundScope, GW Instruments Inc) before and on 4 weeks of treatment of taltirelin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> (TH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A rapid repetitive monosyllable/ka/was recorded as the samples were analyzed in a computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The repetition period (ms) and the maximum intensity (volt) was measured from the sound spectrogram and the amplitude envelope for each speech wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three acoustic parameters, which were mean of period (ms) (m-P), coefficient of variation of period (%) (CV-P), and coefficient of variation of amplitude (%) (CV-A), were calculated according to Ishida's acoustic analysis method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average age in this study group was 52.4 +/- 11.4 years (32-73 years), the mean scores of International Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> Rating Scale (ICARS) was 35.0 +/- 18.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant correlation was shown between CV-A and ICARS scores before therapy (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CV-P was decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) from 10.9 +/- 0.12% to 9.2 +/- 0.26% after TH, and its degree of decrement correlated with ICARS scores (p &lt; 0.05), which means a greater effect of TH is expected in patients with milder symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ICARS scores did not change with a statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TH was shown to be effective on the ataxic speech of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> by quantitative methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The acoustic analysis used in this study is a sensitive and objective evaluation method for following up the clinical severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and judging effectiveness of a drug </plain></SENT>
