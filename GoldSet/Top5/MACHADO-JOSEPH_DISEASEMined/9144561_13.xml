<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The existence of an abnormal gene product in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> was previously suggested with the expanded polyglutamine stretch-specific antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the product of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele has not previously been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We generated monoclonal antibodies against the fusion protein (codon 225-310) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene product and then identified the MJD1 gene product in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoblastoid cells as a approximately 50-kDa protein by immunoblot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The electrophoretic mobility differences among the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele products corresponds to the molecular size difference produced by the polyglutamine stretch and the polymorphism at the C-terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, abnormal immunoreactive bands which were larger than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ones were found as a approximately 60-kDa protein exclusively in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cytoplasm and the nuclei of neurons and glial cells were stained by these antibodies with immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As in other CAG repeat diseases, the abnormal and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele products were almost equally expressed in lymphoblastoid cells and the brain of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
