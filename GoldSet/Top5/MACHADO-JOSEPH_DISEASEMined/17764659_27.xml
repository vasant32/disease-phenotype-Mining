<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physiological functions of ATXN3 presumably include ubiquitin protease and transcriptional corepressor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the function of ATXN3 and to test the hypothesis that loss of ATXN3 contributes to the pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> we generated Atxn3 knockout (ko) mice by targeted mutagenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Loss of Atxn3 did not affect viability or fertility and Atxn3 ko mice displayed no overt abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the accelerating Rotarod Atxn3 ko mice performed as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> (wt) animals, but reduced exploratory behavior in the open field suggested a sense of heightened <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While no gross deficits were apparent upon morphological examination, we found increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins in Atxn3 ko tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus Atxn3 ko mice provide the first in vivo reference to the deubiquitinating activity of ATXN3 </plain></SENT>
