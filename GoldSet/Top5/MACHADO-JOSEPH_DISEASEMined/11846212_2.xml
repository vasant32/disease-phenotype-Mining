<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genetic analyses were done in 29 patients with dominant SCA and 5 patients with SCA with negative family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> was identified in 41.3% of the cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> 17.2%, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (DRPLA) 6.9% and unknown 34.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence is clearly different from those of Miyagi and Yamagata Prefectures as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> has not been identified in our region, and is in fact similar to that of Hokuriku or Kanto Provinces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An apparent difference in the incidence of each SCA may be attributed to the historical and geographic regional difference in the distribution of inhabitants and also to the small size of the SCA population we have so far investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 2 of the 3 genetically identified DRPLA in this study were not clinically diagnosed, and one of them was thought to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>Late onset</z:hpo> DRPLA may thus be misdiagnosed to other disease categories, when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was not apparent at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
