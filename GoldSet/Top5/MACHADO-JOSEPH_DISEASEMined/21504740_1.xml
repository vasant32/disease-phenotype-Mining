<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that aggregation and stability of the nonpathological form of ataxin-3, carrying an unexpanded polyQ tract, are modulated by its N-terminal Josephin domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was also shown that expanded ataxin-3 aggregates via a two-stage mechanism initially involving Josephin self-association, followed by a polyQ-dependent step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite this recent progress, however, the exact mechanism of ataxin-3 fibrilization remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we have used electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and other biophysical techniques to characterize the morphological and mechanical properties of nonexpanded ataxin-3 fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By comparing aggregates of ataxin-3 and of the isolated Josephin domain, we show that the two proteins self-assemble into fibrils with markedly similar features over the temperature range 37-50Â°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Estimates of persistence length and Young's modulus of the fibrils reveal a great flexibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that, under physiological conditions, during early aggregation Josephin retains a nativelike secondary structure but loses its enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest a key role of Josephin in ataxin-3 fibrillar aggregation </plain></SENT>
