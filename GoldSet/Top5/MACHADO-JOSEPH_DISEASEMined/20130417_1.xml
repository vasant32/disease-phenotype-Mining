<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Our purpose was to use <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the available data to describe the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo> in a long-term cohort of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> through a markovian method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients were recruited between 1998 and 2005 and were invited to annual neurological follow-ups until 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>Gait ataxia</z:hpo> was described through a mean score graph and a mean trajectory graph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We followed up 105 patients; at baseline, the mean age and disease duration were, 40.5 (SD = 12.6) and 7.7 (SD = 5.8) years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean time to reach stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo> were 3, 5.4, 10.8 and 19.4 years of disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean score graph was unsmooth, showing several unlikely ups and downs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean trajectory graph produced a continuous curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The markovian method described the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo> without any a posteriori adjustment of data and allowed statistical comparisons between subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This method will be useful in future clinical trials in this and in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
