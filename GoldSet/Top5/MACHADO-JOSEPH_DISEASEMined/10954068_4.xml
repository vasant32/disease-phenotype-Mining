<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used iodine123-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy and sympathetic skin response to study autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> functions in 19 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) and 20 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Planar imaging of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the participants was done to evaluate myocardial scintigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ratio of average counts in the heart to average counts in the mediastinum was calculated for both early and delayed images, the latter of which reflects the cardiac neural uptake of the tracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography also was done on 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> to examine regional tracer uptake to the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean ratio of counts in the heart to counts in the mediastinum in the delayed images was lower for the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> than for the control subjects (p &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormal sympathetic skin response was present in 6 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> whose mean ratio of counts in the heart to counts in the mediastinum was lower than that of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sympathetic skin response (p &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography study showed significantly lower accumulation of the tracer in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> than in the control subjects in the anterior lateral sectors predominantly innervated by sympathetic nerves but not in the inferior septal sectors reported to be under main innervation by parasympathetic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> is accompanied by cardiac sympathetic dysfunction, as detected by iodine123-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy, which appears to be correlated with sudomotor sympathetic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
