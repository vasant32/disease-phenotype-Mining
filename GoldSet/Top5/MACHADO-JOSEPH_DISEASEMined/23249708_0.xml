<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of the current research is to understand if the different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000496'>eye movement abnormalities</z:hpo> in patients with the same neurologic disease are related to varied disease processes or, alternately, do different patients adopt different strategies to overcome a singular brain deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a magnetic search coil, we measured saccade dynamics, that is position and velocity waveforms, for patients diagnosed with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (SCA-3), also known as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed that the saccadic waveform of the majority of the SCA-3 patients (7 of 10) exhibited dynamic overshoot, with the eye passing the desired endpoint and making a rapid correction before coming to rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> waveforms, that is with no dynamic overshoot, had saccades with relatively low peak velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Velocity feedback in a closed loop control system is essential for providing a fast response without overshoot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lack of a velocity feedback or an imbalance between position and velocity gains yields a tradeoff between response time and overshoot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While the goal of a saccade is to get to the desired position, models based on animal research suggest that the saccadic control also incorporates a velocity feedback </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results presented here indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SCA-3 patients had deviations in the saccadic waveform, albeit of two types, either <z:hpo ids='HP_0000514'>slow saccades</z:hpo> or dynamic overshooting saccades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using saccadic models based on animal research can explain how a single deficit, that is a mismatched velocity control of the motor error due to the disease, can yield these two different abnormalities in human patients </plain></SENT>
