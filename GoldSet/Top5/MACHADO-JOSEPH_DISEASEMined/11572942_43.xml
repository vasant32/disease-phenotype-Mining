<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The protein ataxin-3 contains a polyglutamine region; increasing the number of glutamines beyond 55 in this region gives rise to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This disease and other polyglutamine expansion diseases are characterized by large intranuclear protein aggregates (nuclear inclusions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using full-length human ataxin-3, we have investigated the changes in secondary structure, aggregation behavior, and fibril formation associated with an increase from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> length of 27 glutamines (Q27 ataxin-3) to a pathogenic length of 78 glutamines (Q78 ataxin-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Q78 ataxin-3 aggregates strongly and could be purified only when expressed with a solubility-enhancing fusion-protein partner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A marked decrease in alpha-helical secondary structure accompanies expansion of the polyglutamine tract, suggesting destabilization of the native protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proteolytic removal of the fusion partner in the Q78 protein, but not in the Q27 protein, leads to the formation of <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-resistant aggregates and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo-red</z:chebi> reactive fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infrared spectroscopy of fibrils reveals a high beta-sheet content and suggests a parallel, rather than an antiparallel, sheet conformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We present a model for a polar zipper composed of parallel polyglutamine beta-sheets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data show that intact ataxin-3 is fully competent to form aggregates, and posttranslational cleavage or other processing is not necessary to generate a misfolding event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data also suggest that the protein aggregation phenotype associated with glutamine expansion may derive from two effects: destabilization of the native protein structure and an inherent propensity for beta-fibril formation on the part of glutamine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="37997">homopolymers</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
