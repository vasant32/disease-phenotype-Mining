<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A research program was undertaken to study the origin and spread of the mutant gene in the Azorean populations </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Azorean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients are grouped in 34 families and are distributed on 4 of the 9 Azore islands </plain></SENT>
