<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the functions of circadian neurons, we added two strategies to the standard Drosophila behavioral genetics repertoire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first was to express a polyglutamine-expanded neurotoxic protein (MJDtr78Q; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>) in the major timeless (tim)-expressing cells of the adult brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These Tim-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> flies were viable, in contrast to the use of cell-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> gene expression for tim neuron inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, they were more arrhythmic than flies expressing other neurotoxins and had low but detectable tim <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second extended standard microarray technology from fly heads to dissected fly brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By combining the two approaches, we identified a population of Tim-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>-affected <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some had been previously identified as sex-specific and relevant to courtship, including <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> localized to brain-proximal fat-body tissue and brain courtship centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we found a decrease in the number of neurons that expressed male-specific forms of the fruitless protein in the laterodorsal region of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The decrease was not a consequence of toxic protein expression within these specialized cells but a likely effect of communication with neighboring TIM-expressing neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data suggest a functional interaction between adjacent circadian and mating circuits within the fly brain, as well as an interaction between circadian circuits and brain-proximal fat body </plain></SENT>
