<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and forty-eight patients admitted to the Nagoya University Hospital during the period of 1976 to 1990 were dealt with </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They had been followed-up for 15 years at longest through the medical records, or through the direct informations from the patients or their family members or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to find factors influencing the survival of the patients, Kaplan-Meier method was used as the 1st step to construct the survival curve for each factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These were calculated by generalized Wilcoxon test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Employing Cox's proportional hazard model, a multivariate analysis was then performed based on the factors which were shown significant in the 1st step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis showed that the following four factors are related to the prognosis of SCD patients, i.e., lack of hereditary trait, existence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo>, lack of walking disorder at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and lack of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these factors, the lack of hereditary trait had the most intimate relation to their poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these four factors are statistically informative to predict prognosis of each patient with SCD </plain></SENT>
