<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few reports on brain single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging (BSI) with hexylmethylpropylene amineoxine labled with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi> Tc 99m and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been performed for the evaluation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate possible abnormalities with BSI and MRI in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and to correlate these findings with the duration of symptoms; cerebellar, extrapyramidal, and pyramidal syndromes; and the molecular characteristics of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients (8 males and 4 females [mean age, 39 years]) with genetically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent BSI and MRI on the same day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain SPECT imaging was performed after an intravenous injection of 99mTc-hexylmethylpropylene amineoxine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The transaxial, coronal, and sagittal BSIs obtained were submitted to visual and semiquantitative analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in a 2-T system with coronal, sagittal, transaxial, and 3-dimensional (volumetric) acquisitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The volumes of the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Control groups for BSI (22 female and 20 male subjects [mean age, 33 years]) and MRI (13 female and 4 male subjects [mean age, 32.2 years]) were included for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Correlation was observed between the perfusion abnormalities identified by visual analysis in the BSI with the structural abnormalities observed on MRI in the parietal lobes and vermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Brain SPECT imaging identified (by visual analysis) more perfusion abnormalities in the inferior portion of the frontal lobes, mesial and lateral portions of the temporal lobes, basal ganglia, and cerebellar hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging identified more abnormalities in the pons and superior portions of the frontal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Olivary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was identified by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Semiquantitative analysis showed a statistically significant difference of perfusion in the inferior and superior portions of the frontal lobes, lateral portion of the temporal lobes, parietal lobes, left basal ganglia, cerebellar hemispheres, and vermis when compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was noted between the vermis and cerebellar volumes on MRI when compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A significant relationship was observed between the perfusion of the left parietal lobe (P =.05) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency toward an inverse relationship between the duration of symptoms and the perfusion of the cerebellar hemispheres (rho = -0.37; P =.24) and volume of the vermis (rho = -0.30; P =.34); between the length of the expanded (CAG)n repeat and the perfusion of the left parietal lobe (rho = -0.32; P =.36), vermis (rho = -0.28; P =.43), and pons (rho = -0.28; P =.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A direct association was observed between the length of the expanded (CAG)n repeat and the perfusion of the lateral portion of the right temporal lobe (rho = 0.67; P =.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Brain SPECT imaging and MRI were capable of identifying subclinical abnormalities in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These findings may be helpful for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease </plain></SENT>
