<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical spectrum of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> 3 (SCA 3) disease is wide and varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a Chinese patient with a mutation at the SCA 3 locus with clinical features of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15765">levodopa</z:chebi>-responsive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The family history was suggestive of being autosomally dominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15765">Levodopa</z:chebi> responsiveness though rare has been described in families with features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Noteworthy is the relatively <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> of disease (&gt;40 years) possibly explained by the low number of affected alleles at 59, the usual range being from 62 to 86, with the lowest recorded number at 56 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This expands the wide and varied phenotypic manifestations of SCA 3, and highlights the observation that features suggestive of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15765">levodopa</z:chebi>-responsive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> (DRD) such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004373'>focal dystonia</z:hpo>, gait difficulty with diurnal fluctuation of symptoms, and a marked response to low doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15765">levodopa</z:chebi> can be presenting features of SCA 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SCA 3 should be considered a differential diagnosis in adult patients who present with DRD phenotype and with a positive family history </plain></SENT>
