<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is very important for these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo> to be clinically differentiated, but that is sometimes difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, the differential diagnosis between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> is thought to be the most difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> have been proven to be related to expansions of CAG trinucleotide in their causative genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, 20 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> in 13 unrelated Japanese families were genetically and clinically examined in comparison with 20 cases of age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>- and duration-matched Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CAG repeat number of expanded <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> alleles was 72.2 +/- 3.1 (mean +/- SD, n = 20) and 47.3 +/- 4.4 (n = 20), respectively, and each repeat size was inversely correlated with age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The repeat number in leukocytes increased from parents to children with acceleration of age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (anticipation) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, the number of CAG repeats in the expanded allele was lower in sperm than that of leukocytes, but was more in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the number of peaks in the expanded allele was greater in sperm than in leukocytes in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> (increased mosaicism level) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> was clinically characterized by a relatively higher frequency of ocular signs such as <z:mp ids='MP_0006166'>eyelid retraction</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002750'>bulging eyes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000597'>ophthalmoparesis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> in lower limbs, and sensory and urinary disturbances in contrast to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> patients except for slow eye movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the expanded CAG repeat and clinical features are correlated in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> can be differentiated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> by clinical characteristics mentioned above as well as DNA analysis </plain></SENT>
