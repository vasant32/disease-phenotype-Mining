<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The CAG trinucleotide polymorphism of the MJD1 gene was analyzed by recombinant DNA technology and DNA sequencing in 35 spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> 3/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) patients from Mainland China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The range of the CAG repeat of the 35 patients was 65-81 (mean = 72.96 +/- 4.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CAG repeats contained two CAAs and one AAG variations in the CAG motif in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients and majority of the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a CGG/GGG polymorphism at the 3' end of the CAG repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The GGG allele was consistently associated with smaller CAG repeats in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the CGG allele consistently existed in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recombinant DNA technology can stably, accurately and intuitively detect the CAG trinucleotide repeat of the MJD1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It should be used as a major technique to diagnose the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and analyze the polymorphism of CAG sequence </plain></SENT>
