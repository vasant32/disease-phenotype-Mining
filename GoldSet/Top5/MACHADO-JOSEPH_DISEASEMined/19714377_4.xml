<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> is caused by an expansion of a CAG tract at exon 10 of the ATXN3 gene (14q32.1), which encodes for ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main goal of this study was to analyze the occurrence of alternative splicing at the ATXN3 gene, by sequencing a total of 415 cDNAs clones (from 20 MJD patients and 14 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two novel exons are described for the ATXN3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six alternative splicing variants, generated by four types of splicing events, were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From those variants, 50 were not previously described, and 26 were only found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the variants (85.7%) present frameshift, which leads to the appearance of premature stop codons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven of the observed variants constitute good targets to nonsense-mediated decay, the remaining are likely to be translated into at least 20 different isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of ataxin-3 domains was assessed, and consequences of domain disruption are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates high variability in the ATXN3 gene transcripts, providing a basis for further investigation on the contribution of alternative splicing to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> pathogenic process, as well as to the larger group of the polyglutamine disorders </plain></SENT>
