<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we tested the "toxic fragment hypothesis", which predicts that proteolytic production of polyQ-containing fragments from the full-length disease protein initiates the aggregation process associated with inclusion formation and cellular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the removal of the N-terminus of polyQ-expanded ataxin-3 (AT3) is required for aggregation in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistently, proteolytic cleavage of full-length, pathogenic AT3 initiates the formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecylsulfate</z:chebi>-resistant aggregates in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although full-length AT3 does not readily aggregate on its own, it is susceptible to co-aggregation with polyQ-expanded AT3 fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, interaction with soluble polyQ-elongated fragments causes a structural distortion of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> AT3 prior to the formation of stable co-aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results establish the critical role of C-terminal, proteolytic fragments of AT3 in the molecular pathomechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, in strong support of the toxic fragment hypothesis </plain></SENT>
