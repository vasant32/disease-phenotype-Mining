<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the incidence of olivary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, we investigated morphologically the olives and their associated pathways in 20 autopsied cases: 11 cases of PSP, 3 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> and 6 cases of dentatorubropallidoluysian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (DRPLA) as control diseases that usually exhibited lesions of the cerebellofugal pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Olivary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> was observed in 5 of 11 PSP cases, but not in the other diseases, except for 1 case of DRPLA with an old <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the dentate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the olivopetal pathway, grumose degeneration of the dentate nucleus and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in the red nucleus were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with PSP and in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>Atrophy</z:mpath> and fibrillary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> of the tegmentum of the pons, including that of the bilateral central tegmental tracts, were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with PSP, more severe in the cases with hypertrophic neurons in the olives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We speculate that a lesion that involves the central tegmental tracts may play a major role in inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the olives in patients with PSP </plain></SENT>
