<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated whether variations in the expression of heat shock proteins (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>) are related to differences in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> in patients with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (SCA)3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hereto, we analysed the protein expression levels of HSPA1A (HSP70), HSPA8 (HSC70), DNAJB (HSP40) and HSPB1 (HSP27) in fibroblasts from patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HSPB1 levels were significantly upregulated in fibroblasts from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, but without relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exclusively for expression of DNAJB family members, a correlation was found with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> independent of the length of the CAG repeat expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This indicates that DNAJB members might be contributors to the variation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and underlines the possible use of DNAJB proteins as therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
