<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now show that ataxin-3, in which the abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine tract is responsible for spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>), undergoes ubiquitylation and degradation by the proteasome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mammalian E4B (UFD2a), a ubiquitin chain assembly factor (E4), copurified with the polyubiquitylation activity for ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>E4B interacted with, and thereby mediated polyubiquitylation of, ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of E4B promoted degradation of a pathological form of ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a dominant-negative mutant of E4B inhibited degradation of this form of ataxin-3, resulting in the formation of intracellular aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a Drosophila model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, expression of E4B suppressed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> induced by an ataxin-3 mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that E4 is a rate-limiting factor in the degradation of pathological forms of ataxin-3, and that targeted expression of E4B is a potential gene therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>
