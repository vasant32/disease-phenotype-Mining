<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph Disease</z:e> shows non-Mendelian features typical of other triplet repeat disorders, including clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, variable age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and anticipation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three phenotypes have been proposed (clinical types 1, 2 and 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 1 is associated with early age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and a high repeat number of the CAG sequence, and Types 2 and 3 have later <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and lower numbers of CAG repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This paper investigates whether there is selection against the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene, acting through differential survival. nuptiality and fertility associated with clinical type and age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study sample comprised 40 MJD patients from the Azores (Portugal) having fully documented reproductive histories and known dates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of married patients of each clinical type increased from 0.22 among Type 1 patients, to 0.40 in Type 2 and 0.95 in Type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and length of survival were also associated with marital status, with the married cases having later mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and longer mean survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the whole sample, clinical type was associated with fertility, with significantly fewer children born to Type 1 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among married patients clinical type was not associated with age at marriage, reproductive span or number of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No reduction of fertility was detected among married patients in whom the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> was below the age of 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The authors' interpretation of these results is that the high-repeat CAG haplotypes associated with early age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and clinical Type 1 are selected against through reduced survival and fertility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The fertility component of selection is mediated by nuptiality rather than marital fertility </plain></SENT>
