<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify and to characterize <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> in patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We observed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035258" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">restless legs syndrome (RLS)</z:e> and impaired sleep as a frequent yet unrecognized symptom in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 89 patients with genetically defined subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxias</z:hpo> were investigated for sleep history and neurologic findings according to a standardized protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nerve conduction studies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sleep was studied by overnight polysomnography in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RLS was present in 45% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients but is rare in other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RLS was a frequent but not the only cause of sleep impairment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Impaired sleep in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> is associated with older age, long-standing disease, and brainstem involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RLS tended to be more frequent in patients with clinical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo>, but RLS was not restricted to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RLS was not observed in healthy members of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RLS is a frequent and treatable cause of disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study provides evidence for the expanded CAG repeat in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> gene as a molecular factor causing RLS </plain></SENT>
