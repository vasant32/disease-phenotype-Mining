<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>E2-25K (Hip2), an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, interacts directly with huntingtin and may mediate ubiquitination of the <z:mp ids='MP_0004191'>neuronal intranuclear inclusions</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>E2-25K could thus modulate aggregation and toxicity of expanded huntingtin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that E2-25K is involved in aggregate formation of expanded polyglutamine proteins and polyglutamine-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both a truncated mutant, lacking the catalytic tail domain, as well as a full antisense sequence, reduce aggregate formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, both E2-25K mutants also reduced polyglutamine-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In postmortem brain material of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, E2-25K staining of polyglutamine aggregates was observed in a subset of neurons bearing intranuclear neuronal inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that targeting by ubiquitination plays an important role in the pathology of polyglutamine diseases </plain></SENT>
