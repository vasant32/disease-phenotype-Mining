<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cognitive and olfactory impairments have been demonstrated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>), and a possible relationship with dopaminergic dysfunction is implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is still controversy regarding the pattern of striatal dopaminergic dysfunction in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether these patients had different <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> transporter (DAT) densities as compared to healthy subjects, and correlated these data with cognitive performance and sense of smell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients and 20 control subjects were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neuropsychological assessment comprised the spatial span, symbol search, picture completion, stroop color word test, trail making test and phonemic verbal fluency test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 16-item Sniffin' Sticks was used to evaluate odor identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DAT imaging was performed using the SPECT radioligand [(99m)Tc]-TRODAT-1, alongside with Magnetic Resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> showed significantly lower DAT density in the caudate (1.34 ± 0.27 versus 2.02 ± 0.50, p &lt; 0.001), posterior putamen (0.81 ± 0.32 versus 1.32 ± 0.34, p &lt; 0.001) and anterior putamen (1.10 ± 0.31 versus 1.85 ± 0.45, p &lt; 0.001) compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The putamen/caudate ratio was also significantly lower in patients compared with controls (0.73 ± 0.038 versus 0.85 ± 0.032, p = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Even though we had only two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo>, we detected striatal dopaminergic deficits in those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations were detected between DAT density and cognitive performance or Sniffin' Sticks scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data suggests that striatal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> deficit is not involved in cognitive or sense of smell deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This finding raises the possibility of extra-striatal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and other neurotransmitter system involvement or of cerebellum <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> exerting a direct influence on cognitive and sensorial information processing in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
