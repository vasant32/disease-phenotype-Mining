<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> are triggered by proteins containing a polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch expanded beyond a critical threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these, ataxin-3 (AT3) is the causative agent of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We expressed three authentic AT3 variants in Escherichia coli: one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (AT3-Q24), one expanded (AT3-Q55) and one truncated immediately upstream of the polyQ (AT3-291Δ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, based on growth rate reduction, we quantified protein toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that AT3-Q55 and -291Δ strongly reduced the growth rate in the early stages (2-4 h), unlike AT3-Q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This correlated well with the appearance of soluble cytosolic oligomers, but not with the amount of insoluble protein in inclusion bodies (IBs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The impact of AT3-291Δ on cell growth suggests an intrinsic toxicity of the AT3 fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Besides the typical Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) signal for intermolecular β-sheets, the expanded form displayed an additional infrared signature, which was assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50331">glutamine side-chain</z:chebi> hydrogen bonding and associated with <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-insoluble fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The elongation of the latter was monitored by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This mirrors the well-known in vitro two-step aggregation pattern of expanded AT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that final aggregates of strains expressing expanded or truncated AT3 play a protective role against toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our findings suggest that the mechanisms of toxicity are evolutionarily conserved </plain></SENT>
