<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mutation responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) has been identified as an expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in a novel gene on chromosome 14q32.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CAG repeat tract is followed by C or G, and alleles are thereby divided into two types on the basis of molecular configuration, (CAG)nC and (CAG)nG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied the relationship between the repeat length and the configuration in 38 patients from 28 Japanese families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, and 31 unrelated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Japanese subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CAG repeat length in 100 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles ranged from 13 to 37 repeats, while 38 MJD patients had one expanded allele with 64 to 84 repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the expanded alleles had exclusively the (CAG)nC configuration, while both (CAG)nC and (CAG)nG were seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles, the CAG repeat tract was significantly longer in (CAG)nC than in (CAG)nG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the (CAG)nC configuration is related to repeat instability of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene </plain></SENT>
