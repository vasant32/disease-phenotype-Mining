<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3 is mainly localized in the cytoplasm; however, one hallmark of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> is the formation of ataxin-3-containing protein aggregates in the nucleus of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, it is not known how mutant ataxin-3 translocates into the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed localization assays of recently proposed and novel potential signals, functionally confirmed the activity of a nuclear localization signal, identified two novel nuclear export signals (NES 77 and NES 141), and determined crucial amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we demonstrate the relevance of the identified signals for the intracellular localization of the N- and C-terminus of ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings stress the importance of investigating the mechanisms, which influence the intracellular distribution of ataxin-3 during the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>
