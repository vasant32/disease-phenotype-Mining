<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neurotoxicity of pathogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph Disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) glutamine (Q) 78 and 127Q proteins were enhanced by the co-expression of Mo-PrP³(F)⁴in the fly eyes, while the eyes of controls flies and flies expressing Mo-PrP³(F)⁴) alone or together with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>-Q27 or 20Q proteins did not show any defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Susceptibilities to H₂O₂, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="34905">paraquat</z:chebi>, and Dithiothreitol (DTT) were altered in Mo-PrP³(F)⁴ flies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, Mo-PrP³(F)⁴ flies were significantly more susceptible to the perturbation of autophagy signaling by an autophagy inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38635">3-methyladenine</z:chebi> (3-MA), and inducer, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="48607">LiCl</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data suggest that Mo-PrP³(F)⁴ may enhance the neurotoxicity of pathogenic Poly-Q proteins by perturbing oxidative and autophagy signaling </plain></SENT>
