<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> candidate region has now been refined by linkage analysis with four new microsatellite markers (D14S256, D14S291, D14S280, and AFM343vf1) in the same two families, in which 19 additional individuals were genotyped, and in a third French family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Combined two-point linkage analyses show that the new markers, D14S280 and AFM343vf1, are tightly linked to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> locus, with maximal lod scores, at recombination fraction, (theta) = .00, of 7.05 and 13.70, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined multipoint and recombinant haplotype analyses localize the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> locus to a 3-cM interval flanked by D14S291 and D14S81 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same allele for D14S280 segregates with the disease locus in the three kindreds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This allele is frequent in the French population, however, and linkage disequilibrium is not clearly established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> locus remains within the 29-cM region on 14q24.3-q32.2 containing the gene for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>, which is clinically related to the phenotype determined by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, but it cannot yet be concluded that both diseases result from alterations of the same gene </plain></SENT>
