<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The polyglutamine domain confers toxicity on the protein Ataxin-3 leading to neuronal dysfunction and loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although modifiers of polyglutamine toxicity have been identified, little is known concerning how the modifiers function mechanistically to affect toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To reveal insight into spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type-3, we performed a genetic screen in Drosophila with pathogenic Ataxin-3-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> and identified 25 modifiers defining 18 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite a variety of predicted molecular activities, biological analysis indicated that the modifiers affected protein misfolding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that some modifiers affected protein accumulation in a manner dependent on the proteasome, whereas others affected autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Select modifiers of Ataxin-3 also affected tau, revealing common pathways between degeneration due to distinct human neurotoxic proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings provide new insight into molecular pathways of polyQ toxicity, defining novel targets for promoting neuronal survival in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
