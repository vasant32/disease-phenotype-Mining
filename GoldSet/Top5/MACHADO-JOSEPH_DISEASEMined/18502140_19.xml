<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we prepared a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> animal model by generating transgenic mice expressing polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-3-Q79 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3-Q79 was expressed in brain areas implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo>, including cerebellum, pontine nucleus and substantia nigra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3-Q79 transgenic mice displayed motor dysfunction with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age of 5-6 months, and neurological symptoms deteriorated in the following months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A prominent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> was not found in the cerebellum of 10 to 11-month-old ataxin-3-Q79 mice displaying pronounced ataxic symptoms, suggesting that instead of neuronal demise, ataxin-3-Q79 causes neuronal dysfunction of the cerebellum and resulting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test the involvement of transcriptional dysregulation in ataxin-3-Q79-induced cerebellar malfunction, microarray analysis and real-time RT-PCR assays were performed to identify altered cerebellar <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of ataxin-3-Q79 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to non-transgenic mice or mice expressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> ataxin-3-Q22, 10 to 11-month-old ataxin-3-Q79 mice exhibited downregulated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of proteins involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission, intracellular calcium signaling/mobilization or MAP kinase pathways, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A/B) receptor subunits, heat shock proteins and transcription factor regulating neuronal survival and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upregulated expressions of Bax, cyclin D1 and CDK5-p39, which may mediate neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, were also observed in ataxin-3-Q79 transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The involvement of transcriptional abnormality in initiating the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> was indicated by the finding that 4 to 5-month-old ataxin-3-Q79 mice, which did not display neurological phenotype, exhibited downregulated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of genes involved in glutamatergic signaling and signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-3 causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar dysfunction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> by disrupting the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern of gene transcriptions </plain></SENT>
