<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pons is one of the brain areas demonstrating selective degeneration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>), which is caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine stretch in the protein called ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the resultant pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> is readily recognized by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the features and natural process of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To characterize them, we analyzed the midsagittal images of the pons obtained by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found a difference in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> between the pontine base and tegmentum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>reduced size</z:mp> of the pontine tegmentum was prominent early after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No overlap was seen in the range of the area of pontine tegmentum between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The quotient of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the pontine tegmentum divided by age correlated well with the CAG repeat number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the area of the pontine base correlated negatively with disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Particularly, the size of the pontine base remained in the range of controls for a relatively long time after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the atrophic process is not uniform in the pons in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and that the different patterns of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> may be derived from the differential vulnerability in pontine structures </plain></SENT>
