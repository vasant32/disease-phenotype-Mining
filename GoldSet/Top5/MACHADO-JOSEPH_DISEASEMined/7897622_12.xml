<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can be divided into three phenotypes based on the variable combination of a range of clinical symptoms including pyramidal and extra-pyramidal features, cerebellar deficits, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003693'>distal muscle atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> is thought to be caused by mutation of a single gene which has recently been mapped, using genetic linkage analysis, to a 29 cM region on chromosome 14q24.3-q32 in five Japanese families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A second disorder, spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>), which has clinical symptoms similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, has also been linked to the same region of chromosome 14q in two French families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to narrow down the region of chromosome 14 which contains the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> locus and to determine if this region overlaps with the predisposing locus for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, we have performed genetic linkage analysis in seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> families, six of Portuguese/Azorean origin and one of Brazilian origin, using nine microsatellite markers mapped to 14q24.3-q32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results localise the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> locus in these families to an 11 cM interval flanked by the markers D14S68 and AFM343vf1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition we show that this 11 cM interval maps within the 15 cM interval containing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> locus, suggesting that these diseases are allelic </plain></SENT>
