<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorder</z:e> caused by the expansion of the polyglutamine repeat region within the ataxin-3 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mutant protein forms intracellular aggregates in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the cellular mechanisms causing toxicity are still poorly understood and there are currently no effective treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we show that administration of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (cell cycle inhibitor-779, temsirolimus) improves motor performance in a transgenic mouse model of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Temsirolimus inhibits mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> and hence upregulates protein degradation by autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Temsirolimus reduces the number of aggregates seen in the brains of transgenic mice and decreases levels of cytosolic soluble mutant ataxin-3, while endogenous <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> protein levels remain unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Temsirolimus is designed for long-term use in patients and therefore represents a possible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684309" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">disease model</z:e> and treatment paradigm, we employed a microarray approach to investigate transcriptional changes that might be important in the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This identified ubiquitin specific peptidase-15, which showed expression changes at both the messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> and protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitin specific peptidase-15 levels were also changed in mice expressing another mutant polyglutamine protein, huntingtin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In total we identified 16 transcripts that were decreased in transgenic ataxin-3 mice that were normalized following temsirolimus treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this mouse model with relatively mild disease progression, the number of transcripts changed was low and the magnitude of these changes was small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the importance of these transcriptional alterations in the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 remains unclear </plain></SENT>
