<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The observation that loss of orexin (hypocretin) neurons causes human <z:mp ids='MP_0005279'>narcolepsy</z:mp> raises the possibility that other acquired disorders might also result from loss of hypothalamic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test this possibility for body weight, mice with selective loss of melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCH was chosen to test because induced mutations of the MCH gene in mice cause <z:mp ids='MP_0003910'>hypophagia</z:mp> and leanness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice with ablation of MCH neurons were generated using toxin (ataxin-3)-mediated ablation strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mice appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but, after 7 weeks, developed <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced body weight</z:mp>, body length, fat mass, lean mass, and leptin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leanness was characterized by <z:mp ids='MP_0003910'>hypophagia</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004889'>increased energy expenditure</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To study the role of MCH neurons on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> secondary to leptin deficiency, we generated mice deficient in both ob gene product (leptin) and MCH neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Absence of MCH neurons in ob/ob mice improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo>, suggesting that MCH neurons are important mediators of the response to leptin deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data show that loss of MCH neurons can lead to an acquired leanness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This has implications for the pathogenesis of acquired changes of body weight and might be considered in clinical settings characterized by substantial weight changes later in life </plain></SENT>
