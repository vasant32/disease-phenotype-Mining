<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We investigated the frequencies of the symptoms such as "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo>, and pain," that have been reported to be associated with 5-HT1A receptor, and the effect of tandospirone <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> (tandospirone: 5-HT1A <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients received tandospirone (15-30 mg/d) for seven weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During that time, they were evaluated weekly using the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> Rating Scale (ARS) and Total Length Traveled (TLT) by Stabilimetry tests, the Self-rating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>), which in addition to evaluating their level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, also evaluated their degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo>, and a pain questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before tandospirone therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients displayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo>, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>, and leg pain was observed in 7 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in 6 patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> was observed in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In response to treatment, 7 of the 10 patients who were ataxic showed a reduction in their ARS, while 3 of 6 patients showed a reduction in their <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>, and 5 of 7 patients showed an alleviation of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> and leg pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both of the affected patients showed a marked improvement in their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A stabilimetry test could be performed in 7 patients, 5 of whom showed a reduction in TLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> are prone to manifest 5-HT1A receptor-associated symptoms, and tandospirone is a useful drug for these symptoms in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, though a double-blind study is needed </plain></SENT>
