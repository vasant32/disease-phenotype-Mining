<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> n=9, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> n=9) and 15 healthy volunteers were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was applied to segmented grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) of high-resolution T1-weighted brain volumes of each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found reduction of grey matter in the pons as well as in the vermis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> as compared to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> significant grey matter loss was found in hemispheric lobules bilaterally as well as in the vermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>White matter analysis revealed significant changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, especially in the pons, in the white matter surrounding the dentate nucleus (DN) and in the cerebellar peduncles, whereas no significant white matter reduction was found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate different patterns of grey and white matter affection detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> patients, confirming the pathological concept of cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> represents a form of ponto-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> with predominant affection of pontine nuclei and fibre tracts </plain></SENT>
