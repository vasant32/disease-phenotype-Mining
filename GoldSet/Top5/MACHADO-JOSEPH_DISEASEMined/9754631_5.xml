<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical evidence suggests that anticipation occurs in the major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the distribution of repeat sizes at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) locus in a group of patients with the major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We did not find any large expansions, though 2 patients had alleles that were two repeats larger than in our controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in allele sizes was larger in the patient sample as compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of such large differences might be of functional significance </plain></SENT>
