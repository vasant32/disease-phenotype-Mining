<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analyses of more than 100 recorded clinical items revealed several specifics: I) 50% of patients with probable MSA had asymmetry of symptoms at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002322'>tremor at rest</z:hpo> was present in 25%; II) a positive response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15765">levodopa</z:chebi> was recorded in 51% of patients identified initially with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic failure</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo>; III) a positive family history was recorded in 11% (n = 23), two of these patients were identified with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus asymmetry of symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002322'>tremor at rest</z:hpo> and a positive response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15765">levodopa</z:chebi> are not as specific for idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> as believed previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> may present with the clinical features of MSA </plain></SENT>
