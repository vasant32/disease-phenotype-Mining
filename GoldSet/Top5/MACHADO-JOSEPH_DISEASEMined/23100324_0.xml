<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that ataxin-3 is cleaved by proteolytic enzymes, in particular by calpains and caspases, eventually leading to the formation of aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our study, we examined the ability of calpains to cleave ataxin-3 in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated in cell culture and mouse brain homogenates that cleavage of overexpressed ataxin-3 by calpains and in particular by calpain-2 occur and that polyglutamine expanded ataxin-3 is more sensitive to calpain degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, we investigated the influence of calpains on the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we enhanced calpain activity in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> transgenic mouse model by knocking out the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double-mutant mice demonstrated an aggravated neurological phenotype with an increased number of nuclear aggregates and accelerated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the critical importance of calcium-dependent calpain-type proteases in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> and suggests that the manipulation of the ataxin-3 cleavage pathway and the regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis may represent novel targets for therapeutic intervention in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>
