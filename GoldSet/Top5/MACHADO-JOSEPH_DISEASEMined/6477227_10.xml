<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a ten-year study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph-Azorean disease</z:e> (MJAD), three distinct syndromes emerged: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> syndrome (11 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-motor neuron-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal syndrome</z:hpo> (four), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-motor neuron-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal syndrome</z:hpo> (two) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three patients had such advanced disease that classification was not possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These syndromes more accurately describe functional deficits than did previous classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spread of <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> from the cerebellar system to the motor neurons of the spinal cord and brain stem was found for the first time, to my knowledge, in five patients and to the motor neurons and the extrapyramidal system in two of 14 patients followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> is a late complication common to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>World presence of MJAD could have begun with Portuguese overseas expansion in 1415 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the possibility of multiple spontaneous mutations must be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genetic sameness depends on a specific genetic marker, which is not yet available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For accurate genetic counseling, a nonspecific biologic marker for this disease is sought, and electronystagmography changes may prove helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is particularly important as this illness, like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e>, is usually not manifest until the child-bearing years or after </plain></SENT>
