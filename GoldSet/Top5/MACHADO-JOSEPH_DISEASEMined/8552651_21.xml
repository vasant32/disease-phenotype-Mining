<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Five human diseases are due to an excessive number of CAG repeats in the coding regions of five different genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the repeat regions in four of these genes from nonhuman primates, which are not known to suffer from the diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These primates have CAG repeats at the same sites as in human alleles, and there is similar polymorphism of repeat number, but this number is smaller than in the human genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some of the genes, the segment of poly(CAG) has expanded in nonhuman primates, but the process has advanced further in the human lineage than in other primate lineages, thereby predisposing to diseases of CAG reiteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjacent to stretches of homogeneous present-day codon repeats, previously existing codons of the same kind have undergone nucleotide substitutions with high frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Where these lead to amino acid substitutions, the effect will be to reduce the length of the original homopolymeric stretch in the protein </plain></SENT>
