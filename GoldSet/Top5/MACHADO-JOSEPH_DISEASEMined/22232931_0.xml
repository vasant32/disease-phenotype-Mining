<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Touchdown PCR conditions were tested and different primer sets were evaluated with genomic DNA from blood sample of patients suffering from spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An improved PCR assay was developed with a new set of primers and using the optimized touchdown PCR protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This new assay had been successfully employed in the screening of one identificated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results from the present study document a simple and reliable PCR assay for genetic testing of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strategies used in the present study may find applications in the optimization of PCR assay for triplet expansion with GC rich in the sequence context </plain></SENT>
