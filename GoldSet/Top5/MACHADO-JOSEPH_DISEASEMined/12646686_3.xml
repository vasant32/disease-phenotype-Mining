<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> have been found to be caused by the expansion of a CAG-triplet repeat in the coding region of the respective genes, resulting in lengthening of an otherwise harmless polyglutamine tract in the gene products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To facilitate structural studies of these disease mechanisms, a general protocol is described that allows site-specific mutations to be introduced into the polyglutamine tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on 'cassette mutagenesis', this protocol involves engineering unique restriction sites into the flanking regions of the CAG repeat and subsequently replacing the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> CAG repeat with a double-stranded synthetic DNA fragment containing the desired mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This method was applied to the spinocerebellar ataxin-3 protein, such that the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> amino acid sequence -Q(3)KQ(22)- was replaced by a -Q(9)CQ(9)- sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this case, the incorporated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residue</z:chebi> can be exploited for various chemical modifications, lending the host glutamine repeat to many structural and biophysical techniques for the resolution of a specific residue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method reported here bypasses many problems that can arise from PCR-based mutagenesis methods </plain></SENT>
