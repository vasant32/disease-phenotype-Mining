<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to assess the neurological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, and to describe and test the feasibility, reliability, and validity of a comprehensive Neurological Examination Score for Spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> (NESSCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NESSCA was administered to molecularly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients at an outpatient neurogenetics clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The scale, based on the standardized neurological examination, consisted of 18 items that yielded a total score ranging from 0 to 40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The score's interrater reliability and internal consistency were investigated, and a principal components analysis and a correlation with external measures were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-nine individuals were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interrater reliability ranged from 0.8 to 1 across individual items (P &lt; 0.001); internal consistency, indicated by Cronbach's alpha, was 0.77 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NESSCA scores were significantly correlated with measures of disease severity: disease stage (rho = 0.76, P &lt; 0.001), duration (rho = 0.56, P &lt; 0.001), and length of CAG repeat (rho = 0.30, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NESSCA was a reliable measure for the assessment of distinct neurological deficits in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Global scores correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> external variables tested, showing NESSCA to be a comprehensive measure of disease severity that is both clinically useful and scientifically valid </plain></SENT>
