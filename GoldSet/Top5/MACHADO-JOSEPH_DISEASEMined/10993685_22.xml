<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene responsible for the disease, a novel gene of unknown function, encodes ataxin-3 containing a polyglutamine stretch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although it has been known that ataxin-3 is incorporated into <z:mp ids='MP_0004191'>neuronal intranuclear inclusions</z:mp> (NIIs) in neurons of affected regions, the relationship between NII formation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> still remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study we show two different conditions in which ataxin-3 is recruited into the nucleus and suggest a process to form nuclear inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brains, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> ataxin-3 localizes within the ubiquitin-positive nuclear inclusion, the Marinesco body, indicating that ataxin-3 is recruited into the nuclear inclusion even in the absence of pathologically expanded polyglutamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> brains, immunohistochemical analyses with anti-ataxin-3 antibody, anti-ubiquitin antibody, and monoclonal antibody 1C2 known to recognize expanded polyglutamine revealed differences in frequency and in diameter among NIIs recognized by each antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed in the same inclusions by double immunofluorescent staining, suggesting that expanded ataxin-3 forms a core, thereby recruiting <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> ataxin-3 into the nucleus around the core portion, and then followed by activation of the ubiquitin/ATP-dependent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recruitment of ataxin-3 into the nucleus and formation of nuclear inclusion under two different conditions suggest that ataxin-3 may be translocated into the nucleus under certain conditions stressful on neuronal cells such as aging and polyglutamine neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
