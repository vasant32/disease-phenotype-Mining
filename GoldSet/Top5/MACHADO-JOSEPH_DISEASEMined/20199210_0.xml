<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only the patients who carry an allele with expansion in the ataxin-3 gene presented with clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This interesting family presents a unique mutation state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We will continue to track this family in the future, which may help us further elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (SCA) type 3 and 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study also provides us a novel conception that mutations from two pathogenetic genes may coexist in one patient and SCA-affected patients with intermediate allele need to be further excluded for other SCA subtypes </plain></SENT>
