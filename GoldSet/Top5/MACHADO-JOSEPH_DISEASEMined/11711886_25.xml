<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we hypothesized that amino acid sequences flanking the polyglutamine stretches influence the aggregate formation potential of these stretches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins containing glutamine repeats of various lengths and a fixed number of flanking amino acids of ataxin-2, huntingtin, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> protein (DRPLAP) or ataxin-3 were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aggregate formation potential of ataxin-2 and DRPLAP increased in a CAG-repeat-length-dependent manner, with a threshold between 34 and 36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Truncated ataxin-2-Q56-GFP and truncated huntingtin-Q56-GFP showed a significantly higher aggregate formation potential than truncated DRPLAP-Q56-GFP or truncated ataxin-3-Q56-GFP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results are in agreement with the clinical observation that ages of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in patients with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 2 or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> are lower than those in patients with DRPLA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> having expanded CAG repeats of the same length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mutagenesis of the flanking sequence of ataxin-2 markedly reduced its aggregate formation potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the amino acid sequences flanking the polyglutamine stretches significantly influence their aggregate formation potential </plain></SENT>
