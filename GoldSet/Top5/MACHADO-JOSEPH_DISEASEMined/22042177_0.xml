<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Sixteen patients were studied and the following procedures were carried out: anamnesis, otorhinolaryngological and vestibular evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical findings in the entire group of patients were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbances</z:hpo> (93.75%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> (43.75%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (43.75%), dizziness (37.50%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (37.50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the vestibular exam, the rotatory (62.50%) and caloric (75%) tests were among those which presented the largest indexes of abnormalities; the presence of alterations in the exams was 87.50%, with a predominance of central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042594" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vestibular disorders</z:e> in 68.75% of the exams </plain></SENT>
