<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new screening method was developed for the detection of CAG expanded alleles in patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> using polymerase chain reaction-based microtiter plate hybridization (PCR-MPH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The system can be applied to detect pathologic alleles by hybridization with the immobilized (CAG)48 repeat probe derived from the unrelated gene 'ERDA1' except for the CAG repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined 10 individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, 10 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington disease</z:e> and 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (31 controls for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) using this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that a clear discrimination was possible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this system be made available for mass screening of patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This report is the first to demonstrate that a PCR-MPH system can be successfully applied to DNA size differentiation in addition to base pair mismatches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, our design of the probe is unique in that the probe motif stem from the unrelated gene sequence and not from the synthetic oligonucleotides </plain></SENT>
