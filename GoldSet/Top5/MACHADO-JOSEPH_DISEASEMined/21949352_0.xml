<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is caused by an expansion of a CAG-trinucelotide repeat region within the coding sequence of the ATXN3 gene, and this results in an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract within the Ataxin-3 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The polyQ expansion leads to neuronal dysfunction and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we tested the ability of a number of proteins that interact with Ataxin-3 to modulate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> pathogenicity using Drosophila </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 10 candidates, we found four novel enhancers and one suppressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The suppressor, PICK1 (Protein interacting with C kinase 1), is a transport protein that regulates the trafficking of ion channel subunits involved in calcium homeostasis to and from the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In line with calcium homeostasis being a potential pathway <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, we also found that down-regulation of Nach, an acid sensing ion channel, mitigates <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> pathogenesis in flies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Modulation of PICK1 could be targeted in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, as the toxicity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> and tau was also suppressed when PICK1 was down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that interaction proteins may define a rich source of modifier pathways to target in disease situations </plain></SENT>
