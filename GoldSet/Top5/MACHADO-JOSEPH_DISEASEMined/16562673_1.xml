<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: First we sub-cloned the full reading frame of both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant ataxin-3 into carrier pGBKT7 (ataxin-3-bait), and then screened human brain cDNA library with ataxin-3-bait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found five positive clones in 6.5 x 10(6) transformers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After sequencing, we knew <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them were novel ataxin-3 interacting proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three were corresponded to the known sequences coding the known proteins, which were human Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor alpha, small ubiquitin-like modifier 1, and human neuronal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2639">amiloride</z:chebi>-sensitive <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> channel 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another two of the five were unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 probably interacted with ataxin-3, suggesting that the sumoylation probably participated in post-translation modifying of ataxin-3 and pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
