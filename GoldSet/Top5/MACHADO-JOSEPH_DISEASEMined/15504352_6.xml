<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene on long arm of chromosome 14 has been identified as the pathologic mutation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was previously shown to be responsible for the neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we utilized human neuronal SK-N-SH cells stably transfected with HA-tagged full-length <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> with 78 polyglutamine repeats to examine the effects of polyglutamine expansion on neuronal cell survival in the early stage of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various pro-apoptotic agents were used to assess the tolerance of the mutant cells and to compare the differences between cells with and without mutant ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concentration- and time-dependent experiments showed that the increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was more pronounced and accelerated in cells containing expanded ataxin-3 via MTS assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, under basal conditions, Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses showed a significant decrease of Bcl-2 protein expression and an increase of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> in cells containing expanded ataxin-3 when compared with those of the parental cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same reduction of Bcl-2 was further confirmed in fibroblast cells with mutant ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, exogenous expression of Bcl-2 desensitized SK-N-SH-MJD78 cells to poly-Q toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo>-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> plays a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our cellular model, full-length expanded ataxin-3 that leads to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> significantly impaired the expression of Bcl-2 protein, which may be, at least in part, responsible for the weak tolerance to polyglutamine toxicity at the early stage of disease and ultimately resulted in an increase of stress-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> upon apoptotic stress </plain></SENT>
