<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, involvement of autophagy-specific proteins (NBR1 and LC3) in NIIs has not been mentioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We immunohistochemically examined the brain of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>; n=5), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (DRPLA; n=5) and intranuclear inclusion body disease (INIBD; n=5), using antibodies against ubiquitin, p62, NBR1 and LC3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of p62-, NBR1- and LC3-positive inclusions relative to the number of ubiquitin-positive inclusions was calculated in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NIIs were positive for p62 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> (19.3%), DRPLA (49.7%) and INIBD (99.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As for autophagy-specific proteins, NIIs were positive for NBR1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> (4.2%), DRPLA (5.5%) and INIBD (13.2%) and negative for LC3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, DRPLA and INIBD, except for one case of INIBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that autophagy-lysosome pathway is not involved in the formation/degradation of NIIs </plain></SENT>
