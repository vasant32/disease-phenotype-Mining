<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3 (AT3), a protein that causes spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3, has a C-terminus containing a polyglutamine stretch, the length of which can be expanded in its pathological variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29036">Cu(2+)</z:chebi>, Mn(2+), Zn(2+) and Al(3+) in the induction of defective protein structures and subsequent aggregation/fibrillogenesis of three different non-pathological forms of AT3, i.e. murine (Q6), human non-expanded (Q26) and human moderately expanded (Q36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AT3 variants showed an intrinsic propensity to misfolding/aggregation; on the other hand, Zn(2+) and Al(3+) strongly stimulated the amplitude and kinetics of these conformational conversions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While both metal ions induced a time-dependent aggregation into amyloid-like fibrillar forms, only small oligomers and/or short protofibrillar species were detected for AT3s alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate and extent of the metal-induced aggregation/fibrillogenesis processes increased with the size of the polyglutamine stretch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mn(2+) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29036">Cu(2+)</z:chebi> had no effect on (Q6) or actually prevented (Q26 and Q36) the AT3 structural transitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observation that Zn(2+) and Al(3+) promote AT3 fibrillogenesis is consistent with similar results found for other amyloidogenic molecules, such as beta-amyloid and prion proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plausibly, these metal ions are a major common factor/cofactor in the etiopathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Studies of liposomes as membrane models showed dramatic changes in the structural properties of the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> bilayer in the presence of AT3, which were enhanced after supplementing the protein with Zn(2+) and Al(3+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that cell membranes could be a potential primary target in the ataxin-3 pathogenesis and metals could be a biological factor capable of modulating their interaction with AT3 </plain></SENT>
