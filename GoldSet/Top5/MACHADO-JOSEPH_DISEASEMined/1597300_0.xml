<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Four pedigrees of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Main clinical features of 21 patients in these pedigrees were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo>, limb <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo>, gaze <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo>, facio-lingual <z:mp ids='MP_0005424'>twitchings</z:mp>, and external <z:hpo ids='HP_0000597'>ophthalmoparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>Amyotrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002375'>hypokinesia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> were manifested with advance of the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with younger <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age, such <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal signs</z:hpo> were dominated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological study of one autopsied case disclosed that there were degeneration of spinocerebellar tract, anterior horn cells, pontine nuclei, dentate nucleus, red nucleus, substantia nigra, internal segment of globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and motor nuclei of brain stem; neurons of cerebellar cortex and inferior olivary nucleus were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From these clinical and pathological features, these 4 pedigrees satisfied the criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, and were differentiated from hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002542'>olivopontocerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Currently, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> is accepted as a new entity of hereditary spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there are still controversies as to whether Azores-Portuguese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> are identical disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the nosological relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and a number of similar cases, as reported historically under the diagnosis of Brown type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> or Marie's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, has not been clearly established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From reviewing such cases critically, pathological and clinical features of our cases are so similar to those of the latter, indicating that the probably identical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> has been classified under the different categories </plain></SENT>
