<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As part of the multicentre European integrated project on spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo> study, 37 patients with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-1, 19 with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-3 and seven with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-6 were clinically examined and underwent magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and after a 2-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were compared with age-matched and gender-matched healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging analysis included three-dimensional volumetry and observer-independent longitudinal voxel-based morphometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Volumetry revealed loss of brainstem, cerebellar and basal ganglia volume in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most sensitive to change was the pontine volume in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-1, striatal volume in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-3 and caudate volume in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity to change, as measured by standard response mean, of the respective MRI measures was greater than that of the most sensitive clinical measure, the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal voxel-based morphometry revealed greatest grey matter loss in the cerebellum and brainstem in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-1, in the putamen and pallidum in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-3 and in the cerebellum, thalamus, putamen and pallidum in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a mild correlation between CAG repeat length and volume loss of the bilateral cerebellum and the pons in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Quantitative volumetry and voxel-based morphometry imaging demonstrated genotype-specific patterns of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> progression in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo>-1, 3 and 6, and they showed a high sensitivity to detect change that was superior to clinical scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These structural magnetic resonance imaging findings have the potential to serve as surrogate markers, which might help to delineate quantifiable endpoints and non-invasive methods for rapid and reliable data acquisition, encouraging their use in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
