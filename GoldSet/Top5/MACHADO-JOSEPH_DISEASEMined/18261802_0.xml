<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Likewise, standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis techniques are applied for screening large number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The trinucleotide repeats (TNR) region amplification by means of the PCR procedure was initially performed using 32-P end-labelled primers and currently carried out with fluorescently end-labelled primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal to obtain reliable TNR quantification assays, at low cost and short assay times, represents a challenge for the molecular diagnosis aimed at massive screening of affected populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the current work, we obtained preliminary results of a new methodology for the detection and size estimation of CAG expanded alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The assay was based on an indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for quantifying the amount of labelled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidines</z:chebi> in DNA molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The label, 6-(p-bromobenzamido)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23574">caproyl</z:chebi> radical, was introduced by the transamination and acylation reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A group of model sequences containing different numbers of CAG repeats, as well as the ATXN3 (ataxin 3) gene (from subjects suffering type 3 spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) were used for assay standardization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The assay is simple, inexpensive, and easy to perform and differentiates distinct degrees of CAG expansions </plain></SENT>
