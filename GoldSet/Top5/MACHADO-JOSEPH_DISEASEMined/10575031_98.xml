<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate the role in polygln disease of heat shock proteins (Hsps), the major class of molecular chaperones responsible for modulating protein folding in the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In transfected COS7 and PC12 neural cells, we show that Hsp40 and Hsp70 chaperones localize to intranuclear aggregates formed by either mutant ataxin-3, the disease protein in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>), or an unrelated green fluorescent protein fusion protein containing expanded polygln </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrate that expression of expanded polygln protein elicits a stress response in cells as manifested by marked induction of Hsp70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> disease brain confirm these findings, showing localization of Hsp40 and, less commonly, Hsp70 chaperones to intranuclear ataxin-3 aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In transfected cells, overexpression of either of two Hsp40 chaperones, the DNAJ protein homologs HDJ-1 and HDJ-2, suppresses aggregation of truncated or full-length mutant ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we extend these studies to a PC12 neural model of polygln toxicity in which we demonstrate that overexpression of HDJ-1 suppresses polygln aggregation with a parallel decrease in toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that expanded polygln protein induces a stress response and that specific molecular chaperones may aid the handling of misfolded or aggregated polygln protein in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study has therapeutic implications because it suggests that efforts to increase chaperone activity may prove beneficial in this class of diseases </plain></SENT>
