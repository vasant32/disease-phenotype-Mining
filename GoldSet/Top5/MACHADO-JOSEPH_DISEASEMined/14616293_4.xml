<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explain the low prevalence of the disease among SCA patients from eastern India, we analysed CAG repeats and two bi-allelic intragenic markers at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> locus among 412 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: For CAG repeat analysis, PCR amplified fragments were run on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel, transferred to a membrane, probed with (CAG)10 and detected on an autoradiograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bi-allelic markers were analysed using allele specific PCR amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles (&gt;33 CAG repeats) were 0.015 in pooled populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had the common haplotype C-A as observed worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequency of C-A haplotype among large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles was 0.75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Observed low prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> could be because of the low prevalence of large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles that might act as the reservoir for the expanded alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> mutation in Indian populations had the same origin as found worldwide </plain></SENT>
