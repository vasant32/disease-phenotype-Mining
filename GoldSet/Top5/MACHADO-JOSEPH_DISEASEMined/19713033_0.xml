<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient noted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> at 14 years of age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002317'>unsteady gait</z:hpo> at 30 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar sized expansions of the CAG trinucleotide repeats in one allele of the ataxin-3 (ATXN3) gene were found in both the patient and his father, although in the other allele the length of the CAG repeats was shorter in the father compared with the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027126" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dystrophia myotonica</z:e> protein kinase (DMPK) gene the CTG repeats were much more expanded in the patient compared with his father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus it is possible that, in the farther, the short CAG repeat in the non-expanded ATXN3 allele delayed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cerebellar symptoms, and/or that the expanded CTG repeat in the DMPK gene in the patient accelerated the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>
