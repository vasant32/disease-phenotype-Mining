<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The structured N-terminal Josephin domain (JD) of AT3 is conserved within a novel family of potential ubiquitin proteases, the JD-containing proteins, which are sub-divided into two groups termed ataxins and Josephins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These AT3 orthologs are encoded by the genomes of organisms ranging from Plasmodium falciparum to humans, with most species possessing more than one homolog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While Josephins consist of JDs alone, ataxins contain additional functional domains that may influence their enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that the enzyme activity of human AT3 (hAT3) is not affected by the length of polyQ in its C-terminus, even when it is in the range associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also show that JDs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human proteins with homology to AT3 and its homologs from various species possess de-ubiquitination activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results establish JD-containing proteins as a novel family of active de-ubiquitination enzymes with wide phylogenic distribution </plain></SENT>
