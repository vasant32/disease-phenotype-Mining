<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the correlation between brainstem and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> and the clinical features has not been well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the correlation between MRI features of the brainstem and cerebellum and predominant clinical features in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: University teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: By using the linear measurement method, we assessed 32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> to study the correlations between the morphometric data of the brainstem and cerebellum and clinical features: Duration of the disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, total international cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> rating scale (ICARS) score; total scale for the assessment and rating of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (SARA) score; ICARS subscores, and SARA subscores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Pearson correlation test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant inverse correlation between anteroposterior diameter of the midbrain and pons and total ICARS scores, total SARA scores, ICARS and SARA subscores (r = -0.381 approximately -0.57, P &lt; 0.05 or 0.01) and disease duration (r = -0.42 approximately -0.51, P &lt; 0.05 or 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, superoinferior diameter of the cerebellum was inversely correlated with total SARA scores and ICARS and SARA subscores except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> of posture and gait in both scales (r = - 0.37 approximately -0.44, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The superoinferior diameter of the fourth ventricle was inversely correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> (r = -0.45, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The effect on the cerebellum and brainstem is related to predominant clinical features in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
