<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We obtained brain MRI and single-voxel proton <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy (MRS) over the superior-posterior region of the left hemisphere at the level of the corpus callosum in 40 patients (44.6 +/- 2.3 years-old) and 27 controls (31.4 +/- 3.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients were excluded due to poor quality spectra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed a decrease in signal intensity of N-acetylaspartate relative to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>-phosphocreatine signal (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> compared to control [1.63 +/- 0.41 (1.15-2.76) versus 1.97 +/- .51 (1.50-2.92); U test = 219.0; P &lt; .001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No statistical difference was observed in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>-containing compounds relative to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (Cho/Cr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr and clinical and genetic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Due to the younger age of the control group, we performed a secondary analysis in a subgroup of 15 MJD patients matched by age to 15 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Matching was performed blindly to MRS results and subject identification, except for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant difference was observed in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratios (U test = 44.0; P= .004), as well as Cho/Cr levels (U test = 53.0; P= .014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> observed in the deep white matter in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> suggest extensive neuronal and axonal dysfunction in these patients </plain></SENT>
