<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the mutation causing the disease has been identified as an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study relations between genotype and phenotype were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A series of 180 German patients with degenerative forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> were clinically and genetically examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients bearing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> mutation were assigned to three phenotypes: phenotype 1 characterised by early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> or pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main symptoms in phenotype 2 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In phenotype 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was relatively late and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> accompanied <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical and molecular data were correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An expanded CAG array was found in 42 patients from 22 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Repeat length of CAG varied between 67 and 80 CAG motifs and showed an inverse correlation with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the development of phenotype 1 early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (&lt; 20 years) seemed more decisive than extensive repeat length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Phenotype 2 was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with more than 73 CAG motifs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> between 20 and 40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Phenotype 3 developed in most patients with less than 73 CAG motifs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was regularly beyond the age of 40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Intrafamilial variability of both repeat length and phenotype was large reflecting meiotic instability of the expanded CAG repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> mutation is the most frequent cause of dominantly inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Variations in repeat lengths substantially influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> as well as phenotype but cannot explain why <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> characteristics of Portuguese families such as "<z:mp ids='MP_0002750'>bulging eyes</z:mp>", <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> are essentially missing in German families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Despite the genotypic and phenotypic relations found in this study a reliable individual prognosis of the course of the disease is not possible at a presymptomatic stage </plain></SENT>
