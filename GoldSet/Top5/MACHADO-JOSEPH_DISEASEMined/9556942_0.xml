<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The molecular abnormality responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>), a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorder</z:e>, has recently been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has also been previously documented using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">[18F]</z:chebi>-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4167">D-glucose</z:chebi> (FDG) to record the metabolic changes in the brains of symptomatic subjects affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated these changes in asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene carriers, previously identified by molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PET with FDG was used to study <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in the brains of three asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene carriers who were identified by molecular analysis, and in 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By comparison with data obtained from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects, significantly decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization was found in the cerebellar hemisphere and occipital cortex of these three asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene carriers, suggesting preclinical disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of diagnosis based on PET examination alone was 100% in this study, using significant decrease in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in the cerebellar hemisphere as a criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of regional brain metabolism by PET is noninvasive, and subclinical reduction of FDG consumption in the cerebellar hemisphere and occipital cortex is found to act as an objective marker of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the results from a limited number of patients, the sensitivity of PET is sufficient to justify its routine use in the investigation of asymptomatic at-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> subjects </plain></SENT>
