<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main goal of this study was to investigate the presence of segregation ratio distortion (SRD) during transmissions of ATXN3 alleles by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients, evaluating the putative role of SRD in the epidemiological representation of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two complete sibships, each with one clinically affected parent, totalling 330 transmissions were selected according to defined criteria and used for segregation analysis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Residual risk values were applied to unaffected offspring to calculate the probability of inheriting the expanded allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of offspring that received the expanded or the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele from the affected parent was calculated to determine the presence of SRD during transmissions of ATXN3 alleles by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Segregation of ATXN3 alleles was in accordance with the expected Mendelian proportions (chi (2) = 0.982, P = 0.322) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was a tendency favouring the transmission of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, SRD is not a potential mechanism on the basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> epidemiological representation </plain></SENT>
