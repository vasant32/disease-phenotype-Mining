<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (SCA) type 7 is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disorder characterized by neural loss, mainly in the cerebellum and regions of the brainstem and particularly the inferior olivary complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> disease is associated with expansion of unstable CAG repeats within the 5'-translated region of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e> gene, located on chromosome 3p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a local survey of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population and candidate patients for the analysis of the CAG repeats in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distributions of the CAG repeat units of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e> gene in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population in Taiwan were established in this study by using the radioactive genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of CAG repeats is from 6 to 17 repeats, with the more common being around 8-13 repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The range is narrower than that reported for other ethnic groups (7-35 CAGs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, by the use of a combination of PCR and Southern blot analysis, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e> family was identified and is reported here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A marked instability of the CAG repeat number during transmission from father to son (41 vs. 100) was observed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e> family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical anticipation is significant in this family including an infantile case, who was found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> from the age of 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To date, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e> mutation has been detected in one of 73 families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> phenotypes, which is about 1.4% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> families referred to us, compared to 1.4% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>, 9.6% SCA2, and 27.3% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> in our collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, we demonstrate that the PCR-based Southern blot analysis, with the advantages of sensitivity of PCR and specificity of Southern blot, is a reliable diagnostic method for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e> mutation screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The molecular analysis technique makes possible the quick and accurate diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e> patients and in the future will hopefully be applied to prenatal screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e> families </plain></SENT>
