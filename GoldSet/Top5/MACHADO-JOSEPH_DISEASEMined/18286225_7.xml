<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The putative segregation ratio distortion (SRD) of alleles can play an important role in the non-Mendelian behaviour of triplet repeat loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the stability and infer the segregation patterns of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> alleles, the size of the (CAG)(n) tract was analysed in 102 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sibships, representing 428 meioses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No mutational events were detected during the transmission of alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Segregation analysis showed that the smaller alleles were preferentially transmitted (56.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considering maternal meioses alone, such preference was still detected (55.7%) but without statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was observed for the difference in length between the two alleles constituting the transmitters' genotype (D) and the frequency of transmission of the smaller alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that small D values are not enough to modify the probability of allele transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When transmissions involving genotypes with D &lt;or= 2 were excluded, SRD in favour of the smaller allele became significant for both maternal and paternal transmissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the genotypic composition of the transmitters in a sample to be analysed should influence the ability to detect SRD, acting as a confounding factor </plain></SENT>
