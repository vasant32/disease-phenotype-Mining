<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence that generation of truncated proteins containing an expanded polyglutamine tract may be a key step in the pathogenesis of these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now report that, similar to huntingtin, atrophin-1, ataxin-3, and the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor are cleaved in apoptotic extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, each of these proteins is cleaved by one or more purified caspases, cysteine proteases involved in apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CAG length does not modulate susceptibility to cleavage of any of the full-length proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that by generation of truncated polyglutamine-containing proteins, caspase cleavage may represent a common step in the pathogenesis of each of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
