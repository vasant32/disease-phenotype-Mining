<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In mammalian cell models we demonstrate that allele-specific silencing of disease genes with siRNA can be achieved by targeting either a linked single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or the disease mutation directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For a polyglutamine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorder</z:e> in which we first determined that selective targeting of the disease-causing CAG repeat is not possible, we took advantage of an associated SNP to generate siRNA that exclusively silenced the mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>/spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 allele while sparing expression of the WT allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allele-specific suppression was accomplished with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three approaches currently used to deliver siRNA: in vitro-synthesized duplexes as well as plasmid and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> expression of short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further optimized siRNA to specifically target a missense Tau mutation, V337M, that causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These studies establish that siRNA can be engineered to silence disease genes differing by a single nucleotide and highlight a key role for SNPs in extending the utility of siRNA in dominantly inherited disorders </plain></SENT>
