<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation of age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> with the length of the expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats has been demonstrated, and the intergenerational instability of the length of the CAG trinucleotide repeats, which is more prominent in paternal than in maternal transmissions, has been shown to underlie the basic mechanisms of anticipation in DRPLA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our previous observations on DRPLA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> pedigrees, as well as a review of the literature, have suggested that the numbers of affected offspring exceed those of unaffected offspring, which is difficult to explain by the Mendelian principle of random segregation of alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed the segregation patterns in 211 transmissions in 24 DRPLA pedigrees and 80 transmissions in 7 MJD pedigrees, with the diagnoses confirmed by molecular testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant distortions in favor of transmission of the mutant alleles were found in male meiosis, where the mutant alleles were transmitted to 62% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> offspring in DRPLA (chi2 = 7.69; P&lt;.01) and 73% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> (chi2 = 6.82; P&lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were consistent with <z:mp ids='MP_0010032'>meiotic drive</z:mp> in DRPLA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since more prominent meiotic instability of the length of the CAG trinucleotide repeats is observed in male meiosis than in female meiosis and <z:mp ids='MP_0010032'>meiotic drive</z:mp> is observed only in male meiosis, these results raise the possibility that a common molecular mechanism underlies the <z:mp ids='MP_0010032'>meiotic drive</z:mp> and the meiotic instability in male meiosis </plain></SENT>
