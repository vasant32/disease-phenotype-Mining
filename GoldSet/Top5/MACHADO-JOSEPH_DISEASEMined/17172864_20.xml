<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recently isolated the miRNA bantam (ban) in a genetic screen for modulators of pathogenicity of a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> model in Drosophila </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies showed that upregulation of ban mitigates degeneration induced by the pathogenic polyglutamine (polyQ) protein Ataxin-3, which is mutated in the human polyglutamine disease spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To address the broader role for miRNAs in neuroprotection, we also showed that loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> miRNAs, by dicer mutation, dramatically enhances pathogenic polyQ protein toxicity in flies and in human HeLa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that miRNAs may be important for neuronal survival in the context of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies provide the foundation to define the miRNAs involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo>, and the biological pathways affected </plain></SENT>
