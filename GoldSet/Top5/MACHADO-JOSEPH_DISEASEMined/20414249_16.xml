<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, mutations in p97 cause the disorder inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029401" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Paget disease of bone</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (IBMPFD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis underlying impaired degradation and pathological aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins in IBMPFD is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we identify perturbed co-factor binding as a common defect of IBMPFD-causing mutant p97 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that IBMPFD mutations induce conformational changes in the p97 N domain, the main binding site for regulatory co-factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistently, mutant p97 proteins exhibit strongly altered co-factor interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, binding of the ubiquitin ligase E4B is reduced, whereas binding of ataxin 3 is enhanced, thus resembling the accumulation of mutant ataxin 3 on p97 in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that imbalanced co-factor binding to p97 is a key pathological feature of IBMPFD and potentially of other proteinopathies involving p97 </plain></SENT>
