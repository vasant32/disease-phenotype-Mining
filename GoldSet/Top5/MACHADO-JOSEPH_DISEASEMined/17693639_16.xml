<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the cellular regulation of ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is an important issue, since growing evidence links disease protein context to pathogenesis in polyglutamine disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expanded ataxin-3, for example, is more neurotoxic in fruit fly models when its active site cysteine is mutated (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore sought to determine the influence of ataxin-3 enzymatic activity on various cellular properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we present evidence that the catalytic activity of ataxin-3 regulates its cellular turnover, ubiquitination, and subcellular distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cellular protein levels of catalytically inactive ataxin-3 were much higher than those of active ataxin-3, in part reflecting slower degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies revealed that inactive ataxin-3 was more slowly degraded by the proteasome and that this degradation occurred independent of ubiquitination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Slower degradation of inactive ataxin-3 correlated with reduced interaction with the proteasome shuttle protein, VCP/p97 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Enzymatically active ataxin-3 also showed a greater tendency to concentrate in the nucleus, where it colocalized with the proteasome in subnuclear foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these and other findings suggest that the catalytic activity of this disease-linked deubiquitinating enzyme regulates several of its cellular properties, which in turn may influence disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
