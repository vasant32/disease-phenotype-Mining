<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Occupational therapy (OT) is a profession concerned with promoting health and well-being through occupation, by enabling handicapped people to participate in the activities of everyday life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OT is part of the clinical rehabilitation of progressive genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> such as spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo>; however, its effects have never been determined in these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the effect of OT on both physical disabilities and depressive symptoms of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomically diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients older than 18 years were invited to participate in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disability, as evaluated by functional independence measurement and Barthel incapacitation score, Hamilton Rating Scale for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo>, and World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), was determined at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients agreed to participate in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were treated because OT prevents blinding of a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen sessions of rehabilitative OT were applied over a period of 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Difficult access to food, clothing, personal hygiene, and leisure were some of the main disabilities focused by these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After this treatment, disability scores and quality of life were stable, and the Hamilton scores for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since no medication was started up to 6 months before or during OT, this improvement was related to our intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No association was found between these endpoints and a CAG tract of the MJD1 gene (CAGn), age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, or neurological scores at baseline (Spearman test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the possibly temporary stabilization of the downhill disabilities as an effect of OT remains to be established, its clear effect on depressive symptoms confirms the recommendation of OT to any patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> or spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
