<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Presented here are 5 MJD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A morphometric analysis of the histopathology of their sural nerves was carried out to know the relationship between axon size and myelin thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> cases were identified by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the clinical symptoms, there was 1 type I, 2 type II and 2 type III patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sural nerves were biopsied for single-fiber, ultrastructural and morphometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morphometric parameters such as fiber and axon sizes, myelin thickness and g ratio (axon diameter:fiber diameter) were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathological features of the sural nerves in the 2 type III and 1 of the type II patients revealed a loss of myelinated and unmyelinated fibers, and the morphometry studies showed a decreased fiber density, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003387'>loss of large myelinated fibers</z:hpo>, a smaller size of the axons with thinner myelin sheaths and an increased percentage of myelinated fibers with a g ratio (axon diameter:fiber diameter) above 0.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, only subtle pathological changes were noted in the type I patient and the remaining type II patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggested that there is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003387'>loss of large myelinated fibers</z:hpo> and distal axonopathy with relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003429'>hypomyelination</z:hpo> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
