<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although there is growing evidence that aging has an important role in the occurrence of such diseases, the role of aging in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> of these diseases is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies showed that differences in amyloid conformation from different brain regions lead to differing toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that higher amyloid toxicity at later ages might cause the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> of polyglutamine diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a method for temporal and regional gene expression targeting (TARGET) in Drosophila, we showed that transient polyglutamine expression caused more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in older flies than in younger flies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the polyglutamine amyloids themselves showed distinct characteristics in relation to age; those from older flies were less resistant to <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> and more effective at seeding polymerization than those from younger flies, suggesting that the polyglutamine amyloids in aged individuals may have higher toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings show that age-related changes in amyloid characteristics may be a trigger for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> polyglutamine diseases </plain></SENT>
