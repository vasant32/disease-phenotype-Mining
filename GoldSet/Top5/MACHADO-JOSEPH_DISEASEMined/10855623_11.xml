<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients (8 women, 2 men; age range, 20-71 y; mean age +/- SD, 36.4 +/- 10.6 y; mean duration of illness, 9.8 +/- 5.4 y) and 21 healthy volunteers (age range, 24-71 y; mean age, 47.6 +/- 20.1 y) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain SPECT images were acquired 4 h after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ratio of specific to nonspecific nigrostriatal 99mTc-TRODAT-1 binding was measured and compared with the clinical symptoms, duration of illness, and size of abnormal expanded CAG repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> nigrostriatal 99mTc-TRODAT-1 ratios were significantly lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients than in healthy volunteers (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight of 10 MJD patients had significantly decreased 99mTc-TRODAT-1 uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these 8, 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal signs</z:hpo> and 6 had no obvious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal signs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other 2 patients, who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 99mTc-TRODAT-1 uptake, had no obvious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal signs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that 99mTc-TRODAT-1 brain SPECT is an appropriate method for evaluating damage to the nigrostriatal DAT in symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal signs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decreased binding of 99mTc-TRODAT-1 in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients correlates with the phenotype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal signs</z:hpo> but not with the abnormal CAG repeat length, age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, or disease duration </plain></SENT>
