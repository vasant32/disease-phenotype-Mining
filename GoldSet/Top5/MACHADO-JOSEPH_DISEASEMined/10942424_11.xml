<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of intranuclear inclusions (INIs) in patients and cellular models of exp-CAG-associated diseases has lead to a nuclear toxicity model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar INIs are found in oculopharyngeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, which is caused by a short expansion of an alanine-encoding GCG repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we propose that transcriptional or translational frameshifts occurring within expanded CAG tracts result in the production and accumulation of polyalanine-containing mutant proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that these alanine polymers deposit in cells forming INIs and may contribute to nuclear toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show evidence that supports our hypothesis in lymphoblast cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients, as well as in pontine neurons of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> brain and in in vitro cell culture models of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also provide evidence that alanine polymers alone are harmful to cells and predict that a similar pathogenic mechanism may occur in the other CAG repeat disorders </plain></SENT>
