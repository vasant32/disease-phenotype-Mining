<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One established property of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32677">glutamine residue</z:chebi>, depending on the nature of the flanking residues, is its ability to act as an <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> acceptor in a transglutaminase-catalyzed reaction and to make a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32483">glutamyl</z:chebi>-lysine cross-link with a neighboring <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To learn whether glutamine repeats can act as <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> acceptors, we have made <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> with variable lengths of polyglutamine flanked by the adjacent amino acid residues in the proteins associated with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>), or dentato-rubral pallidoluysian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (DRPLA) or those residues adjacent to the preferred cross-linking site of involucrin, or solely by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residues</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The polyglutamine was found to confer excellent substrate properties on any soluble <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>; under optimal conditions, virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32677">glutamine residues</z:chebi> acted as <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> acceptors in the reaction with glycine ethyl-<z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi>, and lengthening the sequence of polyglutamine increased the reactivity of each <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32677">glutamine residue</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the presence of transglutaminase, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> containing polyglutamine formed insoluble aggregates with the proteins of brain extracts and these aggregates contained <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32483">glutamyl</z:chebi>-lysine cross-links </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repeated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32677">glutamine residues</z:chebi> exposed on the surface of a neuronal protein should form cross-linked aggregates in the presence of any transglutaminase activated by the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
