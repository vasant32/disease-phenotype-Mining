<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined 138 cases of a disorder previously described in people of Portuguese origin and which has received many names </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By computer analysis of 46 different items of a standardized neurological examination carried out in each patient, we have been able to delineate the main components of the clinical presentation, to conclude that the marked variability in clinical expressions does not negate the homogeneity of the disorder, and to describe the natural history of this entity which should be called, for historical reasons, "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph Disease</z:e>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary disease</z:e> has an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>, presenting as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002073'>progressive ataxia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000544'>external ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo>, and should be classified within the group of "Ataxic multisystem degenerations" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the disease starts before the age of 20, it may present with marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo>, of a non progressive nature but often so severe that it can be accompanied by "Gegenhalten" countermovements and dystonic postures but little frank <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There are few true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal symptoms</z:hpo> except <z:hpo ids='HP_0002304'>akinesia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the disease starts after the age of 50, the clinical spectrum is mostly that of an amyotrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002380'>fasciculations</z:hpo> accompanying the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other cases the clinical picture is a continuum between these two extremes, the main determinant of the clinical phenotype being the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and a secondary factor, the place of origin of the given kindred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ataxic and amyotrophic components are clearly progressive with time in contrast to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the majority of known cases are of Portuguese origin, this is not obligatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The next research endeavour should be a search for the chromosomal site of the gene, using molecular biology technology such as those for recombinant DNA </plain></SENT>
