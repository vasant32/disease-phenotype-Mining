<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on the symptoms of RLS were collected by a standardized questionnaire, and RLS was diagnosed when patients met the four minimal criteria of the syndrome as recently defined by an international study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we studied the relationship between RLS and age, age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, CAG repeat length, and nerve conduction and evoked potentials data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RLS was significantly more frequent in SCA patients than in controls (28% vs. 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age at RLS <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in SCA was 49.0 +/- 10.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in nerve conduction or evoked potentials between RLS and non-RLS SCA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probability of developing RLS increased with age but not with CAG repeat length or higher age of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data provide evidence that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>, SCA2 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> are per se more susceptible to RLS than non-affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The probability of developing RLS is related principally to the period over which the CAG repeat mutation exerts its effect and not to CAG repeat length or age of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
