<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Very little is known about the structure and the function of ataxin-3, although this information would undoubtedly help to understand why the expanded protein forms insoluble nuclear aggregates and causes neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the aim of establishing the domain architecture of ataxin-3 and the role of the polyQ tract within the protein context, we have studied the human and murine orthologues using a combination of techniques, which range from limited proteolysis to circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two protein sequences share a highly conserved N-terminus and differ only in the length of the glutamine repeats and in the C-terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data conclusively indicate that ataxin-3 is composed by a structured N-terminal domain, followed by a flexible tail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, [(15)N]glutamine selectively labelled samples allowed us to have a direct insight by NMR into the structure of the polyQ region </plain></SENT>
