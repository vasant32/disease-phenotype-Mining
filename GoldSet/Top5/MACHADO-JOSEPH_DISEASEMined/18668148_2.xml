<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This disease is characterized by the formation of intraneuronal inclusions, but the mechanism underlying their formation is still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study is to explore the relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) AT3 and polyQ expanded AT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> (N2a) cells or HEK293 cells were co-transfected with WT AT3 and different truncated forms of expanded AT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expressions of WT AT3 and the truncated forms of expanded AT3 were detected by Western blotting, and observed by an inverted fluorescent microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interactions between AT3 and different truncated forms of expanded AT3 were detected by immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using fluorescent microscope, we observed that the truncated forms of expanded AT3 aggregate in transfected cells, and the full-length WT AT3 is recruited onto the aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no aggregates were observed in cells transfected with the truncated forms of WT AT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down analyses indicate that WT AT3 interacts with the truncated AT3 in a polyQ length-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: WT AT3 deposits in the aggregation that was formed by polyQ expanded AT3, which suggests that the formation of AT3 aggregation may affect the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function of WT AT3 and increase polyQ protein toxicity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
