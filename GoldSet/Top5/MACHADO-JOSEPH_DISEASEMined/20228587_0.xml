<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: With conventional MRI and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT), accurate diagnosis and precise classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> are often difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to verify the utility of MRI voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in combination with SPECT using easy Z-score imaging (eZIS) for diagnosing and classifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed gray matter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> using VBM and blood perfusion using SPECT with eZIS in fifteen patients with different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo>, such as the cerebellar variant of multiple system <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (MSA-C), spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e>, and autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> (AICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five MSA-C patients, VBM imaging showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the brainstem, the entire cerebellar vermis, and the cerebellar hemispheres, while SPECT using eZIS showed reduced perfusion in the same regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and reduced perfusion were recognized in two of the four patients, but none exhibited abnormal findings in the posterior lobe of the cerebellar vermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SPECT showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients had obviously reduced perfusion in the anterior lobe of the vermis, but VBM demonstrated that there was no obvious <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of gray matter in any patient, meaning that the results of SPECT and VBM contradicted each other completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> and AICA patients exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and reduced perfusion in the cerebellar hemispheres but not in the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one AICA patient exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and reduced perfusion of the entire cerebellar vermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: VBM clearly showed characteristic gray matter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in the cerebellum and brainstem in different pathological conditions, thus indicating its high degree of utility in diagnosing and classifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> in combination with SPECT using eZIS </plain></SENT>
