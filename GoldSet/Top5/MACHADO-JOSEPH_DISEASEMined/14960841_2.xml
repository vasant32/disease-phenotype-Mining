<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In the context of our national program of predictive testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>), we have studied in a small rural community (1) discourses about the illness by individuals at risk and patients, and (2) how individuals at risk and patients plan to cope with the familial illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used qualitative methods, beginning with a group interview of individuals at risk, and followed by in-depth interviews (about 1 hour long) of at-risk and affected individuals, in their homes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter interviews were subjected to a content analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The coexistence of two contradictory discourses about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> (a scientific and a folk one) was found consistently among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main metaphor was that of the 'drunkard' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Knowledge about a precise diagnosis of their disease produced relief and hope, because it provided evidence that affected individuals were not drunkards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The understanding of beliefs about the disease and its social representation is essential in planning effective genetic and psychological counseling </plain></SENT>
