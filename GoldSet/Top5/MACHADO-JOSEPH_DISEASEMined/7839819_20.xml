<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is an extreme variability in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and severity of the clinical symptoms: some patients remain nearly asymptomatic throughout their entire life; others develop severe <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> and cerebellar symptoms after the age of 35 years; others suffer from a severe disorder with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in adolescence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during the third decade of life; in others the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is in early childhood with prevalence of cerebellar symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in any of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four out of five autopsies showed a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001105'>retinal atrophy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five autopsies were also characterized by (1) a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> affecting the spinocerebellar and olivocerebellar tracts, the cerebellar cortex and the efferent cerebellar pathways, (2) an involvement of the pyramidal pathways and of the motor neurons of brain stem and spinal cord, and (3) an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the subthalamic nucleus and to a much lesser extent of the pallidum, with also some damage to the substantia nigra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The posterior columns are much less affected except in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this family, we have excluded linkage with the two loci for spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, i.e., <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> on chromosome 6p and SCA2 on chromosome 12q as well as with the locus for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) on chromosome 14q </plain></SENT>
