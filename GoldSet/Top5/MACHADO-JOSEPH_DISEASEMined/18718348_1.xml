<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) mechanism triggers eye movements as a result of head motion in order to keep gaze stationary relative to the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in order to shift the direction of the gaze along with head motion, the VOR mechanism must be overridden ("cancelled") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain this cancellation: a reduction of the VOR gain or activation of smooth pursuit (SP) eye movements in the opposite direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied VOR cancellation using the magnetic search coil in six spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (SCA-3) and four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002131'>episodic ataxia</z:hpo> type 2 (EA-2) patients, conditions that are known to have degraded SP but different degrees of VOR impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004844'>Abnormal VOR</z:mp> was found in two of the four EA-2 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the SCA-3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects possessed residual VOR, although when tested using head thrusts it was almost negligible in the SCA-3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EA-2 patients showed essentially no SP and the SCA-3 patients had poor SP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the gain during VOR cancellation was comparable to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results provide additional evidence that SP cancellation of the VOR cannot be the sole mechanism utilized in overriding the VOR in these patients </plain></SENT>
