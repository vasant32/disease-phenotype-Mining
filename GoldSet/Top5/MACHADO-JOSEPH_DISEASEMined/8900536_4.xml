<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> have recently been explained through the discovery of expanded DNA repeat sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>, one of the most common spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>), caused by a CAG repeat expansion on chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A useful way of detecting repeat sequence mutations is offered by the repeat expansion detection method (RED), in which a thermostable ligase is used to detect repeat expansions directly from genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have used RED to detect CAG expansions in families with either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> or with previously uncharacterized spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (SCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> families and one SCA family where linkage to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>-5 had been excluded were analyzed by RED and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An expansion represented by RED products of 180-270 bp segregated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> (p &lt; 0.00001) in five families (n = 60) and PCR products corresponding to 66-80 repeat copies were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also detected a 210-bp RED product segregating with disease (p &lt; 0.01) in a non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>-5 family (n = 16), suggesting involvement of a CAG expansion in the pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PCR analysis subsequently revealed an elongated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> allele in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RED products detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> families correlated with elongated PCR products at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the added usefulness of RED in detecting repeat expansions in disorders where linkage is complicated by phenotyping problems in gradually developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> disorders, as in the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>-5 family examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The RED method is informative without any knowledge of flanking sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is particularly useful when studying diseases where the mutated gene is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that RED is a reliable method for analyzing expanded repeat sequences in the genome </plain></SENT>
