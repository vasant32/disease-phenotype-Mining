<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A hallmark of most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, including those caused by polyglutamine expansion, is the formation of ubiquitin (Ub)-positive protein aggregates in affected neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that the Ub system may be involved in common mechanisms underlying these otherwise unrelated diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the finding of ataxin-3 (Atx-3), whose mutation is implicated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3, in a bioinformatics search of the human genome for components of the Ub system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Atx-3 is a Ub-binding protein and that the interaction of Atx-3 with Ub is mediated by motifs homologous to those found in a proteasome subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Atx-3 and the otherwise unrelated Ub-binding protein p62/Sequestosome-1 have been shown to be sequestered into aggregates in affected neurons in several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, but the mechanism for this recruitment has remained unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this article, we show that functional Ub-binding motifs in Atx-3 and p62 proteins are required for the localization of both proteins into aggregates in a cell-based assay that recapitulates several features of polyglutamine disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that the Ub-mediated sequestration of essential Ub-binding protein(s) into aggregates may be a common mechanism contributing to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
