<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate the sense of smell in patients with molecular-proven spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> and 46 control subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sense of smell was tested using the Sniffin's Sticks (SS-16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and non-cerebellar symptoms, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035258" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">restless legs syndrome (RLS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> group had significantly lower SS-16 scores than controls (11.5 ± 2.4 vs 12.8 ± 1.5, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analyses, controlling for age, sex, education, cigarette smoking, and MMSE scores, showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> (p = 0.021), sex (p = 0.003) and MMSE scores (p = 0.002) had significant regression coefficients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the variables taken together were significantly associated with the SS-16 scores (p ≤ 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although MMSE scores and female sex were stronger predictors of the SS-16 scores than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> had lower scores on the SS-16, regardless of sex or MMSE scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, MMSE scores, sex and presence of RLS were the best predictors of SS-16 scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, our results strengthen that the sense of smell is significantly reduced in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> and that sex, MMSE scores and RLS also influence the SS-16 scores </plain></SENT>
