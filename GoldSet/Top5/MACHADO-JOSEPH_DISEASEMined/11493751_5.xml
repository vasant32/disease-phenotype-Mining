<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was thus to (1) determine the level of knowledge about the disease; (2) estimate the expected level of request for predictive testing, and (3) analyse the intentions of at-risk individuals concerning their reproductive decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire on these points was distributed to 42 affected and 36 at-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, the educational level of the respondents was significantly associated with the level of knowledge about the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The survey indicated that 83.3% of the at-risk individuals would make use of predictive test and that 77.8% would make use of prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the latter, 36.1% would terminate pregnancy if confronted with a positive result for the fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The level of knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> in the Azorean families is considered to be fair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the actual behavior can prove to be different from the intentions put forward by at-risk individuals based solely on the results of this study we can estimate that the request for a predictive test would be quite high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The intentions expressed by at-risk individuals seem to indicate that the prenatal diagnosis will have an effect on their reproductive decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results obtained certify the importance of implementing genetic testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> in the Azores </plain></SENT>
