<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Intracellular aggregates commonly forming <z:mp ids='MP_0004191'>neuronal intranuclear inclusions</z:mp> are neuropathological hallmarks of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 and of other disorders characterized by expanded polyglutamine-(poly-Q) tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To characterize cellular responses to these aggregates, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of <z:mp ids='MP_0004191'>neuronal intranuclear inclusions</z:mp> in pontine neurons of patients affected by spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3, using a panel of antibodies directed against chaperones and proteasome subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A subset of the <z:mp ids='MP_0004191'>neuronal intranuclear inclusions</z:mp> stained positively for the chaperones Hsp90alpha and HDJ-2, a member of the Hsp40 family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most <z:mp ids='MP_0004191'>neuronal intranuclear inclusions</z:mp> were ubiquitin positive, suggesting degradation by ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, only a fraction of <z:mp ids='MP_0004191'>neuronal intranuclear inclusions</z:mp> were immunopositive for antibodies directed against subunits of the 20S proteolytic core, whereas most inclusions were stained by antibodies directed against subunits of the 11S and 19S regulatory particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the proteosomal proteolytic machinery that actively degrades <z:mp ids='MP_0004191'>neuronal intranuclear inclusions</z:mp> is assembled in only a fraction of pontine neurons in end stage spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dissociation between regulatory subunits and the proteolytic core and the changes in subcellular subunit distribution suggest perturbations of the proteosomal machinery in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 brains </plain></SENT>
