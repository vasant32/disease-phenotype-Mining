<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morphometric analysis using the two-dimensional (area) measurement by CT was performed in the infratentorial region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The brain-stem index, an index of brain-stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> or pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, revealed a significant decrease (P less than 0.01), with a mean of 66.7% when compared with 16 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients showed a significant increase (P less than 0.01), with a mean of three times that of the controls in the fourth ventricular index, an index of fourth <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the cerebellar index, an index of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo>, between these patients and the controls, although the patients had an increased number of visible cerebellar vermian (2.0, SD 0.7) and hemispheric sulci (2.6 SD 0.6) as compared with the controls (vermian sulci: 0.4, SD 0.7: hemispheric sulci: 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate severe pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, fourth <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> with mild involvement of the cerebellum and correlate well with the common pathological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present morphometric evaluation by CT may be useful in the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
