<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expansion results in an expanded polyglutamine tract, which likely confers a novel, toxic function to the affected protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell culture and transgenic mouse studies have implicated the nucleus as a site for pathogenesis, suggesting that a critical nuclear factor or process is disrupted by the polyglutamine expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report we present evidence that CREB-binding protein (CBP), a transcriptional co-activator that orchestrates nuclear response to a variety of cell signaling cascades, is incorporated into nuclear inclusions formed by polyglutamine-containing proteins in cultured cells, transgenic mice and tissue from patients with SBMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also show CBP incorporation into nuclear inclusions formed in a cell culture model of another polyglutamine disease, spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We present evidence that soluble levels of CBP are reduced in cells expressing expanded polyglutamine despite increased levels of CBP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrate that over-expression of CBP rescues cells from polyglutamine-mediated toxicity in neuronal cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support a CBP-sequestration model of polyglutamine expansion disease </plain></SENT>
