<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The largest family tree of Azorean ancestry contains 622 individuals in 9 generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>236 were examined, 39 found to be affected by two examiners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phenotypes I, II and III were expressed by 12, 23 and 4 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> by phenotypes being 10-48, 14-54 and 30-55 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although clinically more severe, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003621'>juvenile onset</z:hpo> type I disease did not show as severe a ponto-mesencephalic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> on MRI as the father with type II disease of similar symptomatic duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the 8 patients examined with MRI showed olivary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> or pallidal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>12 affected and 23 at risk were evaluated with neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Verbal memory scores were below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the affected and there was greater decay with time than in the risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both scored below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in identifying silluettes and constructional praxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Visual memory scores were well below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for both, with many rotations but no omissions or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233800" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">confabulations</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A peculiar pattern of multiplying internal details called "the fly-eye effect" was observed in 6 affected and 8 at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Defective color distinction when multiple colors presented close to each other, in face of proper naming of individual colors ("color simulatanagnosia"), was looked for in 29 people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>4/10 affected and 4/19 at risk showed this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Cognitive dysfunctions</z:e> in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> family are prominent in the sphere of vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Whether they constitute an early manifestation in those at risk and thus serve as a clinical identifier of the illness is yet to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> was looked for in the history of the family with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> III-R criteria and an attempt at quantification with the Montgomery-Asberg Rating Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There was no significant quantitative difference between affected and at risk </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Fully established <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> in this family seemed to exert a protective effect from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
