<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent study reported an excess of transmission of disease chromosomes relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes from affected fathers, while this phenomenon was not observed in female meioses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data were compatible with <z:mp ids='MP_0010032'>meiotic drive</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the transmission of alleles with larger versus smaller CAG repeat numbers in the MJD1 gene in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heterozygotes from the 40 CEPH families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that there was no segregation distortion in male meioses, while the smaller CAG allele was inherited in 57% of female meioses (p &lt; 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of smaller versus larger CAG alleles at this locus was significantly different when male and female meioses were compared (p = 0.0139) </plain></SENT>
