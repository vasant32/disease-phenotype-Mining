<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of the present study were to establish the core cognitive features in our patient population and to determine the presence of Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome (CCAS) in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recruited 38 patients with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) or Machado–<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>)-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and 31 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on disease status were recorded (disease duration, age, age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> severity, and CAG repeat length) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of cerebellar symptoms was measured using the International Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> Rating Scale and the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neuropsychological assessment consisted of the Mini-Mental State Examination, Clock Drawing Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Stroop Color–Word Test, Trail-Making Test, Verbal Paired Associates, and verbal fluency tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were also submitted to the Hamilton <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Scale and Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After controlling for multiple comparisons, spatial span, picture completion, symbol search, Stroop Color–Word Test, phonemic verbal fluency, and Trail-Making Tests A and B were significantly more impaired in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> than in controls </plain></SENT>
