<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disease protein misfolding and aggregation, often within the nucleus of affected neurons, characterize polyglutamine disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several evidences have implicated the nucleus as the primary site of pathogenesis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular determinants for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of human ataxin-3 (Atx3), the protein which is mutated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, are not characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to characterize the nuclear shuttling activity of Atx3, we performed yeast nuclear import assays and found that Atx3 is actively imported into the nucleus, by means of a classical nuclear localizing sequence formed by a cluster of lysine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residues</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, when active nuclear export was inhibited using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52646">leptomycin B</z:chebi>, a specific inhibitor of the nuclear export receptor CRM1, both endogenous Atx3 and transfected GFP-Atx3 accumulated inside the nucleus of a subpopulation of COS-7 cells, whereas both proteins are normally predominant in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, using a Rev(1.4)-GFP nuclear export assay, we performed an extensive analysis of six putative aliphatic nuclear export motifs identified in Atx3 amino acid sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although none of the tested <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequences were found to drive nuclear export when isolated, we have successfully mapped the region of Atx3 responsible for its CRM1-independent nuclear export activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Curiously, the N-terminal Josephin domain alone is exported into the cytoplasm, but the nuclear export activity of Atx3 is significantly enhanced in a longer construct that is truncated after the two ubiquitin interaction motifs, upstream from the polyQ tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data show that Atx3 is actively imported to and exported from the cell nucleus, and that its nuclear export activity is dependent on a motif located at its N-terminal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since pathological Atx3 aggregates in the nucleus of affected neurons in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, and there is in vivo evidence that nuclear localization of Atx3 is required for the manifestation of symptoms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, defects in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity of the protein may be involved in the nuclear accumulation and aggregation of expanded Atx3 </plain></SENT>
