<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and distribution volume (Vd) in the pons, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex were measured in 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> by autoradiography (ARG) and the table look-up (TLU) method of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-123 IMP (123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>) single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Representative cases were as follows: A 46-year-old woman first experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo> at age 38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in the pons or cerebellum, but rCBF measured by the 123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT ARG method detected hypoperfusion in the pons, and cerebellar vermis and hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 76-year-old woman first experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo> at age 69 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT and MRI findings showed severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in the pons, and cerebellar vermis and hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, rCBF was decreased in the pons, whereas it was not decreased in the cerebellar vermis and hemisphere </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because this SPECT finding for the pons looked like a 'dot', we have called it the 'pontine dot sign' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> group, rCBF was significantly decreased in the pons (Student's t test, p &lt; 0.01) and cerebellar vermis (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Vd was also significantly decreased in the pons (p &lt; 0.005) in comparison with that for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between the Vd for the pons and age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (r = 0.59, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Pearson's correlation analysis also showed a significant relationship between the Vd in the cerebellar hemispheres and International Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> Rating Scale (r = 0.644, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the SPECT findings are indicative of underlying neurodegenerative processes that began before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Different processes seem to function in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and the rCBF decrease in the pons of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These findings will be proved by the increase of the number of cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Until now, there has been no report on rCBF and Vd obtained by 123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> identified by gene analysis </plain></SENT>
