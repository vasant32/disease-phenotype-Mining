<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to determine whether there was a higher degree of instability in affected regions, the size of the expanded CAG repeat was analyzed in different regions of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, in two unrelated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> was quantified and compared to that in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Instability of the expanded CAG repeat was observed in peripheral tissues as well as in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> of the three patients, but there was no correlation between the degree of mosaicism and the selective vulnerability of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As in the other diseases caused by expanded CAG repeats, a lower degree of mosaicism was found in the cerebellar cortex of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients, probably reflecting specific properties of this structure </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, somatic instability was more pronounced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
