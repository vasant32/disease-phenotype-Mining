<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies showed that age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is negatively correlated with the number of CAG repeat units, but only part of the variation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age is explained by CAG repeat length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ages at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and CAG repeat lengths of 136 MJD patients from 23 kindreds of Portuguese descent were analyzed, to determine whether familial factors independent of CAG repeat length modulate age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlation among sibs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age adjusted for CAG repeat length was .43, which indicates that an environmental or genetic factor common to sibs influences <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive correlations were also observed for avuncular (r = .22) and first-cousin pairs (r = .28), which supports the hypothesis that a genetic factor is influencing age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Commingling analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> ages adjusted for CAG repeat length identified three distributions in this population of affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies of a much larger sample are needed to determine whether these distributions represent the influence of a genetic or environmental factor </plain></SENT>
