<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3 (ATXN3) is a widely expressed protein that binds to ubiquitylated proteins, has deubiquitylating activity in vitro and is thought to modulate substrate degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expansion of a polyglutamine tract in ATXN3 causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorder</z:e> characterized by ubiquitin-positive aggregate formation and specific neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although ATXN3 has been involved in transcriptional repression and in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, its biological function is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this work, we show that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of ATXN3 using small-interference <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) causes a prominent phenotype in both human and mouse cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mild increase in ubiquitylation occurs and cells exhibit ubiquitin-positive foci, which is consistent with ATXN3 putative function as a deubiquitylating enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, siATXN3-silenced cells exhibit marked morphological changes such as rounder shape and loss of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> protrusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At a structural level, the microtubule, microfilament and intermediate filament networks are severely compromised and disorganized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This cytoskeletal phenotype is reversible and dependent on ATXN3 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cell-extracellular matrix connection is also affected in ATXN3-depleted cells as talin expression is reduced in the focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> and lower levels of alpha-1 integrin subunit are expressed at their surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the cytoskeletal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> problems do not originate any major change in the cell cycle of siATXN3-depleted cells, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is increased in siATXN3 cultures compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, in this work we show that the absence of ATXN3 leads to an overt cytoskeletal/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> defect raising the possibility that this protein may play a role in the cytoskeleton </plain></SENT>
