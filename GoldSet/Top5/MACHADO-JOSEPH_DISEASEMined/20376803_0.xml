<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical manifestation and the mutation characteristics of intermedial allele associated with a disease phenotype of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction, capillary electrophoresis, molecular cloning and sequencing were performed to detect the ATXN3 gene in an spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>(SCA) family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fragments of expanded alleles were subcloned into the pGEM-T plasmids and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expanded repeats at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> locus were confirmed by molecular technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proband had 43 CAG repeats at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He had two sons with 41 and 64 repeats in the expanded allele respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A 43 CAG repeat allele was unstable upon inter-generational transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The change of the CAG repeat was bidirectional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the shortest expanded allele associated with a disease phenotype in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene reported to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The identification of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> family has reduced the amplitude between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and expanded allele repeats </plain></SENT>
