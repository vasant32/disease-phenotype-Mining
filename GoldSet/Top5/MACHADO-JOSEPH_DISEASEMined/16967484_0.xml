<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the effects of repeat length have been well studied in clinical samples, there has been little investigation of the effects of triplet repeat variation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range for these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have, therefore, examined linkage and association for three CAG triplet repeat markers (Spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> Type 1, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph Disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>; Dentatorubro-pallidoluysian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>Atrophy</z:mpath>, DRPLA) to assess their contribution to variation in cognitive ability (IQ, reading ability, processing speed) in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, unselected sample of adolescent twins (248 dizygotic (DZ) sibling pairs, aged 16 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Association tests, performed in Mx and QTDT, showed a consistent positive association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> with Arithmetic (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While association was supported between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> and Cambridge reading scores and between DRPLA and inspection time, results were inconsistent across software packages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given the number of statistical tests performed, it is unlikely that trinucleotide repeat variation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range for these genes influences variation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition </plain></SENT>
