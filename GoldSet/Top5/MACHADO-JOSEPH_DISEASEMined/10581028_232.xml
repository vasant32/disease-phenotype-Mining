<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>At least eight inherited human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> are caused by expansion of a polyglutamine domain within the respective proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This confers dominant toxicity on the proteins, leading to dysfunction and loss of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expanded polyglutamine proteins form aggregates, including nuclear inclusions (NI), within neurons, possibly due to misfolding of the proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NI are ubiquitinated and sequester molecular chaperone proteins and proteasome components, suggesting that disease pathogenesis includes activation of cellular stress pathways to help refold, disaggregate or degrade the mutant disease proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of specific chaperone proteins reduces polyglutamine aggregation in transfected cells, but whether this alters toxicity is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a Drosophila melanogaster model of polyglutamine disease, we show that directed expression of the molecular chaperone HSP70 suppresses polyglutamine-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Suppression by HSP70 occurred without a visible effect on NI formation, indicating that polyglutamine toxicity can be dissociated from formation of large aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our studies indicate that HSP70 or related molecular chaperones may provide a means of treating these and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> associated with abnormal protein conformation and toxicity </plain></SENT>
