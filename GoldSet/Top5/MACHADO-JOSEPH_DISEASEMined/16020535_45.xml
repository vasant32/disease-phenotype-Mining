<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have determined the solution structure of Josephin and shown that it belongs to the family of papain-like cysteine proteases, sharing the highest degree of structural similarity with <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> staphopain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A currently unique structural feature of Josephin is a flexible helical hairpin formed by a 32-residue insertion, which could determine substrate specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using the Josephin structure and the availability of NMR chemical shift assignments, we have mapped the enzyme active site by using the typical cysteine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi>, transepoxysuccinyl-L-eucylamido-4-guanidino-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="37808">butane</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30270">E-64</z:chebi>) and [L-3-trans-(propylcarbamyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">oxirane</z:chebi>-2-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi>]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30009,32606">L-isoleucyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17203">L-proline</z:chebi> (CA-074) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate that the specific interaction of Josephin with the ubiquitin-like domain of the ubiquitin- and proteasome-binding factor HHR23B involves complementary exposed hydrophobic surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The structural similarity with other deubiquitinating enzymes suggests a model for the proteolytic enzymatic activity of ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
