<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-sense mutations in the human VCP gene have been identified in patients suffering inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029401" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Paget disease of bone</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (IBMPFD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have shown that VCP possesses both aggregate-forming and aggregate-clearing activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we showed that in cells treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitors</z:chebi> VCP first appeared as several small aggregates throughout the cells; and then, these small aggregates gathered together into a single big aggregate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subcellular localization and ATPase activity of VCP clearly influenced the localization of the aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested IBMPFD-causing mutant VCPs, possessed elevated ATPase activities and enhanced aggregate-forming activities in cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Drosophila, these mutants and VCP(T761E), a super active VCP, did not appear to spontaneously induce eye degeneration, but worsened the phenotype when co-expressed with polyglutamines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, these VCPs did not apparently change sizes and the amounts of polyglutamine aggregates in Drosophila eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated ATPase activities, thus, may be a hidden primary defect causing IBMPFD pathological phenotypes, which would be revealed when abnormal proteins are accumulated, as typically observed in aging </plain></SENT>
