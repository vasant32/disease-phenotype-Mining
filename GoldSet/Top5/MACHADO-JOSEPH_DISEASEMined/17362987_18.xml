<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The polyglutamine diseases are a family of nine proteins where intracellular protein misfolding and amyloid-like fibril formation are intrinsically coupled to disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we identified a complex two-step mechanism of fibril formation of pathologically expanded ataxin-3, the causative protein of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type-3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, ataxin-3 lacking a polyglutamine tract also formed fibrils, although this occurred only via a single-step that was homologous to the first step of expanded ataxin-3 fibril formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the first kinetic analysis of a disease-associated polyglutamine repeat protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that ataxin-3 forms amyloid-like fibrils by a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We kinetically model the nucleating event in ataxin-3 fibrillogenesis to the formation of a monomeric thermodynamic nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fibril elongation then proceeds by a mechanism of monomer addition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of an expanded polyglutamine tract leads subsequently to rapid inter-fibril association and formation of large, highly stable amyloid-like fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results enhance our general understanding of polyglutamine fibrillogenesis and highlights the role of non-poly(Q) domains in modulating the kinetics of misfolding in this family </plain></SENT>
