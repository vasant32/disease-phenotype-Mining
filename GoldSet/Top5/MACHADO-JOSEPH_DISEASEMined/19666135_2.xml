<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3 consists of an N-terminal globular Josephin domain and an unstructured C-terminal region containing a stretch of consecutive glutamines that triggers an inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorder</z:e>, spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3, when its length exceeds a critical threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathology results from protein misfolding and intracellular accumulation of fibrillar amyloid-like aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plenty of work has been carried out to elucidate the protein's physiological role(s), which has shown that ataxin-3 is multifunctional; it acts as a transcriptional repressor, and also has polyubiquitin-binding/ubiquitin-hydrolase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, a recent report shows that it participates in sorting misfolded protein to aggresomes, close to the microtubule-organizing center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since a thorough understanding of the protein's physiological role(s) requires the identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the molecular partners interacting with ataxin-3, we pursued this goal by taking advantage of two-dimensional chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that different ataxin-3 constructs, including the sole Josephin domain, bound alpha- and beta-tubulin from soluble rat brain extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed this interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ataxin-3 overexpressed in COS7 cultured cells partially colocalized with microtubules, whereas an expanded variant only occasionally did so, probably due to aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, by surface plasmon resonance we determined a dissociation constant of 50-70nM between ataxin-3 and tubulin dimer, which strongly supports the hypothesis of a direct interaction of this protein with microtubules in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest an involvement of ataxin-3 in directing aggregated protein to aggresomes, and shed light on the mode of interaction among the different molecular partners participating in the process </plain></SENT>
