<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A family of German extraction with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002073'>progressive ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000496'>eye movement abnormalities</z:hpo>, peripheral sensory loss, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007269'>spinal muscular atrophy</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three members came to autopsy, and neuropathologically, the major changes included varying degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the basis pontis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002503'>degeneration of the spinocerebellar tracts</z:hpo>, Clarke's columns, anterior horn neurons, and fasciculus gracilis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dentate nucleus was spared, and there was slight neuron loss from the substantia nigra in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinically and neuropathologically, our family resembles that reported by Boller and Segarra as having spinopontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, several kindreds with similar findings have recently been described as having Azorean or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> in non-Portuguese families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of clinical and neuropathological features in spinopontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>, both in Portuguese and non-Portuguese families, reveals clinical and pathological similarities and differences between the two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The major differences in our patients include only minor extraocular movement abnormality and absence of protuberant eyes, and muscular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> clinically, and the sparing of the substantia nigra and the dentate nucleus neuropathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences suggest that spinopontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, as manifested in our family, is distinct from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our family showed no linkage to the HLA locus on chromosome 6 </plain></SENT>
