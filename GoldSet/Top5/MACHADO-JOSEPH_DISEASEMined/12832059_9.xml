<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene has been identified as the pathologic mutation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, human SK-N-SH <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells stably transfected with full-length <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> with 78 CAG repeats were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with the parental cells, cells expressing mutant ataxin-3 displayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> for over 80 generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Less than 1% of the transfected cells contained nuclear aggregates under basal conditions, indicating that this cellular model represented an early disease stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">t-butyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923">hydroperoxide</z:chebi> (TBH) was used to assess the oxidative tolerance of cells, the results demonstrated that the transfected cells were more susceptible to low concentrations of TBH than the parental cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most interestingly, from 2D gel electrophoresis analysis, we identified that the expression of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), known as a suppressor of poly(Q)-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, dramatically decreased in SK-N-SH cells stably transfected with full-length mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same reduction of HSP27 was further confirmed in lymphoblastoid cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that both neuronal and non-neuronal cells with expanded full-length ataxin-3 revealed reduced protein expression of HSP27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that the reduction of HSP27 in the early stage of the disease plays an important role during cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> process in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
