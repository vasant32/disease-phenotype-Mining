<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This protein consists of a folded N-terminal domain (Josephin domain, residues 1-182), a central flexible region (residues 183-291), a poly-glutamine sequence of variable length and a short C-terminal flexible region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Very little is known about the influence of the central flexible region on the conformational and aggregation properties of this protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to investigate the specific role of this portion of the protein (residues 183-291) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, protein fragments 1-182 (AT3/182) and 1-291 (AT3/291) were produced and compared by thioflavin-T fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, CD, intrinsic fluorescence and ESI-MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is shown that the central flexible region enhances protein aggregation and can populate conformational states with different degrees of compactness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both monomeric and dimeric partially-folded forms are identified for both protein fragments under denaturing conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Partially-folded monomers and dimers accumulate to a larger extent in AT3/291 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These species represent good candidates for early intermediates of the aggregation process under the experimental conditions employed in the present study </plain></SENT>
