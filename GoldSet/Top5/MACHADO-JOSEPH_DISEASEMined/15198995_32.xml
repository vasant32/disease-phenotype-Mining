<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UBB(+1), an aberrant form of ubiquitin, is a substrate and inhibitor of the proteasome, and was previously reported to accumulate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949664" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tauopathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show accumulation of UBB(+1) in the NIIs and the cytoplasm of neurons in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington disease</z:e> and spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type-3, indicating inhibition of the proteasome by polyglutamine proteins in human brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that UBB(+1) not only increased aggregate formation of expanded polyglutamines in neuronally differentiated cell lines, but also had a synergistic effect on apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to expanded polyglutamine proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings implicate UBB(+1) as an aggravating factor in polyglutamine-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo>, and clearly identify an important role for the ubiquitin-proteasome system in polyglutamine diseases </plain></SENT>
