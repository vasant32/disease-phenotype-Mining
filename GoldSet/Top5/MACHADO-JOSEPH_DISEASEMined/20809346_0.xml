<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DAT scan showed significant asymmetric decreased binding in the striatum in the two members with predominant parkinsonian phenotype, with mild and symmetric decreased binding in the member with the cerebellar phenotype, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the asymptomatic member </plain></SENT>
