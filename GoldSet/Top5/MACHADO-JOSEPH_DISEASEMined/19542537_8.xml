<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that protein casein kinase 2 (CK2)-dependent phosphorylation controls the nuclear localization, aggregation and stability of ataxin-3 (ATXN3), the disease protein in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serine 340 and 352 within the third ubiquitin-interacting motif of ATXN3 were particularly important for nuclear localization of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and expanded ATXN3 and mutation of these sites robustly reduced the formation of nuclear inclusions; a putative nuclear leader sequence was not required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ATXN3 associated with CK2alpha and pharmacological inhibition of CK2 decreased nuclear ATXN3 levels and the formation of nuclear inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found that ATXN3 shifted to the nucleus upon thermal stress in a CK2-dependent manner, indicating a key role of CK2-mediated phosphorylation of ATXN3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
