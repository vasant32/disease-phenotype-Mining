<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> is a common <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> caused by an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003394'>Muscle cramps</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002380'>fasciculations</z:hpo> are frequent and sometimes disabling manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, their frequency and pathophysiological mechanisms remain largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> (hereinafter <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients) with molecular confirmation were assessed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A standard questionnaire addressing clinical features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003394'>muscle cramps</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002380'>fasciculations</z:hpo> was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Cramps Disability Scale was used to quantify cramps-related disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent neurophysiological testing with routine techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>F waves of the right median nerves were obtained, and persistence indexes were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four muscles (deltoid, first dorsal interossei, tibialis anterior, and vastus lateralis) were examined by needle electromyography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A semiquantitative scale (from 0 [no activity] to 4 [continuous activity]) was used to determine the frequency of rest <z:hpo ids='HP_0002380'>fasciculations</z:hpo> in each muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients (29 men) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Their mean age at examination was 46.3 years, their mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease was 35 years, and the mean duration of disease was 11.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Abnormal CAG(n) varied from 59 to 75 repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003394'>muscle cramps</z:hpo>; in 10, this was their first symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The frequency of cramps varied between 1 and 90 episodes a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>For 15 patients, cramps were the chief complaint, frequently disturbing sleep or work (Cramps Disability Scale score, 2 or 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Lower limbs were affected in 37 individuals, but unusual regions, such as the face and abdominal muscles, were also involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002380'>Fasciculations</z:hpo> were found in 25 individuals; in 8 patients, they included facial muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002380'>fasciculations</z:hpo> were not a significant complaint for any of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The clinical and neurophysiological profile of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients with and without cramps was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002380'>fasciculations</z:hpo> had more severe damage to their peripheral nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Muscle excitability abnormalities were found in 41 MJD patients (82%), and they were the presenting complaint in 10 (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>They are related to altered excitability of peripheral motor axons, but mechanisms underlying cramps and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002380'>fasciculations</z:hpo> are possibly distinct in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
