<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the first prenatal diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> in Taiwan in a woman whose husband was known to carry an unstable CAG repeat expansion in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After evaluating the couples' motivation and psychological tolerance, amniocentesis was performed at gestation of 13 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made using a simple nonradioactive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for rapid detection of the presence of an expanded <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, using radioactive PCR, we identified the presence of an unusual shortness of CAG expansion in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene with 74 repeats in the fetus compared with 78 repeats in the father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After termination of the pregnancy, Western blot analysis further confirmed the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant ataxin-3 in the fetal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have performed the first prenatal diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> in Taiwan, and described our experience with an at-risk male requesting counseling, carrier testing, and prenatal diagnosis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early detection of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and expanded ataxin-3 in fetal tissues was first demonstrated in the present study </plain></SENT>
