<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>98, 11955-11960] showed that a nonexpanded ataxin-3 (Q27) was fully soluble, whereas an expanded form (Q78) gave rise to amyloid fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Here, we report investigations on three forms of ataxin-3 (i.e., human nonexpanded (Q26), moderately expanded (Q36) ataxins-3, and the murine protein (Q6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Far-UV circular dichroism spectra at room temperature were substantially similar, with a relatively high helical content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On heating to 96 degrees C, human Q26 and murine proteins did not display large structural changes, nor did they undergo any precipitation, which highlights their amazing heat-resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, human Q36 ataxin-3 underwent a progressive increase in the beta-sheet and a concomitant decrease in helical content when the temperature was shifted from 37 to 80 degrees C, followed by the irreversible formation of aggregates above 80 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>They were shown to consist of amyloid fibrils, as supported by both electron microscopy images and the typical spectral shift displayed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo red</z:chebi> when it was added to the protein at growing temperatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We also found that protein precipitation could be prevented by mixing the dye with Q36 ataxin-3 prior to heating, which also confirms that the precipitates do represent authentic amyloid fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In contrast, other compounds structurally related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo red</z:chebi> did not exert significant effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Our observations suggest that the temperature of the observed transition is inversely related to the length of the expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Finally, we suggest that antiamyloidogenic compounds might be selected on the basis of their ability to block or retard human Q36 ataxin-3 precipitation on heat-treatment </plain></SENT>
