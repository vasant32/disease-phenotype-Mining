<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide insight into the mechanism by which ubiquitination directly enhances the activity of ataxin-3, a DUb implicated in protein quality control and the disease protein in the polyglutamine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorder</z:e>, Spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> Type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identify Lys-117, which resides near the catalytic triad, as the primary site of ubiquitination in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and pathogenic ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further studies indicate that ubiquitin-dependent activation of ataxin-3 at Lys-117 is important for its ability to reduce high molecular weight ubiquitinated species in cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitination at Lys-117 also facilitates the ability of ataxin-3 to induce aggresome formation in cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, structure-function studies support a model of activation whereby ubiquitination at Lys-117 enhances ataxin-3 activity independent of the known ubiquitin-binding sites in ataxin-3, most likely through a direct conformational change in or near the catalytic domain </plain></SENT>
