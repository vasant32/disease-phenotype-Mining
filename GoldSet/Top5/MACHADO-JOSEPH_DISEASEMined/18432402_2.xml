<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue expression analysis showed the swine MJD1, CDC42, and NECD genes were obviously differentially expressed in different tissues including muscle, heart, liver, backfat, kidney, lung, small intestine, and large intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our experiment established the primary foundation for further research on these three swine genes </plain></SENT>
