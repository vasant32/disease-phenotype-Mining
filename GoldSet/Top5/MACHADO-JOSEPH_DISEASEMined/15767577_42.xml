<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The polyglutamine-containing neurodegenerative protein ataxin 3 (AT3) has deubiquitylating activity and binds ubiquitin chains with a preference for chains of four or more ubiquitins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we characterize the deubiquitylating activity of AT3 in vitro and show it trims/edits K48-linked ubiquitin chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AT3 also edits polyubiquitylated (125)I-lysozyme and decreases its degradation by proteasomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cellular studies show that endogenous AT3 colocalizes with aggresomes and preaggresome particles of the misfolded cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> transmembrane regulator (CFTR) mutant CFTRDeltaF508 and associates with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase 6 and dynein, proteins required for aggresome formation and transport of misfolded protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> knockdown of AT3 greatly reduces aggresomes formed by CFTRDeltaF508, demonstrating a critical role of AT3 in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> AT3 restores aggresome formation; however, AT3 with mutations in the active site or ubiquitin interacting motifs cannot restore aggresome formation in AT3 knockdown cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These same mutations decrease the association of AT3 and dynein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the deubiquitylating activity of AT3 and its ubiquitin interacting motifs as well play essential roles in CFTRDeltaF508 aggresome formation </plain></SENT>
