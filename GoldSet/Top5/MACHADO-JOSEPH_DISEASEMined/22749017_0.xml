<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, automated high-resolution behavior test systems such as the homecage based LabMaster system are of particular interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the power of the automated LabMaster system by discovering previously unrecognized features of a recently characterized atxn3 mutant mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This model provided neurological symptoms including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at the age of 12 months usually detectable just 2 weeks before the mice died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, using the LabMaster system we were able to detect <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>hypoactivity</z:mp> in presymptomatic mutant mice in the dark as well as light phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we analyzed <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, immunological and hematological parameters, which indicated a reduced immune defense in phenotypic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that a detailed characterization even of organ systems that are usually not affected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> is important for further studies of pathogenesis and required for the preclinical therapeutic studies </plain></SENT>
