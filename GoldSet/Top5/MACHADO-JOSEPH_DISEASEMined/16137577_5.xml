<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of chaperone proteins and the application of chemical chaperones are reported to suppress polyglutamine induced cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of compatible solutes, which are osmoprotectants in bacteria and possess the action in stabilizing proteins under stress, have not, to our knowledge, been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We explored the protective effects of the compatible solutes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27592">ectoine</z:chebi>, hydroxyectoine, and betaine on apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> produced by the truncated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene product with an expanded polyglutamine tract in cultured neuro2a cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27592">Ectoine</z:chebi>, but not hydroxyectoine or betaine, decreased large cytoplasmic inclusions and increased the frequency of nuclear inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27592">ectoine</z:chebi> reduced the total amount of aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the presence of nuclear inclusions, apoptotic features were less frequently observed after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27592">ectoine</z:chebi> application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27592">ectoine</z:chebi>, a natural osmoprotectant in bacteria, may function as a novel molecule protecting cells from polyglutamine-induced toxicity </plain></SENT>
