<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) is one of at least six <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> caused by expansion of a CAG repeat encoding a polyglutamine tract in the disease protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the molecular mechanism of disease, we isolated both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and expanded repeat MJD1 cDNAs, and generated antiserum against the recombinant gene product, called ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using this antiserum, we demonstrate that in disease tissue, both the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant ataxin-3 protein are expressed throughout the body and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions of the brain examined, including areas generally spared by disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In brain, certain regions (the striatum, for example) express ataxin-3 in only a limited subset of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunolocalization studies in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and disease brain, and in transfected cells, indicate that ataxin-3 is predominantly a cytoplasmic protein that localizes to neuronal processes as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, as in other polyglutamine repeat diseases, cellular expression of the disease gene is not itself sufficient to cause <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp>; other cell-specific factors must be invoked to explain the restricted neuropathology seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The restricted expression of ataxin-3 in certain regions, however, may influence the pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> and provide clues to the protein's function </plain></SENT>
