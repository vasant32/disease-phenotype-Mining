<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a series of deletion constructs expressing ataxin-3 fragments with expanded polyglutamine stretches, we observed aggregate formation and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in cultured BHK-21 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic effect of N-terminal-truncated ataxin-3 with the expanded polyglutamine tract was enhanced under serum starvation culture, in which cells were arrested in the G(0)/G(1)phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coexpression of p21 (waf1/cip1/sdi1), a cyclin-Cdk inhibitor that induced cell cycle arrest in the G(1)phase, also increased the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> susceptibility produced by the mutant ataxin-3 fragment in BHK-21 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The elevated susceptibility to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the G(0)/G(1)phase was confirmed in nerve growth factor-treated, postmitotic neuronal PC12 cells compared with undifferentiated proliferating PC12 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that the cellular toxicity of truncated ataxin-3 with an expanded polyglutamine stretch is enhanced by cell cycle arrest in the G(0)/G(1)phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutant ataxin-3 may confer a higher susceptibility to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> on cells in the G(0)/G(1)phase </plain></SENT>
