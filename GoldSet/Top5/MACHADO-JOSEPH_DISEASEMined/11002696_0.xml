<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two symptomatic and other two asymptomatic members of the family were clinically examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological evaluation included multimodal evoked potentials, quantitative electromyography and nerve conduction studies, and central motor conduction time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also report neuropathological findings in the sural nerve biopsy in the proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> CAG trinucleotide repeat at the ataxin 3 gene in the DNA of the proband and one of his daughters demonstrated an expanded allele of 63 CAG repeat units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ataxic pursuit was primary disturbed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000640'>gaze evoked nystagmus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007338'>hypermetric saccades</z:hpo> and glissades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Limitation of vertical and horizontal gaze, impaired sinusoidal vestibulo-ocular reflex and vestibulo-ocular reflex-fixation-suppression, and active and passive optokinetic nistagmus loss appeared at later stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evoked potential studies showed multimodal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological and sural nerve biopsy findings correspond well to a pattern of both anterior horn and root ganglion cell distal dominant degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Central motor conduction time was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in our patients up to advanced stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Electrophysiological and neuropathological studies suggested widespread peripheral and central affection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Repeated application of electrophysiological techniques may prove useful for monitoring disease progress </plain></SENT>
