<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Atx3 is a transcriptional co-repressor, as well as a deubiquitinating enzyme that appears to function in cellular pathways involved in protein homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that interactions of Atx3 with valosin-containing protein and hHR23B are dynamic and modulated by proteotoxic stresses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heat shock, a general proteotoxic stress, also induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and pathogenic Atx3 to accumulate in the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mapping studies showed that two regions of Atx3, the Josephin domain and the C-terminus, regulated heat shock-induced nuclear localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heat shock-induced nuclear localization of Atx3 was not affected by a casein kinase-2 inhibitor or by mutating a predicted nuclear localization signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, serine-111 of Atx3 was required for nuclear localization of the Josephin domain and regulated nuclear localization of full-length Atx3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Atx3 null cells were more sensitive to toxic effects of heat shock suggesting that Atx3 had a protective function in the cellular response to heat shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we found that <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> also induced nuclear localization of Atx3; both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and pathogenic Atx3 accumulated in the nucleus of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patient fibroblasts following <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Heat shock and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> are the first processes identified that increase nuclear localization of Atx3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Observations in this study provide new and important insights for understanding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> pathology as the nucleus is likely a key site for early pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
