<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pre-Bötzinger complex has been identified as an essential part of the medullary respiratory network in mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although well described in experimental animals, its localization in the human brain has remained elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using serially sectioned brainstems from 19 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> (multiple system <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, n = 10; spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3, n = 8), we have identified a circumscribed area of the ventrolateral medulla that represents the human homologue of the pre-Bötzinger complex and have mapped its longitudinal and horizontal extents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presumed human pre-Bötzinger complex is characterized by an aggregation of loosely scattered, small and lipofuscin-rich neurons, which contain neurokinin 1 receptor as well as somatostatin, but are negative for markers of monoaminergic neurons and of motoneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In brains of patients suffering from multiple systems <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (with central respiratory deficits but without swallowing problems), pre-Bötzinger complex neurons were reduced, whereas pharyngeal motoneurons of the ambigual nucleus were not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in brains of patients with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> 3 (no reported central respiratory deficits but with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>), pre-Bötzinger complex neurons were preserved, whereas ambigual motoneurons, which control swallowing, were diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These pathoanatomical findings support the view, that affection of the central respiratory network, including the pre-Bötzinger complex, contributes to breathing disorders in multiple system <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, whereas damage to ambigual motoneurons is important for pathogenesis of breathing disturbances and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in patients with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these findings, the putative human homologue of the pre-Bötzinger complex can now be reliably delineated on pigment-Nissl-stained sections, making neuropathological investigations of central respiratory disturbances feasible </plain></SENT>
