<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the clinical data of 201 unrelated Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rare clinical features were summarized and the underlying genetic mutations were screened by direct DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients were found primarily presenting with the rare clinical features, including dystonic phenotype without response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15765">levodopa</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> and memory decline, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>hearing impairment</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We firstly reported three diverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients, which are quite uncommon in the Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results expanded the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>variable phenotypes</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> and provided the explicit information for the rare and special <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on this new knowledge, we suggested that when the presentation was consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> or DRD while negative in the corresponding genetic testing, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> should be considered, and clinicians should divert partial attention to the examinations on the auditory system of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
