<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that considerable progress has been made in the last 20 years regarding the three-phase process of ingestion and the lower brain stem nuclei involved in it, no comprehensive descriptions of the ingestion-related lower brain stem nuclei are available for neuropathologists confronted with ingestive malfunctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we propose guidelines for the pathoanatomical investigation of these nuclei based on current knowledge with respect to ingestion and the nuclei responsible for this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The application of these guidelines is described by drawing upon the example of the lower brain stem of a male patient with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3, also known as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>, who displayed malfunctions during the preparatory phase of ingestion, as well as lingual and pharyngeal phases of swallowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By way of the representative application of the recommended investigation procedure to 100 microm serial sections through the patient's brain stem stained for lipofuscin pigment and Nissl material, we observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> together with <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the ingestion-related lower brain stem nuclei (motor, principal and spinal trigeminal nuclei; facial nucleus; parvocellular reticular nucleus; ambiguous nucleus, motor nucleus of the dorsal glossopharyngeal and vagal area; gelatinous, medial, parvocellular and pigmented solitary nuclei; hypoglossal nucleus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In view of their known functional role in the three-phase process of ingestion, damage to these nuclei not only offers an explanation of the patient's malfunctions related to the preparatory phase of ingestion and lingual and pharyngeal phases of swallowing, but also suggests that the patient may have suffered from additional esophageal phase swallowing malfunctions not mentioned in his medical records </plain></SENT>
