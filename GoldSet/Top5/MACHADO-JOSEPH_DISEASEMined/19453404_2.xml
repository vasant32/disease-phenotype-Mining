<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical overlap between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> complicated hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001258'>spastic paraplegia</z:hpo> (AD-<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>) is extensive and the differentiation between them can be difficult on clinical ground </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, patients are seeking the right diagnosis and it is important for neurologists to distinguish them in the early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In recent 10 years, we have recruited and followed-up three families which were initially diagnosed as complicated AD-<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> based on the clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutation analyses of SPG4, SPG3A and ATXN3 were performed in the index cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No mutations on SPG4 and SPG3A were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis of ATXN3 showed that these cases have one expanded allele and one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The copy numbers of CAG repeats were 80/28, 86/28 and 83/33, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The molecular diagnosis confirmed that they were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients though they had been misdiagnosed as complicated AD-<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> for many years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The copy numbers of expanded allele were more than 80 and the copy numbers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele were more than 27, which could somewhat explain the earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age of these cases and the anticipation of the pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data emphasize the necessity to perform the mutation analysis of ATXN3 in clinically diagnosed complicated AD-<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
