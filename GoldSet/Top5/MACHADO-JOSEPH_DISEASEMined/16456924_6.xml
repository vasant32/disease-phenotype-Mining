<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that the entrapment of transcription factors in aggregates plays an important role in pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now report that the transcriptional activity of CBP is already repressed in the early time points by soluble mutant huntingtin, whereas the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylase activity of CBP/p300 is gradually diminished over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutant huntingtin bound much stronger to CBP than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> huntingtin, possibly contributing to repression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Especially at the later time points, CBP protein level was gradually reduced via the proteasome pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In sharp contrast, p300 was unaffected by mutant huntingtin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This selective degradation of CBP was absent in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, mutant huntingtin specifically affects CBP and not p300 both at the early and later time points, via multiple mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to the reduction of CBP, also the altered ratio of these closely related <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> transferases may affect chromatin structure and transcription and thus contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
