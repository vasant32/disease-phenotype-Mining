<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3, the causative protein of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, contains a globular, structured N-terminal domain (the Josephin domain) and a flexible polyQ-containing C-terminal tail, the repeat-length of which modulates pathogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the fibrillogenesis pathway of ataxin-3 begins with a non-polyQ-dependent step mediated by Josephin domain interactions, followed by a polyQ-dependent step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test the involvement of the Josephin domain in ataxin-3 fibrillogenesis, we have created both pathogenic and nonpathogenic length ataxin-3 variants with a stabilized Josephin domain, and have both stabilized and destabilized the isolated Josephin domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that changing the thermodynamic stability of the Josephin domain modulates ataxin-3 fibrillogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data support the hypothesis that the first stage of ataxin-3 fibrillogenesis is caused by interactions involving the non-polyQ containing Josephin domain and that the thermodynamic stability of this domain is linked to the aggregation propensity of ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
