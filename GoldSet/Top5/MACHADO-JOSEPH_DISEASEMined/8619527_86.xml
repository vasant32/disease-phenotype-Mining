<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty families of different geographic origin with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> (ADCA) type I were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four families (126 patients) carried an expanded CAG repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expanded and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele did not overlap and the repeat was unstable during transmission, with variation in the size of the CAG length ranging from -8 to +5 and a mean expansion of 0.86 repeats without differences according to the parental sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a combined effect of the number of CAG repeats of the expanded and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele on the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, which accounted for 70% of its variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The length of the CAG repeat influenced the frequency of clinical signs associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo>, such as abnormal tendon reflexes or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002495'>decreased vibration sense</z:hpo>, whereas the interindividual variation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000623'>supranuclear ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo>, sphincter and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>swallowing difficulties</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>amyotrophy</z:hpo> was mostly determined by different disease durations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared the clinical profile of 91 SCA3/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients with 51 SCA1 and 32 SCA2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were striking differences between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and SCA2 but not with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> groups of patients </plain></SENT>
