<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although a significant positive correlation has been reported between infratentorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and the number of expanded CAG repeat units, the exact changing course of brainstem size in the individual case remains to be resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated seven cases of genetically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> longitudinally by magnetic resonance imaging with observation periods of 4.5-10.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurement of the midsagittal areas of infratentorial structures disclosed progressive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the pontine base and cerebellum, which correlated significantly with age, whilst midbrain and pontine tegmentum showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> with no significant progression, suggesting it was better identified as 'small size' and might have mostly been completed before the initial symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such differences between regions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> progression must be caused by a difference in the neuropathological course </plain></SENT>
