<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The spatial pattern of tissue-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> in the CAG repeat size was significantly different among the DRPLA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and SBMA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The size of the major bands of the mutant CAG repeat allele was significantly smaller in the cerebellar cortex in both DRPLA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients by 6 and 2 repeat units respectively and larger in the colon and liver of DRPLA by 5 repeats or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were also 1-2 repeat-sized small variations of major band size among the neural tissues in DRPLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no tissue-specific variation of major bands of CAG repeats and diversity of extra bands among the examined tissues including the cerebellum in the SBMA patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no parallel occurrence of tissue-specific CAG instability and severity of neuropathological involvement in the neural and nonneural tissues of DRPLA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and SBMA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lack of significant tissue-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> in SBMA including the cerebellar cortex may suggest that CAG repeat expansion in the mutant <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor gene is far more stable compared with that in DRPLA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> as well as those reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
