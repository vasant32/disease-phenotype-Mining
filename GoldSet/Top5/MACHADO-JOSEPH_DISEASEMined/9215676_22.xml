<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The segregation ratio between single sperm with an expanded allele and those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele is significantly different (P &lt;0.0001) from the expected 1:1 segregation ratio, which demonstrates segregation distortion of expanded alleles in male meiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In single sperm from individuals with the [expanded (CAG)n-CGG]/[<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (CAG)n-GGG] genotype, significantly greater instability of the CAG repeat was observed compared with single sperm from individuals with the [expanded (CAG)n-CGG]/[<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (CAG)n-CGG] genotype (F-test, P &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings in single sperm confirm non-Mendelian transmission of the MJD1 gene and the effect of the intragenic CGG/GGG polymorphism on the intergenerational instability of the CAG repeats in the MJD1 gene, which have been observed in clinical and genetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate similarities and dissimilarities between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> or myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> in terms of the inter-allelic interaction, segregation distortions and size distribution of trinucleotide repeats in mutant alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further study is required to determine whether there is a common mechanism underlying the instability of the triplet repeats in 'triplet repeat diseases' </plain></SENT>
