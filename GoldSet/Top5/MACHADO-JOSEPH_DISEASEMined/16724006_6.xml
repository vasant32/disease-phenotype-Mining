<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the intense debate around the repeat instability reported on the large group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions, little is known about the mutation process underlying alleles in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range that, ultimately, expand to pathological size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the mutation mechanisms by which <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) alleles have been generated throughout human evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Haplotypes including the CAG repeat, six intragenic SNPs and four flanking microsatellites were analysed in 431 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes of European, Asian and African origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A bimodal CAG repeat length frequency distribution was found in the four most frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> lineages (H1-GCGGCA; H2-GTGGCA; H3-TTAGAC and H4-TTACAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on flanking microsatellite haplotypes, the variance calculated by analysis of molecular variance between modal (CAG)n alleles was little or null in lineages H1, H2 and H4, as were the pairwise differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, genetic distances among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the alleles from each lineage did not reflect the allele sizes differences, as expected if a stepwise mutation model was the main process of evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, when exposed in maximum parsimonious phylogenetic trees, a large number of mutation steps separated same-size alleles, whereas several microsatellite haplotypes were shared by modal CAGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results suggest that the main mutation mechanism occurring in the evolution of the polymorphic CAG region at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> locus is a multistep one, either by gene conversion or DNA slippage; repeats with 14, 21, 23 and 27 CAGs are the main alleles involved in this process </plain></SENT>
