<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to analyze whether symptoms caused by ataxin-3 with an expanded repeat are reversible in vivo, we generated a conditional mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> using the Tet-Off system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a full-length human ataxin-3 cDNA with 77 repeats in order to generate the responder mouse line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After crossbreeding with a PrP promoter mouse line, double transgenic mice developed a progressive neurological phenotype characterized by neuronal dysfunction in the cerebellum, reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo>, impaired Rotarod performance and lower body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When ataxin-3 expression was turned off in symptomatic mice in an early disease state, the transgenic mice were indistinguishable from negative controls after 5 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results show that reducing the production of pathogenic ataxin-3 indeed may be a promising approach to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, provided that such treatment is applied before irreversible damage has taken place and that it is continued for a sufficiently long time </plain></SENT>
