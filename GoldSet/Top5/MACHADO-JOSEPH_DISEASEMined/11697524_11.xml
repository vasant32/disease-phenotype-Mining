<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: (1) To verify the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>, SCA2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, DRPLA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e> and SCA8 in a series of new SCA patients from South Brazil and (2) to compare their molecular and clinical characteristics with other patients previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-six cases were included in the present study: 52 were familial and 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of the trinucleotide repeat loci were performed according to methods in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 92% of families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> segregated the MJD1 mutation,2% of families segregated the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e> mutation and 6% remained undiagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>isolated cases</z:hpo>, one showed the SCA8 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical and molecular findings were similar to those already described in the literature, but revealed (1) one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e> patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0006166'>eyelid retraction</z:mp>, a sign usually related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>; and (2) one <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> case of SCA8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> cases was very high, probably reflecting an Azorean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated frequency of affected individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, in our region, was 1.8 / 100,000, and of SCAs other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, 0.2/100,000 </plain></SENT>
