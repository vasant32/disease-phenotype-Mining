<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3 (AT3), the disease protein in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>), has been associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome system and transcriptional regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT3 binds to target DNA sequences in specific chromatin regions of the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) gene promoter and represses transcription by recruitment of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR), and deacetylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> bound to the promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and expanded AT3 physiologically interacted with HDAC3 and NCoR in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> cell model and human pons tissue; however, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT3-containing protein complexes showed increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase activity, whereas expanded AT3-containing complexes had reduced deacetylase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistently, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> analyses revealed an increased acetylation of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 in expanded AT3-expressing cells and human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expanded AT3 lost the repressor function and displayed altered DNA/chromatin binding that was not associated with recruitment of HDAC3, NCoR, and deacetylation of the promoter, allowing aberrant MMP-2 transcription via the transcription factor GATA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For transcriptional repression <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT3 cooperates with HDAC3 and requires its intact ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs), whereas aberrant transcriptional activation by expanded AT3 is independent of the UIMs but requires the catalytic cysteine of the ubiquitin protease domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT3 binds target promoter regions and represses transcription of a GATA-2-dependent target gene via formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi>-deacetylating repressor complexes requiring its UIM-associated function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expanded AT3 aberrantly activates transcription via its catalytic site and loses the ability to form deacetylating repressor complexes on target chromatin regions </plain></SENT>
