<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant types of SOD1 and ataxin-3 are degraded by the proteasome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was recently reported that these two proteins are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mammalian gp78 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that gp78 interacts with both SOD1 and ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of gp78 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of these two proteins, whereas knockdown of gp78 stabilizes them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, gp78 represses aggregate formation of mutant SOD1 and protect cells against mutant SOD1-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, gp78 is increased in cells transfected with these two mutant proteins as well as in ALS mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results suggest that gp78 functions in the regulation of SOD1 and ataxin-3 to target them for ERAD </plain></SENT>
