<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the SCAs are characterised by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002073'>progressive ataxia</z:hpo> and a variety of other features, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter is consistent with a growing body of evidence supporting a cognitive as well as motor role for the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent suggestions of cerebellar involvement in social cognition have not been extensively explored in these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The availability of definitive molecular diagnosis allows genetically defined subgroups of SCA patients, with distinct patterns of cerebellar and extracerebellar involvement, to be tested comparatively using a common battery of tests of general, social and emotional cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : Nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e>, and 6 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> were assessed using a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological instruments, encompassing domains of memory, language, visuo-spatial skills, calculation, attention and executive function, emotional processing and theory of mind (ToM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no deficits in visuo-spatial processing or calculation in either group, while individuals with naming and attentional difficulties were seen in both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deficits in memory and executive function were present in both conditions, albeit more pronounced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, both groups demonstrated consistently poor performance on ToM tests, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> attribution of social and emotional responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data support the hypothesis that the cerebellum is important for cognitive as well as motor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pattern of overlap of domain impairments provides tentative preliminary evidence that there is a cerebellar contribution to aspects of memory and executive function and ToM, and that other domains depend more on neural system outside the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings relating to ToM are relevant to the possibility of cerebellar involvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
