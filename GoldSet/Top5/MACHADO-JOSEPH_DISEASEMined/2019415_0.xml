<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A recent linkage study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040517" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="GTS">Tourette syndrome</z:e> with markers in the distal region of chromosome 2p gave a contradictory result with red-cell acid phosphatase (ACP1) compared to the nearby anonymous DNA markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A modifier gene that is suspected of leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>reduced penetrance</z:hpo> of the gene that causes the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative neurologic disorder</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> has been hypothesized to lie on chromosome 2p25 near the ACP1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040517" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="GTS">Tourette syndrome</z:e> (TS) has also been shown to have reduced sex-specific penetrance, ACP1 typings were performed on 12 families segregating TS, and pair-wise linkage analysis was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linkage was excluded for nearly 15 cM on either side of the ACP1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unpublished exclusion data from several laboratories permit exclusion of a linkage group extending from 2pter to 2p23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no support for the presence of any type of modifier of TS gene expression could be seen in these data </plain></SENT>
