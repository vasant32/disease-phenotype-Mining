<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical, genetic, and molecular characteristics of a group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients recently identified in the southernmost state of Brazil, and compare these data with studies from the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Some 62 individuals from 35 families, mostly of Azorean ancestry, had their clinical data and their MJD1 expanded regions examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The present patients had an earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, on average, than Portuguese-Azorean cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their survival, proportion of types, average anticipation, proportion of affected versus non-affected siblings, neurological signs and molecular findings are similar to those observed in patients previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 1 patients with male transmission showed worse anticipations than type 1 patients with female transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 1 had also larger CAG expansions than other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Brazilian origin seemed to affect the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also noted that there were no differences other than the neurological between types 2 or 3, since both are similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, disease duration and length of CAG repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We addressed the question of maintaining or not subtypes 2 and 3 separated, among patients with genetic and geographical backgrounds like the presented patients here </plain></SENT>
