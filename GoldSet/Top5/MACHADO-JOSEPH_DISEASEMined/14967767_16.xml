<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 17 (SCA17) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> caused by expansion of CAG/CAA trinucleotide repeats in the TATA-binding protein (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi>) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the number of triplets in patients with SCA17 in previous studies ranged from 43 to 63, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> number of trinucleotide units has been considered to be 42 or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, some healthy subjects in SCA17 pedigrees carry alleles with the same number of expanded repeats as patients with SCA17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the minimum number of CAG/CAA repeats in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> gene that causes SCA17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We amplified the region of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> gene containing the CAG/CAA repeat by means of polymerase chain reaction and performed fragment and sequence analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: The subjects included 734 patients with SCA (480 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> SCA and 254 patients with familial SCA) without CAG repeat expansions at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>, SCA2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e>, or dentatorubral-pallidolluysian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> loci, with 162 healthy subjects, 216 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson disease</z:e>, and 195 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients with SCA possessed an allele with more than 43 CAG/CAA repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the non-SCA groups, alleles with 43 to 45 repeats were seen in 3 healthy subjects and 2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 1 SCA pedigree, a patient with possible SCA17 and her healthy sister had alleles with 45 repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 34-year-old man carrying alleles with 47 and 44 repeats (47/44) had developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002073'>progressive cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo> at 25 years of age, and he exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and pyramidal signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>He was the only affected person in his pedigree, although his father and mother carried alleles with mildly expanded repeats (44/36 and 47/36, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In another pedigree, 1 patient carried a 43-repeat allele, whereas another patient had 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles, indicating that the 43-repeat allele may not be pathologic in this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that 44 CAG/CAA repeats is the minimum number required to cause SCA17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the existence of unaffected subjects with mildly expanded triplets suggests that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> gene mutation may not penetrate fully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Homozygosity of alleles with mildly expanded triplet repeats in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> gene might contribute to the pathologic phenotype </plain></SENT>
