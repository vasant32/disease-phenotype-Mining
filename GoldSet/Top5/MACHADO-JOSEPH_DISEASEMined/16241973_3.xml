<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that the prevalence of large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles correlates with the frequency of various types of SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have therefore attempted to resolve the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> in our population by investigating, within 204 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes, the frequency and nature of CAG repeats as well as two intragenic polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles with more than 33 CAG repeats were observed at a frequency of only 0.49% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas most of the expanded alleles worldwide have the CA haplotype, this was the least common (5.4%) variant observed in our study, although it was associated with a larger mean CAG repeat length (26.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We postulate that the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> in the Czech population might be explained by the lack of large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles and consequently a relatively small reservoir for aberrant CAG expansions at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> locus </plain></SENT>
