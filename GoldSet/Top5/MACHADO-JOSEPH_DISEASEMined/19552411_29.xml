<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Herein, we describe the design of high affinity ligands that bind expanded rCUG and rCAG repeat <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> expressed in myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> type 1 (DM1) and spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These ligands also inhibit, with nanomolar IC(50) values, the formation of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-protein complexes that are implicated in both disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expanded rCUG and rCAG repeats form stable <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> hairpins with regularly repeating internal loops in the stem and have deleterious effects on cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ligands that bind the repeats display a derivative of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52082">bisbenzimidazole</z:chebi> Hoechst 33258, which was identified by searching known <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-ligand interactions for ligands that bind the internal loop displayed in these hairpins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A series of 13 modularly assembled ligands with defined valencies and distances between ligand modules was synthesized to target multiple motifs in these <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most <z:chebi fb="156" ids="39214">avid</z:chebi> binder, a pentamer, binds the rCUG repeat hairpin with a K(d) of 13 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When compared to a series of related <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, the pentamer binds to rCUG repeats with 4.4- to &gt;200-fold specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the affinity of binding to rCUG repeats shows incremental gains with increasing valency, while the background binding to genomic DNA is correspondingly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Then, it was determined whether the modularly assembled ligands inhibit the recognition of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> repeats by Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) protein, the expanded-rCUG binding protein whose sequestration leads to splicing defects in DM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among several compounds with nanomolar IC(50) values, the most potent inhibitor is the pentamer, which also inhibits the formation of rCAG repeat-MBNL1 complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the binding data for the designed synthetic ligands and MBNL1 to repeating <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> shows that the synthetic ligand is 23-fold higher affinity and more specific to DM1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> than MBNL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies show that the designed ligands are cell permeable to mouse myoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, cell permeable ligands that bind repetitive <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> have been designed that exhibit higher affinity and specificity for binding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> than natural proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest a general approach to targeting <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, including those that cause <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> dominant disease </plain></SENT>
