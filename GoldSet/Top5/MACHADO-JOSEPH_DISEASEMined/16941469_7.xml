<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In primary RLS, a putative role of the dopaminergic system has been postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess dopaminergic function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>, 2, and 3, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> D(2) receptor binding potential (BP) was assessed by [(11)C]raclopride <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography in 10 SCA patients, 4 of whom suffered from RLS as demonstrated by polysomnography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BP was compared to 9 age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2 SCA patients, striatal BP was clearly reduced (&lt;2 SD below the mean of controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there were no significant group differences between SCA and controls, largely owing to a significantly higher variance of striatal BP in SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BP was negatively correlated with disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fit suggests an increased BP in early stages, followed by a moderate decline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> quantified regions (caudate, dorsal putamen, ventral striatum) presumably reflecting a progressive loss of D(2) receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RLS in SCA was not accompanied by a significant reduction of D(2) receptor availability in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This missing correlation may point to an extrastriatal origin of RLS </plain></SENT>
