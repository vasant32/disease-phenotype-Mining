<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dysfunction in generation or control of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> is associated with postural deficits in some human patients with cerebellar damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine the role of the cerebellum in <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi>, we investigated a conditional transgenic mouse of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (SCA3Tg) that has defective cerebellar Purkinje cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kinematic analyses and monitoring of electromyographic activities during quadrupedal standing showed that SCA3Tg mice exhibited greater hindlimb instability than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This instability increased during a reaching task that required postural adjustments associated with voluntary neck movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Normally, the activities of the hindlimb muscles are synchronized with those in the neck that are the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> for movement of the head in this reaching task; however, in SCA3Tg mice, activities in the hindlimbs were markedly delayed compared to the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations cannot simply be explained as a secondary outcome of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> that occurs in SCA3Tg mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> induced by immobilization of the hindlimbs, we did not find impairment of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the deficits in <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> during the reaching task in SCA3Tg mice were not due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> in the hindlimbs, but were mainly caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262404" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar degeneration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conclude that the cerebellum is critically involved in <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
