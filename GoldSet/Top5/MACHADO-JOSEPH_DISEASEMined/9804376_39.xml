<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MJD1 gene product, ataxin-3, exists in several isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We generated polyclonal antisera against an alternate carboxy terminus of ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This isoform, ataxin-3c, is expressed as a protein of approximately 42 kDa in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals but is significantly enlarged in affected patients confirming that the CAG repeat is part of the ataxin-3c isoform and is translated into a polyglutamine stretch, a feature common to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known CAG repeat disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3 like immunoreactivity was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human brain regions and peripheral organs studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In neuronal cells of control individuals, ataxin-3c was expressed cytoplasmatically and had a somatodendritic and axonal distribution </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal antibody, 2B6, directed against an internal part of the protein, barely detected these NIs implying proteolytic cleavage of ataxin-3 prior to its transport into the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings provide evidence that the alternate isoform of ataxin-3 is involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
