<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: It was the aim of this study to determine the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) patients, their spouses, and individuals at 50% risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, and second, to verify the existence of a correlation between depressive symptoms and the degree of motor incapacitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and forty-six individuals aged &gt; or =18 years were studied: 79 MJD patients (group 1), 43 spouses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients (group 2), 80 individuals at risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> (group 3), and a control group (group 4) composed of 44 patients with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following two tools were applied: the Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory and the Barthel index of physical incapacitation, both in an adapted Brazilian Portuguese version </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Moderate to severe depressive scores were found in 33.5% of patients in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> families, in 16.3% of the spouses, and in 6.3% of the individuals at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This linear reduction between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> family members was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Depressive scores were also associated with age and the female sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A direct correlation between Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory scores and motor incapacitation was found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients (r = 0.507, Pearson correlation, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the depressive symptoms in the control group with MS were higher than those found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients (59% of MS patients showed moderate to severe scores), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> did not correlate with physical incapacitation, age, or education attainment in the MS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms are rather common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients and in their spouses (caregivers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this condition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> seemed to be more reactive than primarily related to the disease process itself </plain></SENT>
