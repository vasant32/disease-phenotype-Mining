<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The protein ataxin-3 is responsible for spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> triggered when the length of a stretch of consecutive glutamines exceeds a critical threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different physiologic roles have been suggested for this protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More specifically, recent papers have shown that the highly conserved N-terminal Josephin domain of ataxin-3 binds ubiquitin and has ubiquitin hydrolase activity, thanks to a catalytic device specific to cysteine proteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This article shows that the protein also has autoproteolytic activity, sustained by the same residues responsible for the ubiquitin hydrolase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The autolytic activity was abolished when these residues, i.e. Cys14 and His119, were replaced by noncatalytic ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that pretreatment of the protein with tosyl l-phenylalanine chloromethyl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> also abolished this activity, and that this site-specific reagent covalently bound His119, findings supported by MS experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MS also allowed us to establish that the attack was aspecific, as cleavage sites were observed at the carboxyl side of apolar, acidic and polar uncharged residues, clustered in the C-terminal, unstructured domain of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the Josephin domain was preserved from attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that the autolytic activity reported here may play a role in pathogenesis, as fragments carrying expanded polyglutamines are thought to be significantly more toxic than the whole protein </plain></SENT>
