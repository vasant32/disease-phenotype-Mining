<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we performed a pathoanatomical analysis of the vestibular complex and its associated fibre tracts in four clinically diagnosed and genetically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients with the aim of providing more exact information as to the involvement of the vestibular system in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By means of unconventionally thick serial sections through the vestibular nuclei stained for lipofuscin pigment and Nissl material, we could show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five nuclei of this complex (interstitial, lateral, medial, spinal, and superior vestibular nuclei) are subject to neurodegenerative processes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, whereby examination of thick serial sections stained for myelin revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated fibre tracts (ascending tract of Deiters, juxtarestiform body, lateral and medial vestibulospinal tracts, medial longitudinal fascicle, vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve) underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and demyelinization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four of the patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reported lesions can help to explain the truncal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002172'>postural instability</z:hpo> as well as the impaired optokinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo>, vestibulo-ocular reaction, and horizontal gaze-holding present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
