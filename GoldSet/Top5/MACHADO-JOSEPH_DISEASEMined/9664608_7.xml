<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The causative mutation--an expansion of a (CAG)n on chromosome 14q32.1--can now be directly detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now report the first two cases of prenatal diagnosis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PND</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first presented as a simultaneous request for predictive testing and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PND</z:e> at 14 weeks of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Owing to time constraints, we performed a full protocol of counseling with shorter inter between sessions, while psycho-social evaluation of the other parent obstetric consults were also begun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We ensured that the couple wished termination if the fetus was a carrier, to avoid a presymptomatic test for the unborn child </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As the fetus carried an expanded allele (77 CAGs) inherited from his father, termination was performed and the couple received counselling, psychological and social support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The second case was the fetus of a carrier-mother that was diagnosed as non-carrier, also after amniocentesis </plain></SENT>
