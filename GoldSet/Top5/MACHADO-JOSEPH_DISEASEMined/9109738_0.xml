<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001258'>spastic paraplegias</z:hpo> (FSPs) are hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> with an unknown pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pure and complicated forms are currently differentiated on clinical grounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, no linkage studies in complicated FSP have been reported, and candidate genes have not been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three different gene loci responsible for pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> FSP and 1 for pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> FSP recently have been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This raises the question of whether the complicated forms may also be linked to any of these loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> FSP is allelic to any of the pure forms with defined loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Clinical characterization of a large kindred that included 4 generations and multipoint linkage analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Universitätsklinikum Charité, Humboldt-Universität Berlin, Neurologische Klinik und Poliklinik, Berlin, Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Twenty-six family members, 13 of whom were affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen members of a large family of 4 generations experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001258'>spastic paraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hypomimia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002067'>bradykinesia</z:hpo>, axial and limb <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000605'>supranuclear gaze palsy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, bladder and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002839'>sphincter disturbances</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001317'>cerebellar signs</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> were noted as additional features in some of the affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 20 years (range, 5-30 years), and the pattern of transmission was compatible with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The CAG-repeat expansions in the spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> genes were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis with the use of a panel of (AC)n <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat markers from the Généthon map demonstrated exclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 FSP loci recently mapped by linkage to pure forms of FSP on chromosomes 14q, 2p, 15q, and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Complicated FSP in this family is not linked to any of the known pure FSP loci, including the recessive one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the clinical differentiation of both forms still is of major relevance.ACKG </plain></SENT>
