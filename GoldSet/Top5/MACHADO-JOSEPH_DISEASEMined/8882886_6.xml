<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that its present world distribution could result from the spread of an original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation has been raised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this possibility we have conducted a linkage disequilibrium study of markers segregating with the MJD1 locus in a total of 64 unrelated families of different geographical origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant association was detected between the MJD1 locus and marker alleles at loci D14S280, D14S1050 and D14S81 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> affected individuals, except one Chinese family, had allele 3 (237 bp) at D14S280 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding is consistent with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect in our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, distinct haplotypes were observed in patients originating from the two Azorean islands showing the highest disease prevalence; therefore, the possible existence of more than one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation can not be excluded with the markers currently available </plain></SENT>
