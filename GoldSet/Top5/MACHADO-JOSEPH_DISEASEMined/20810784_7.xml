<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although increasing evidence indicates that protein native states are highly protected against aggregation, the specific protection mechanisms are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insight into such mechanisms can be gained through study of the relatively few proteins that aggregate under native conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3, the protein responsible for Spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3, a polyglutamine expansion disease, represents one of such examples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polyglutamine expansion is central for determining solubility and aggregation rates of ataxin-3, but these properties are profoundly modulated by its N-terminal Josephin domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This work aims at identifying the regions that promote Josephin fibrillogenesis and rationalizing the mechanisms that protect Josephin and nonexpanded ataxin-3 from aberrant aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using different biophysical techniques, aggregation propensity predictions and rational design of amino acid substitutions, we show that Josephin has an intrinsic tendency to fibrillize under native conditions and that fibrillization is promoted by two solvent-exposed patches, which are also involved in recognition of natural substrates, such as ubiquitin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, designed mutations at these patches or substrate binding significantly reduce Josephin aggregation kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results provide evidence that protein nonpathologic function can play an active role in preventing aberrant fibrillization and suggest the molecular mechanism whereby this occurs in ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
