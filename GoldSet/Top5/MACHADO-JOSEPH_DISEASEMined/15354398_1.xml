<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic potential of TCS in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>), a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> affecting the cerebellum, multiple pontine nuclei, substantia nigra, pallidum, putamen, caudate nucleus and long spinal tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 15 patients with a molecular diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy control individuals were examined with TCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echogenicity of the substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, pallidum, putamen, dentate nucleus and cerebellar white matter were determined quantitatively (substantia nigra by measuring the area of incresed echogenicity) or semiquantitatively (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = marked) on both sides and compared with the echotexture of defined brain structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the width of the lateral ventricles, the 3rd and 4th ventricle was measured in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients exhibited hyperechogenicities of the cerebellar white matter (57%), substantia nigra (40%), the dentate nucleus (54%), putamen (40%) and pallidum (40%) significantly more frequently (p &lt;0.05) than controls (20%, 13%, 9%, 0%, and 0% in the corresponding areas) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In none of the healthy individuals a marked signal increase could be observed, whereas 53% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> subjects had at least one region with marked echogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>Cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> as demonstrated by an enlarged 4th ventricle was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients whereas this structure could not be differentiated from surrounding parenchyma due to its small size in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCS is a suitable and non-invasive bed-side method to detect basal ganglia hyperechogenic lesions and posterior fossa abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
