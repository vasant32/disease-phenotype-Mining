<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In three subjects with DRPLA, who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> at over 50 years of age, the number of Purkinje cells was mildly reduced, TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex, and immunoreactivities for calbindin D28K and excitatory amino acid transporter-1 (EAAT1) were altered in the molecular layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of DRPLA showed a reduction of immunoreactivity for EAAT1 in the dentate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, augmentation of Bcl-x expression by the Purkinje cells, and increases in Trk B- and GFAP-immunopositive glial cells in the granular layer were observed in half of the cases, whereas immunoreactivity for EAAT-1 was preserved both in the cerebellar cortex and dentate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> showed TUNEL-positive granular cells in the cerebellar cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age-matched control subjects did not show TUNEL-positive cells or immunohistochemical changes in the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were neither TUNEL-positive cells nor alteration of the in situ expression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins in the dentate nucleus in either variant of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002503'>spinocerebellar degeneration</z:hpo>, although both exhibited grumose degeneration in the dentate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that latent degeneration in the cerebellar cortex may occur in DRPLA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, in addition to the dentate change, which is the cardinal feature in the neuropathology of these two diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lesion of Purkinje cells and their processes in the molecular layer associated with altered <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transport may be important in DRPLA, while the significance of the abnormalities observed in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> cases, which might be related to apoptotic mechanism, remains unclear </plain></SENT>
