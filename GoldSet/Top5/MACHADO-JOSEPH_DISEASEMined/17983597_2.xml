<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, COS7-MJD26-GFP and COS7-MJD78-GFP cells, which were stably transfected with GFP-tagged full-length <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene with either 26 or 78 glutamine repeat, were used to demonstrate that both protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of bcl-2 are decreased in the presence of expanded ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the promoter activity in COS7-MJD78-GFP cells is much higher than that in COS7-MJD26-GFP, suggesting that the decrease of bcl-2 expression may be due to defects in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 5,6-dichloro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36622">benzimidazole</z:chebi> 1-beta-D-ribofuranoside, an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> analogue to inhibit <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> synthesis, was used to estimate the bcl-2 mRNA degradation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that bcl-2 mRNA decay in COS7-MJD78-GFP cells is about 3.5-fold faster than that in COS7-MJD26-GFP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study provides evidence, for the first time, that dysfunction of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> stability resulted from the presence of mutant ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
