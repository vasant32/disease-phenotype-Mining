<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inhibiting expression of ATX3 would provide a therapeutic strategy, but indiscriminant inhibition of both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant ATX3 might lead to undesirable side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An ideal silencing agent would block expression of mutant ATX3 while leaving expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> ATX3 intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have previously observed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48021">peptide nucleic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>) conjugates targeting the expanded CAG repeat within ATX3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> block expression of both alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have now identified additional <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNAs</z:chebi> capable of inhibiting ATX3 expression that vary in length and in the nature of the conjugated <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We can also achieve potent and selective inhibition using duplex <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> containing one or more mismatches relative to the CAG repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-CAG antisense bridged nucleic acid oligonucleotides that lack a cationic domain are potent inhibitors but are not allele-selective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Allele-selective inhibitors of ATX3 expression provide insights into the mechanism of selectivity and promising <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33585">lead compounds</z:chebi> for further development and in vivo investigation </plain></SENT>
