<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> caused by an expanded glutamine repeat share the pathologic feature of intranuclear aggregates or inclusions (NI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here in cell-based studies of the spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type-3 disease protein, ataxin-3, we address two issues central to aggregation: the role of polyglutamine in recruiting proteins into NI and the role of nuclear localization in promoting aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that full-length ataxin-3 is readily recruited from the cytoplasm into NI seeded either by a pathologic ataxin-3 fragment or by a second unrelated glutamine-repeat disease protein, ataxin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experiments with green fluorescence protein/polyglutamine fusion proteins show that a glutamine repeat is sufficient to recruit an otherwise irrelevant protein into NI, and studies of human disease tissue and a Drosophila <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519606" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">transgenic model</z:e> provide evidence that specific glutamine-repeat-containing proteins, including TATA-binding protein and Eyes Absent protein, are recruited into NI in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that nuclear localization promotes aggregation: an ataxin-3 fragment containing a nonpathologic repeat of 27 glutamines forms inclusions only when targeted to the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings establish the importance of the polyglutamine domain in mediating recruitment and suggest that pathogenesis may be linked in part to the sequestering of glutamine-containing cellular proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we demonstrate that the nuclear environment may be critical for seeding polyglutamine aggregates </plain></SENT>
