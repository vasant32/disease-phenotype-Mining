<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The ACA haplotype is associated with 72% of the expanded repeats in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) worldwide and has been traced to a Portuguese ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is present in only 5% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes in the Portuguese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To trace the origin of expanded alleles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> in the Indian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed CAG repeat size determination and haplotype analysis for 9 families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and 263 unrelated chromosomes with unexpanded CAG sequences from the Indian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the expanded alleles were exclusively associated with the ACA haplotype in the Indian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this haplotype was very common in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles (40%) as compared with the Portuguese population (5%) and was significantly associated with large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles (Pearson chi(2)1 = 87.1, P&lt;.001) in the Indian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also observed a rare intermediate allele of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> with the ACA haplotype but with a CAG variant instead of CAA at the sixth position in the repeat tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overrepresentation of the ACA haplotype in large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles in India as compared with the Portuguese population suggests that the expansion-prone large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles with the ACA haplotype may have been introduced in the Portuguese population through admixture with South Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Detailed haplotype analysis of a CAG variant within the repeat tract in an intermediate allele of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> suggests a mechanism of gene conversion in the expansion </plain></SENT>
