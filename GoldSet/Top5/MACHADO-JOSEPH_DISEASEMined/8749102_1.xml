<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concerning gaze limitation, upward gaze was primarily disturbed, followed by downward gaze and abduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adduction tended to be preserved although convergence was disturbed at the early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>And, upward gaze limitation was followed by loss of oculocephalic responses (OCRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bell's phenomenon was preserved until the late stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Caloric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> was absent at the early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient showed dissociation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> and vestibulo-collic reflex in the caloric test at the early stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological examination revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> in the interstitial nucleus of Cajal and the MLF as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> in the oculomotor nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vestibular nuclei also showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of nerve cells </plain></SENT>
