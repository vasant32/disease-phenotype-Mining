<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of oropharyngeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Forty individuals participated in this study, including 20 with no clinical complaints and 20 dysphagic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> of clinical type 1, who were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> similar in terms of gender distribution, average age, and cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The medical history of each patient was reviewed and each subject underwent a clinical evaluation of deglutition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end, the profile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> was classified according to the Severity Scale of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo>, as described by O'Neil and collaborators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparison between dysphagic patients and controls did not reveal many significant differences with respect to the clinical evaluation of the oral phase of deglutition, since afflicted patients only demonstrated deficits related to the protrusion, retraction and tonus of the tongue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, several significant differences were observed with respect to the pharyngeal phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dysphagic patients presented pharyngeal stasis during deglutition of liquids and solids, accompanied by coughing and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0003298'>choking</z:mp> as well as penetration and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>; these signs were absent in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oropharyngeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> is part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> since the first neurological manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is greater involvement of the pharyngeal phase, in relation to oral phase of the deglutition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> of these patients is classified between mild and moderate </plain></SENT>
