<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of aggregates of abnormally expanded polyglutamine (polyQ)-containing proteins are a pathological hallmark of a number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) and spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies in cellular, Drosophila, and mouse models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and SCA have shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> can be prevented by manipulations that inhibit polyQ aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown that the UL97 kinase of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) prevents aggregation of the pp71 and pp65 <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> tegument proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To explore whether UL97 may act as a general antiaggregation factor, we examined whether UL97 prevents aggregation of cellular non-polyQ and polyQ proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report that UL97 prevents the deposition of aggregates of two non-polyQ proteins: a protein chimera (GFP170*) composed of the green fluorescent protein and a fragment of the Golgi <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33837">Complex protein</z:chebi> (GCP-170) and a chimera composed of the red fluorescent protein (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi>) fused to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043119" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Werner syndrome</z:e> protein (WRN), a RecQ helicase and exonuclease involved in DNA repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that UL97 inhibits aggregate deposition in cellular models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>UL97 prevents the deposition of aggregates of the mutant huntingtin exon 1 containing 82 glutamine repeats (HttExon1-Q82) or full length ataxin-3 containing a 72 polyQ track (AT3-72Q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The kinase activity of UL97 appears critical, as the kinase-dead UL97 mutant (K335M) fails to prevent aggregate formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We further show that UL97 disrupts nuclear PML bodies and decreases p53-mediated transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The universality of the antiaggregation effect of UL97 suggests that UL97 targets a key cellular factor that regulates cellular aggregation mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results identify UL97 as a novel means to modulate polyQ aggregation and suggest that UL97 can serve as a novel tool to probe the cellular mechanisms that contribute to the formation of aggregates in polyglutamine disorders </plain></SENT>
