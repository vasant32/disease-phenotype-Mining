<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such conformational diversity has complicated research into amyloid-associated intracellular dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this end, recombinant single-chain Fv antibodies (scFvs) are compelling molecular tools that can be selected against specific protein conformations, and expressed inside cells as intrabodies, for investigative and therapeutic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we report that a human scFv selected against the fibrillar form of alpha-synuclein targets isomorphic conformations of misfolded polyglutamine proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When expressed in the cytoplasm of striatal cells, this conformation-specific intrabody co-localizes with intracellular aggregates of misfolded ataxin-3 and a pathological fragment of huntingtin, and enhances the aggregation propensity of both disease-linked polyglutamine proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using this intrabody as a tool for modulating the kinetics of amyloidogenesis, we show that escalating aggregate formation of a pathologic huntingtin fragment is not cytoprotective in striatal cells, but rather heightens <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as detected by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Instead, cellular protection is achieved by suppressing aggregation using a previously described intrabody that binds to the amyloidogenic N-terminus of huntingtin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analogous cytotoxic results are observed following conformational targeting of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or polyglutamine-expanded human ataxin-3, which partially aggregate through non-polyglutamine domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings validate that the rate of aggregation modulates polyglutamine-mediated intracellular dysfunction, and caution that molecules designed to specifically hasten aggregation may be detrimental as therapies for polyglutamine disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our findings introduce a novel antibody-based tool that, as a consequence of its general specificity for fibrillar conformations and its ability to function intracellularly, offers broad research potential for a variety of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002726" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amyloid diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
