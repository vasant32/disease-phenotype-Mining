<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine ocular changes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002503'>spinocerebellar degeneration</z:hpo> who have repeated trinucleotide expansion in the spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Ophthalmic findings in 6 patients from 3 families whose DNA analysis revealed that they had an expanded allele of the trinucleotide repeated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> gene were compared with those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects and other healthy family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes of the neurodegenerative family and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Visual acuity gradually decreased in successive follow-up visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Color vision and visual fields were gradually affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electroretinograms showed mild attenuation of oscillatory potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Corneal endothelial cell density was severely decreased from 600 to 1300 cells/mm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings were not observed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects, other healthy family members, or other patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002503'>spinocerebellar degeneration</z:hpo> who had repeated trinucleotide expansion of other genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the association between ocular changes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002503'>spinocerebellar degeneration</z:hpo> and gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These ocular changes were considered specific to patients who had the expanded allele of the repeated trinucleotide in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> gene </plain></SENT>
