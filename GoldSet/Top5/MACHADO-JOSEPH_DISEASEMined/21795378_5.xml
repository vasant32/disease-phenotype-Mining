<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mutant <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> sequesters the muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) splicing factor and causes misregulation of the alternative splicing of multiple genes that are linked to clinical symptoms of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that either long untranslated CAG repeat <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> or short synthetic CAG repeats induce splicing aberrations typical of DM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alternative splicing defects are also caused by translated CAG repeats in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells transfected with a mutant ATXN3 gene construct and in cells derived from spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Splicing misregulation is unlikely to be caused by traces of antisense transcripts with CUG repeats, and the possible trigger of this misregulation may be sequestration of the MBNL1 protein with nuclear <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> inclusions containing expanded CAG repeat transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose that alternative splicing misregulation by mutant CAG repeats may contribute to the pathological features of polyglutamine disorders </plain></SENT>
