<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering that mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene have been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson disease</z:e>, we investigated whether these would be more prevalent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients with parkinsonian manifestations than in those without them </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The GBA gene was sequenced and, in a subset of patients and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers, GBA enzyme activity was measured </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, GBA sequence variations were found in 3/9 MJD/SCA3 index cases with parkinsonian manifestations (33%) and in 0/40 MJD/SCA3 controls without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> (p=0.03, Fisher exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GBA sequence variations found were p.K(-27)R, p.E326K, and p.T369M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter two sequence variations were also found in two symptomatic relatives with no parkinsonian manifestations </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sequence variations at the GBA gene may play a role as a minor, modifying gene of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
