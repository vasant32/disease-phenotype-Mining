<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An increase in CAG trinucleotide repeat length in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor (AR) gene has been linked to idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000027'>azoospermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In order to test whether other (CAG/CTG)(n) loci are also affected, the (CAG/CTG)(n) frequency distribution at myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> type 1 (DM1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (DRPLA) and spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 8 (SCA8) loci, in addition to the AR gene, was investigated in 48 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000027'>azoospermia</z:hpo> patients and 47 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median CAG repeat length in the AR gene was significantly longer in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000027'>azoospermia</z:hpo> patients than in controls (23 versus 21, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were also noted in the upper tails of trinucleotide repeat length distributions at both DM1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> loci between the two populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the DM1 locus, alleles of more than 18 repeats were observed only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000027'>azoospermia</z:hpo> patients, and not in controls (P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> locus, the frequency of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles (ANs) with 29 or more CAG repeats was also much higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000027'>azoospermia</z:hpo> patients (29.2 versus 7.4%; P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the repeat length distribution at DRPLA and SCA8 loci did not differ in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicated that, at least in a subset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000027'>azoospermia</z:hpo> patients, there was an increase in the number of trinucleotide repeats in some disease loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is noteworthy to evaluate whether offspring of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0000027'>azoospermia</z:hpo> patients, if born by assisted reproductive technologies, have an increased risk of trinucleotide repeat diseases </plain></SENT>
