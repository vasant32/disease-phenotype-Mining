<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore it is important to characterize specific clinical-neuropathologic phenotypes as precisely as possible at the genetic level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a family with dominantly inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> with relatively "pure" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001317'>cerebellar signs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropathologic examination in two individuals from this family revealed findings consistent with cerebello-olivary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, suggesting that this neuropathologic phenotype many run true within f families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations at the spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-I, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>, and dentatorubropallidoluysian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> loci were excluded by direct DNA analysis on the leukocytes of one living affected member </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus we provide evidence that these mutations are not responsible for this particular phenotype of dominantly inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
