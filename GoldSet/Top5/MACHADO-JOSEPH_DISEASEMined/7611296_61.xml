<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) is associated with the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in a novel gene on 14q32.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We confirmed the presence of this expansion in 156 MJD patients from 33 families of different geographic origins: 15 Portuguese Azorean, 2 Brazilian, and 16 North American of Portuguese Azorean descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> chromosomes contain between 12 and 37 CAG repeats in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene carriers have alleles within the expanded range of 62-84 CAG units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of expanded alleles and the gap between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and expanded allele sizes is either inconsistent with a premutation hypothesis or most (if not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) of the alleles we studied descend from a common ancestor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is a strong correlation between the expanded repeat size and the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease as well as the clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is mild instability of the CAG tract length with transmission of the expanded alleles; both increase and decrease in size between parents and progeny occur, with larger variations in male than in female transmissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, these effects can partly explain the variability of age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and of phenotypic features in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>; however, other modifying factors must exist </plain></SENT>
