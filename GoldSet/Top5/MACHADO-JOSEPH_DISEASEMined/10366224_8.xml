<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients belonged to the ADCA type I group (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>, 12; SCA2, 10; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, 13) and five to the ADCA type II group </plain></SENT>
