<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, in studies of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3, also known as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>), we show that the disease protein ataxin-3 accumulates in ubiquitinated intranuclear inclusions selectively in neurons of affected brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We further provide evidence in vitro for a model of disease in which an expanded polyglutamine-containing fragment recruits full-length protein into insoluble aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Together with recent findings from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519606" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">transgenic models</z:e>, our results suggest that intranuclear aggregation of the expanded protein is a unifying feature of CAG/polyglutamine diseases and may be initiated or catalyzed by a glutamine-containing fragment of the disease protein </plain></SENT>
