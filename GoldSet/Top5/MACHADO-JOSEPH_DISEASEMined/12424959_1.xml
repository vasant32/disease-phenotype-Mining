<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore careful pre- and post-test genetic counseling and psychosocial support should be provided along with such genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Division of Clinical and Molecular Genetics was established at our hospital in May 1996 to provide skilled professional genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since its establishment, 14 individuals have visited our clinic to request predictive genetic testing for hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular diseases</z:e> (4 for myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, 6 for spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, 3 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e>, and 1 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main reasons for considering testing were to remove uncertainty about the genetic status and to plan for the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of 14 individuals requested testing for making decisions about a forthcoming marriage or pregnancy (family planning) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other reasons raised by the individuals included career or financial planning, planning for their own health care, and knowing the risk for their children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the first genetic counseling session, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the individuals expressed hopes of not being a gene carrier and of escaping from fear of disease, and seemed not to be mentally well prepared for an increased-risk result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To date, 7 of the 14 individuals have received genetic testing and only one, who underwent predictive genetic testing for spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, was given an increased-risk result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The seven individuals including the one with an increased-risk result, have coped well with their new knowledge about their genetic status after the testing results were disclosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of them has expressed regret </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In pre-test genetic counseling sessions, we consider it quite important not only to determine the psychological status of the individual, but also to make the individual try to anticipate the changes in his/her life upon receiving an increased-risk or a decreased-risk result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sufficient time should be taken to build a good relationship between the individual and his/her family and the medical staff during pre-test counseling sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This will help the individuals feel satisfied with their own decisions for the future, whether they receive genetic testing or not </plain></SENT>
