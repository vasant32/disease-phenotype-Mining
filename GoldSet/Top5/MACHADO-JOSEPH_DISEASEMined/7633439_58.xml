<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CAG expansions of the MJD1 gene was identified as the cause of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed 90 MJD individuals from 62 independent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> families and found that the MJD1 repeat length is inversely correlated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> (r = -0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> chromosomes contained 61-84 repeat units, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes displayed 14-34 repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes, 14 repeat units were the most common and the shortest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In association with the clinical anticipation of the disease, a parent--child analysis showed the unidirectional expansion of CAG repeats and no case of diminution in the affected family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The differences in CAG repeat length between parent and child and between siblings are greater in paternal transmission than in maternal transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Detailed analysis revealed that a large degree of expansion was associated with a shorter length of MJD1 gene in paternal transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the increments of increase were similar for shorter and longer expansion in maternal transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the three clinical subtypes, type I of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo>, showed a larger degree of expansion in CAG repeats of the gene and younger <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>ages of onset</z:hpo> than the other types </plain></SENT>
