<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to perform an automated and a manual segmentation of the thalamus in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the MarsBar volume of interest analysis toolbox to SPM2 and selected thalamic region of interests and we performed a t-test with Bonferroni's correction using SPM2 to compare patients to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Next, we performed manual segmentation of the thalamus using the display software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences between patients and controls were analyzed by t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also correlated manual thalamic volumes with clinical and genetic markers of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed decreased thalamic volumes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> when compared to controls using both methods of volumetric measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> had smaller volumes than patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed thalamic involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> had smaller thalamic volumes than patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We observed a clinical-anatomical correlation, which suggests that different phenotypes of the disease present different primary or secondary targets of the disease </plain></SENT>
