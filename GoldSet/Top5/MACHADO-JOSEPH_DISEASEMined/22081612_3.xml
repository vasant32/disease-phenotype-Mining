<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported previously that parkin, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson disease</z:e>-associated E3 ubiquitin-ligase interacts with ataxin-3, a deubiquitinating enzyme associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3 was found to counteract parkin self-ubiquitination both in vitro and in cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ataxin-3-dependent deubiquitination of parkin required the catalytic cysteine 14 in ataxin-3, although the precise mechanism remained unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here that ataxin-3 interferes with the attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) onto parkin in real-time during conjugation but is unable to hydrolyze previously assembled parkin-Ub conjugates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mechanism involves an ataxin-3-dependent stabilization of the complex between parkin and the E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme, which impedes the efficient charging of the E2 with Ub </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, within this complex, the transfer of Ub from the E2 is diverted away from parkin and onto ataxin-3, further explaining how ataxin-3 deubiquitination is coupled to parkin ubiquitination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our findings reveal an unexpected convergence upon the E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme in the regulation of an E3/deubiquitinating enzyme pair, with important implications for the function of parkin and ataxin-3, two proteins responsible for closely related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
