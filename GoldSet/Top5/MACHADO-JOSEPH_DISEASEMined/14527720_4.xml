<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the hMJD gene was identified in two overlapping <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and contained 11 exons resulting in a 6.14 kb transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 5'-flanking region of the hMJD gene included a TATA-less promoter with GC-rich regions, a CCAAT box and multiple potential SP1 binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Luciferase reporter assays performed in neuronal and non-neuronal human cell lines demonstrated a core promoter within the 200 bp region immediately upstream of the putative transcriptional start site (-89 according to the start codon) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA-protein interactions defined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) revealed specific binding of nuclear proteins to the putative core promoter region </plain></SENT>
