<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the clinical, radiological, and autopsy findings of one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patient and then retrospectively reviewed the MRI images of another 15 patients looking for a similar abnormal signal intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The significance of the clinicoradiological correlation of the MRI finding was confirmed by examining the MRI images of 130 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the autopsy case, abnormal linear high intensity areas were observed along the bilateral medial margins of the internal segments of the GPi on T2 weighted, FLAIR, and proton density images, but not on T1 weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathologically, this abnormal signal intensity was consistent with degeneration of the LF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same finding was also observed in the other 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two patients the finding was only unilaterally observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No control subject showed this MRI finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients, abnormal linear high intensity areas indicating LF degeneration are usually observed along the medial margin of the GPi on T2 weighted, FLAIR, and proton density sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this MRI finding has not previously been described </plain></SENT>
