<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still unclear how the nature of the expansion and the protein context influence the tendency of a protein to aggregate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have addressed these questions using spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type-3 (ATX3) protein, the best characterised of the polyglutamine proteins, chosen as a model system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a transfected mammalian cell line, we demonstrate that ATX3 aggregation is noticeably reduced by deletion or replacement of regions other than the polyglutamine tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nature of the amino acid homo-sequences also has a strong influence on aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From our studies, we draw general conclusions on the effect of the protein architecture and of the amino acid homo-sequence on pathology </plain></SENT>
