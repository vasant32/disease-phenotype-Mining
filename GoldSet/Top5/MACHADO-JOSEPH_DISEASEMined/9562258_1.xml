<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the relationship between the number of CAG repeat units in the MJD1 gene and clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) in eight patients from two generations of a Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of lack of characteristic clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002750'>bulging eyes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000317'>facial myokymia</z:hpo>, clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> in this family was difficult to make prior to molecular testing for the CAG repeat expansion in the MJD1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients exhibited maternal transmission of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, and the intergenerational change in the number of CAG repeat units in the MJD1 gene was very small (+0.5+/-0.3, mean+/-S.E.M., n=4) in spite of marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0003743'>genetic anticipation</z:hpo> (-17.0 years/generation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present family, the degree of anticipation per repeat unit in maternal transmissions was much larger than that in maternal transmissions in the other six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This indicates that some maternal factors other than the increase of the number of CAG repeat units, which is known to be the basis of anticipation, may play a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003743'>genetic anticipation</z:hpo> in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> family </plain></SENT>
