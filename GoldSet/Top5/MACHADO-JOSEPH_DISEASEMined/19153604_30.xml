<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regulation of the activity of DUBs, which is critically important to cellular homoeostasis, can be achieved at the level of gene expression, protein complex formation, or degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that ubiquitination also directly regulates the activity of a DUB, ataxin-3, a polyglutamine disease protein implicated in protein quality control pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitination enhances ubiquitin (Ub) chain cleavage by ataxin-3, but does not alter its preference for K63-linked Ub chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cells, ubiquitination of endogenous ataxin-3 increases when the proteasome is inhibited, when excess Ub is present, or when the unfolded protein response is induced, suggesting that the cellular functions of ataxin-3 in protein quality control are modulated through ubiquitination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3 is the first reported DUB in which ubiquitination directly regulates catalytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose a new function for protein ubiquitination in regulating the activity of certain DUBs and perhaps other enzymes </plain></SENT>
