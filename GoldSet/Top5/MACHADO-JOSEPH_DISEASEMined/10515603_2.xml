<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to assess the role of the tract, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids that contain various lengths of CAG repeat encoding polyglutamine without the repeat disorder proteins: (CAG)27, (CAG)40, (CAG)80, (CAG)130, and (CAG)180 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Except for (CAG)27, and (CAG)40, 293T cells showed a common set of morphological alterations such as shrinkage, rounding and surface blebbing when the expanded stretch was expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, nuclear staining experiments showed chromatin condensation in COS-7 cells transfected with the vectors containing expanded CAG repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that expanded polyglutamine itself is able to induce cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, suggesting existence of a common molecular mechanism in the etiology of neurodegenerative polyglutamine diseases </plain></SENT>
