<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By the discriminant formula based on size of the cerebellar vermis and ventral pons, which was reported in our previous study, the patients were classified into three types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 1 included the cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophies</z:mpath> in the vermis and pons; OPCA type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 2 showed vermian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and less significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in pons; LCCA type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And Group 3 was no significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophies</z:mpath> both in vermis and pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases in Group 1 were furthermore divided into two groups according to width of the midbrain tegmentum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group 1A, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> midbrain tegmentum, was consisted of five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four cases were diagnosed as Menzel type OPCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another case showed various clinical symptoms and relatively mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophies</z:mpath> for his duration of illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>His family members were classified to Group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven cases in Group 1B showed reduced midbrain tegmentum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four cases showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo>, ocular symptoms, bladder dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>amyotrophy</z:hpo> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002380'>fasciculation</z:hpo>, and they seemed to be a special type of SCD mimicking <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Their MRI demonstrated severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophies</z:mpath> in the cerebellum, pons and afferent cerebellar peduncli, and this pedigree was thought to be Menzel type OPCA with various associated disorders </plain></SENT>
