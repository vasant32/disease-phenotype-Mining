<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>24 patients with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 6 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e>), type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>), and Friedreich's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (FRDA) participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> affects primarily the cerebellum, whereas extracerebellar involvement is common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> and FRDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Testing was performed in three sessions six months apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> was defined based on the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> Cooperative Rating Scale (ICARS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As expected, cerebellar patients were significantly impaired in eyeblink conditioning compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Signs of retention and further learning across sessions were present in controls, but not in the cerebellar patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, findings of disturbed timing of conditioned responses were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onsets</z:hpo> and peaks of the conditioned responses (CRs) occurred significantly earlier in cerebellar patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Shortened CR responses were most prominent in patients with primarily cerebellar cortical disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cerebellar patients, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> and the FRDA group correlations between learning deficits and clinical findings were weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moderate-to-strong correlations were found in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change, however, in clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> scores and CR incidence across the three sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In summary, impaired learning of conditioned eyeblink responses is a stable finding across multiple sessions in patients with degenerative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eyeblink conditioning may be a useful measure of cerebellar impairment in patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo> that primarily affect the cerebellum (such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In other heredoataxias (such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> and FRDA), extracerebellar involvement not assessed by ICARS likely contributes to eyeblink conditioning abnormalities </plain></SENT>
