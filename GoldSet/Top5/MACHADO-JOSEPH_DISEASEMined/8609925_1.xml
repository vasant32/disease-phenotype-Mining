<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five had an expanded trinucleotide (CAG) repeat sequence in the MJD1 gene on chromosome 14 indicating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, while 3 unaffected individuals had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> repeat lengths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three individuals with repeat expansion had clinical symptoms and signs of the Machado or "type III" phenotype, whereas 2 had slight symptoms and signs only, Electrophysiological evaluation included visual, somatosensory, and auditory brain stem evoked potentials, quantitative electromyography, and nerve conduction studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients with clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, evoked potential studies showed multimodal abnormalities, electromyography showed neurogenic changes, and nerve conduction studies showed signs of severe loss of motor and sensory nerve fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 2 patients with slight symptoms and signs, 1 had evidence of peripheral and central affection, while the other had slight signs of a central affection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study provides insight into the distribution and character of electrophysiological abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> of putative importance for an understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, and for monitoring disease progress, or the outcome of a possible treatment </plain></SENT>
