<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) is a dominantly inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There has been no report of electrophysiological or histological alterations of the peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> were identified by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The peripheral nerves of these patients were subjected to electrophysiological testing and histological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlation analyses were made between various clinical parameters and the electrophysiological and histological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Electrophysiological studies demonstrated a marked reduction of sensory action potential, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> denervation changes on needle EMG, as well as mild decrease in the compound motor action potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy of the sural nerves revealed clear <z:hpo ids='HP_0003380'>loss of myelinated fibers</z:hpo>, and morphometry studies showed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003387'>loss of large myelinated fibers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the severity of these pathological changes was found to be related to the CAG repeat length in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that the peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system was frequently affected in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings were similar to those seen in Friedreich's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, suggesting a loss of sensory and motor fibers probably following a lesion of the dorsal root ganglion and the anterior horns in the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the number of CAG repeats seems to have an inverse relationship to the extent of pathological changes of the peripheral nerves </plain></SENT>
