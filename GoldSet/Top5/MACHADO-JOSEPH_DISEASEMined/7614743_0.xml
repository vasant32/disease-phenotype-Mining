<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Though absolute rCBF in the cerebellar hemisphere and pons was significantly low in each of 2 subgroups of SCD compared to the control group, no difference was seen between 2 subgroups of SCD in these regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, absolute rCBF in the cerebral cortices did not show significant difference among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, when the rCBF data was normalized to the occipital cortex for relative rCBF, in the patient group with Menzel type, relative rCBF in the thalamus was significantly low value compared to the control group and relative rCBF in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex, especially in the frontal, was significantly low value compared to the patient group with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, clinically <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> were seen in patients of Menzel type, but not in patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the measurement of rCBF by PET is useful for the understanding of the pathophysiology of hereditary SCD subgroups as well as for the differential diagnosis of these diseases </plain></SENT>
