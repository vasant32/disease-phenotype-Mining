<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The spinocerebellar system including Clarke's column and the spinocerebellar tracts were degenerated, but the cerebellar cortex and inferior olivary nucleus were spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Slight-to-moderate degeneration was observed in the pontocerebellar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the dentate nucleus, most of the neurons showed what is known in Japan as "grumose degeneration", but there was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The hilus of the dentate nucleus and the superior cerebellar peduncle were intact.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
