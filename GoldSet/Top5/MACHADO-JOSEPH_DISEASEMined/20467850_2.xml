<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to describe the progression of neurological manifestations in a long-term cohort of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> 3, and to verify if CAG expanded repeat, gender, and age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were associated with the rate of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients entered the study between 1998 and 2005 and were seen until 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On each visit, the validated NESSCA scale, an inventory of 18 neurological manifestations, was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scores observed in each year of disease duration produced a Growth Curve, which was analyzed through the random coefficients model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Scores obtained in some individual items were described through multi-state Markov models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifty-six patients (78 families) were recruited; 28 were lost, and 23 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean (sd) ages at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and at baseline were 32.8 (10.6) and 40.7 (12.8) years; median (range) expanded CAGn was 74 (67-85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three hundred fifteen NESSCA evaluations were performed, comprising disease durations from zero to 34 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 105 patients who completed the study were seen over 5 (sd = 2.4) years at intervals of 2.5 (sd = 1.5) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The trajectory of NESSCA obtained for the overall group increased by 1.26 points per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This slope increased by 0.15 points per each additional CAG in the expanded repeat (p &lt; 0.0002) and decreased by 0.03 points per each additional year of age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NESSCA worsened steadily, producing linear trajectories, which were faster among patients with longer expanded repeats (&gt;74) and with lower ages at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (&lt;34 years) </plain></SENT>
