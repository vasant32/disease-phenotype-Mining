<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Texture analysis (TA) is a branch of image processing, which attempts to convey "texture" information from digital images, such as magnetic resonance images (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) affects mainly cerebellum and brainstem, but recent studies have shown that other cerebral structures may also be affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate subtle structural abnormalities in corpus callosum (CC), thalami, putamen, and caudate nuclei of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> using TA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen healthy volunteers and 18 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> were studied (mean age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> = 34.7 years; disease duration = 9.6 years; mean expanded CAG in the MJD1 gene = 73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A TA approach based on the gray-level cooccurrence matrix was applied to T1-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regions of interest were manually segmented for each subject, and texture parameters were computed for each of the aforementioned anatomical structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TA parameters showed differences between the 2 groups for the caudate nuclei, thalami, and putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were found for the CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TA was capable of detecting tissue alterations in MRI of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These alterations were in areas already shown to be affected by histopathological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, we confirmed the thalamic involvement in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, which had only been demonstrated in volumetric studies </plain></SENT>
