<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis revealed a dramatic differential expression of carbonic anhydrase-related protein XI (CA-RPXI/CA11) in the presence or absence of mutant ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the expression and distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three CA-RPs (CA8, 10, and 11) in human neuronal cells that stably express mutant ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with the cells containing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ataxin-3, protein expression of CA8 and CA11 is significantly increased in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells harboring mutant ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Semi-quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three CA-RPs exhibited significantly higher transcript levels in neuronal cells expressing mutant ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, CA11 is distributed not only in the cytoplasm but also within the nuclei of the stably transfected mutant cells when compared with the sole cytoplasmic distribution in cells containing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, results from transient transfection assays in SK-N-SH and Neuro2a (N2a) cells also confirmed the nuclear localization of CA11 in the presence of truncated ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, immunohistochemical staining of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> transgenic mouse and post-mortem <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> human brain also revealed that CA11 is highly expressed in both cytoplasm and nuclei of the brain cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recruitment of CA11 into nuclear inclusions containing mutant ataxin-3 revealed a possible correlation between CA11 and disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the exact function of CA-RPs is still undefined in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, our findings suggest that CA-RPs, especially CA11, may play specific roles in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
