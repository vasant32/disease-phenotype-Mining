<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the potential use of S100B and NSE serum concentrations as peripheral markers of symptomatic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured S100B and NSE peripheral concentrations of 22 MJD patients and compared with healthy subjects concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlations of both markers with CAG repeat size, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, disease duration, and the scores of the Extended Disability Status Scale of Kurtzke, Unified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's Disease</z:e> Rating Scale, and the Montgomery-Asberg <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> rating scale were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: S100B serum concentrations between control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> subjects were not statistically different, whereas NSE serum concentrations were higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients than in control subjects (p=0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>S100B presented a moderate correlation with disease duration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> score, whereas NSE presented a moderate correlation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> score and a good negative correlation with EDSS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients present increased concentrations of NSE and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> concentrations of S100B in blood </plain></SENT>
