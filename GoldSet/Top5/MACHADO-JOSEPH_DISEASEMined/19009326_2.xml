<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A head-up tilt (HUT) test involving the monitoring of blood pressure, HR, and cerebral oxy/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration was also performed in each participant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in HR variability at rest between the two groups, but the transient HR rise just after standing suddenly in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> group was significantly less than that in the control group (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HUT test, where each participant was gradually tilted upward, induced a significantly greater HR increase in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> group compared with the controls (p &lt; 0.01), while there were no significant differences in the blood pressure and cerebral oxygenation changes between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> study, the transient HR rise just after standing suddenly was diminished, and HR markedly increased during sustained orthostatic stress </plain></SENT>
