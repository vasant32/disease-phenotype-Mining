<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with very mild symptoms (formes frustes) were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expansion of the CAG repeat at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> locus ranged from 64 to 71 in 7 affected and 4 presymptomatic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our family, no clear inverse correlation was noted between the length of CAG-expansion and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, or the clinical phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001265'>Hyporeflexia</z:hpo> was a common manifestation seen in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> is associated with smaller increase in the CAG repeats; findings in our family conform with this observation </plain></SENT>
