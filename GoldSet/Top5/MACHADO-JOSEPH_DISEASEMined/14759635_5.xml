<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> has not been fully delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated LUT dysfunction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> by clinical-urodynamic observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 24 genetically diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, we recruited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 patients with LUT symptoms (six men, five women; age, 18-61 [mean 48] years; disease duration, 2-24 [mean 9] years; voiding difficulty, 7, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo>, 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Urodynamic studies consisted of uroflowmetry, measurement of post-void residuals and electromyography (EMG)-cystometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurophysiology tests consisted of motor unit potential (MUP) analysis of the sphincter and extremity muscles, tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) and nerve conduction studies (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>) of the extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Urodynamic abnormalities were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximum or average flow rate was decreased in five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post-void residual was noted in three but residual urine volume &gt; 100 ml was noted in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Maximum urethral closure pressure was low in one and high in one of five patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EMG-cystometry during filling showed detrusor overactivity in five, impaired bladder sensation in four, low compliance detrusor in one, uninhibited sphincter relaxation in one and incompetent urethra in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Voiding phase abnormalities included detrusor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001284'>areflexia</z:hpo> in three and detrusor-sphincter <z:hpo ids='HP_0010867'>dyssynergia</z:hpo> in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Bethanechol supersensitivity of the bladder was noted in one of three patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Bulbocavernosus reflex was absent in two of five patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>MUP analysis showed neurogenic changes in six of nine sphincter muscles and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six extremity muscles studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Five patients had prolonged or absent cortical response in SEP and four had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003390'>sensory axonal neuropathy</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>, which were relevant to the impaired bladder sensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the present study, a half of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients had LUT symptoms and they showed various urodynamic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Detrusor overactivity, impaired bladder sensation, and neurogenic sphincter EMG were common findings, and large post-void residuals were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These findings are relevant to central and peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system pathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
