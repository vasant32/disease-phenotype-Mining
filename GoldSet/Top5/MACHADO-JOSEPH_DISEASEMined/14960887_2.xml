<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A better understanding of human genetic variation is important in assessing disease epidemiology and phenotypic variation, and may be critical in evaluating genetic aspects of common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>, bipolar disease and Parkinson's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These diseases are particularly difficult to investigate as there are few peripheral markers, and although a genetic aetiology has long been suspected, robust findings have been hard to establish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Variations in alleles at 13 tri-nucleotide gene loci expressed in the brain and implicated in several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, as well as certain other loci, were examined in the Indian population for comparison with other major ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In the Indian population, the distribution of alleles at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> locus was similar to the Western European pattern of distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of haplotypes at the locus for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> suggested multiple origins, and possible effects of population admixture because of the recent history of the country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At other alleles of neuropsychiatric interest (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> receptor, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> receptor, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> transporter, alcohol dehydrogenase), allele frequencies in the Indian population differed from other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interspecies comparison suggests a gradual expansion in repeat size, with the exception of the CLOCK gene, which displays a contraction of CAG repeat numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>World-wide differences in disease phenotypes need to be explored, and an appreciation of their genetic basis may provide a window of opportunity for improving our knowledge of the underlying genetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
