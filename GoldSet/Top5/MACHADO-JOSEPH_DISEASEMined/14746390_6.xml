<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY OBJECTIVES: A relatively high prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035258" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">restless legs syndrome</z:e> symptoms has been recently reported in a substantial proportion of patients affected with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate whether there is a common genetic etiology between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035258" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">restless legs syndrome</z:e> and spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Systematic differences in the number of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 trinucleotide repeat were investigated by means of an association study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the size of the expanded alleles and several clinical features was also considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 125 extensively characterized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035258" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">restless legs syndrome</z:e> patients compared with 188 healthy controls matched for ethnic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: N/A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: No CAG repeat expansions in the pathologic or intermediate range were detected in any of the examined subjects, including patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar allelic distribution was observed in both groups (Mann-Whitney U test = 78406; P = 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, stratification analyses of the patients' samples according to different clinical and polysomnographic variables disclosed no significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results do not provide evidence toward an involvement of large CAG trinucleotide expansions at the spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 locus in idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035258" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">restless legs syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
