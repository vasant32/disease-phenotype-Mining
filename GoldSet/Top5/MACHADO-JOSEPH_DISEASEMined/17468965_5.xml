<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine patients with SCA2, 12 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, seven with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e>, and 23 healthy control subjects were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical severity of the patients' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> was evaluated according to the International Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> Rating Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism was evaluated with 2- [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">fluorine 18</z:chebi>]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FDG) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group data were analyzed and compared by voxelbased analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In SCA2, FDG utilization was significantly reduced in the cerebellum, pons, parahippocampal gyrus and frontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, FDG metabolism in the cerebellum, parahippocampal gyrus of the limbic system, and lentiform nucleus was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e>, FDG metabolism was diminished in the cerebellum and the frontal and prefrontal cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On group comparisons, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SCAs have impaired cerebellar functions, the cerebellar FDG metabolism was most severely compromised in SCA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Instead, the FDG metabolism in the lentiform nucleus and medulla was characteristically worst in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no brainstem involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> </plain></SENT>
