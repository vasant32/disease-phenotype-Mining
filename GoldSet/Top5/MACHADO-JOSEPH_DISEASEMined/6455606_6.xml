<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two major classes of proteins, one with a MW of 50,000 probably representing the glial filamentous acidic protein, or another class with a MW of 40,000 (proteins Jc, Jd, L1 and L2) were increased in the cerebellum of six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same protein species were abnormally increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> brains, mainly in the basal ganglia and frontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These identical classes of protein changes were present in two nosologically separate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> (a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002503'>spinocerebellar degeneration</z:hpo>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> (a basal ganglia and cerebral cortical degeneration) and may reflect a biochemical correlation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> and neuronal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, these changes may be evidence that the two diseases are allelic mutations of the same gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dominantly inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002503'>spinocerebellar degenerations</z:hpo> may result from a primary deficit of glial-neuronal interaction, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> but with a compensatory increase in the number of glial cells attempting to provide additional trophic-metabolic support </plain></SENT>
