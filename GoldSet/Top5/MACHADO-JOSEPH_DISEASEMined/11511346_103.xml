<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>De novo formation of [PSI(+)] requires an additional non-Mendelian trait, thought to result from a prion form of one or more unknown proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We find that the Gln/Asn-rich prion domains of two proteins, New1p and Rnq1p, can control susceptibility to [PSI(+)] induction as well as enhance aggregation of a human glutamine expansion disease protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>[PSI(+)] inducibility results from gain-of-function properties of New1p and Rnq1p aggregates rather than from inactivation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest a molecular basis for the epigenetic control of [PSI(+)] inducibility and may reveal a broader role for this phenomenon in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of protein aggregation </plain></SENT>
