<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) is a type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> for which molecular diagnosis is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified 4 families segregating the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> mutation in which no unequivocal clinical diagnosis could be established prior to molecular testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ethnic background, clinical, and molecular characteristics of 19 individuals carrying the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> mutation in these 4 families were compared with a group of 32 Portuguese families who were clinically diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and were found to carry the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Several factors seemed to have an impact in the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis, such as ethnic origin; the number of affected individuals available for examination in each family; the absence of patients showing specific clinical features, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal signs</z:hpo>; and the size of the expanded CAG repeat in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Since the recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> based solely on clinical grounds might sometimes be misleading, a search for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> mutation should be performed in patients with a clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002503'>spinocerebellar degeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
