<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we present two lines of evidence implicating the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, studies of both human disease tissue and in vitro models showed redistribution of the 26S proteasome complex into polyglutamine aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In neurons from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> brain, the proteasome localized to intranuclear inclusions containing the mutant protein, ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In transfected cells, the proteasome redistributed into inclusions formed by three expanded polyglutamine proteins: a pathologic ataxin-3 fragment, full-length mutant ataxin-3 and an unrelated GFP-polyglutamine fusion protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inclusion formation by the full-length mutant ataxin-3 required nuclear localization of the protein and occurred within specific subnuclear structures recently implicated in the regulation of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> antigen oncogenic domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a second set of experiments, inhibitors of the proteasome caused a repeat length-dependent increase in aggregate formation, implying that the proteasome plays a direct role in suppressing polyglutamine aggregation in disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results support a central role for protein misfolding in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and suggest that modulating proteasome activity is a potential approach to altering the progression of this and other polyglutamine diseases </plain></SENT>
