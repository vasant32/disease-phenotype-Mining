<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient became affected at the age of 50 years and presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002073'>cerebellar ataxia, progressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000544'>external ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscular atrophy</z:hpo>, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal signs</z:hpo> were never detected throughout the whole course of his disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His mother, sister and son presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002073'>progressive ataxia</z:hpo> in the third or fourth decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> is considered to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathological examination revealed severe involvement of the dentato-rubral, ponto-cerebellar and subthalamopallidal systems, spinocerebellar tracts and Clarke's column, cranial motor nuclei including the oculomotor systems and anterior horn cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The involvement of the substantia nigra was relatively mild, and the nerve cells in the inferior olivary nucleus were well preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distal portion of peripheral nerves was severely damaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the striking feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> is a considerable variability in the individual clinical expression, there have not been many autopsied cases of this disease and efforts to clarify the clinico-pathological correlation in each phenotype have scarcely been made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relatively mild changes in the substantia nigra and severe involvement of the peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, as in our case, may be the pathological hallmarks of the type III disorder </plain></SENT>
