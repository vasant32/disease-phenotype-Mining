<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with the cerebellar variant of multiple system <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (MSA-C), 7 patients with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type-3 (SCA-3), 3 patients with SCA-6, and 13 healthy age-matched volunteers participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain AChE activity was measured by [(11)C] N-methylpiperidin-4-yl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17272">propionate</z:chebi> PET in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain AChE activities were significantly decreased in the thalamus (-27%) and the posterior lobe of cerebellar cortex (-36%) in patients with MSA-C and in the thalamus (-23%) in patients with SCA-3 compared with healthy controls (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thalamic AChE activities of SCA-3 patients were negatively correlated with the unified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> rating scale motor subscore (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AChE activities were not significantly altered in the cerebral cortex in any disease group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduction of AChE activities in the thalamus and cerebellum in MSA and in the thalamus in SCA-3 suggest that cholinergic modulating drugs may have a role in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and other symptoms in these disorders </plain></SENT>
