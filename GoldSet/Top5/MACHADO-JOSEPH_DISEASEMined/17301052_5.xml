<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Parkin-associated endothelin receptor-like receptor (Pael-R) is a substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Misexpression of human Pael-R in Drosophila has been shown to induce selective <z:mp ids='MP_0003244'>loss of dopaminergic neurons</z:mp>, a symptom of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using this model, we investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi>), an evolutionarily conserved <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and molecular chaperone, could suppress the neurotoxicity induced by Pael-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Drosophila genome contains three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi>-encoding genes, namely TrxT, Trx-2, and dhd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When each of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> genes was overexpressed together with Pael-R in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neurons, the number of dopaminergic neurons and level of locomotor activity were significantly increased compared with control flies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess the role of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> in this context, we generated redox-defective mutants, TrxT(C35A) and TrxT(D26A/K57I), and coexpressed each of them with Pael-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutants suppressed the Pael-R neurotoxicity similarly to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> TrxT, although the extent of the rescue was slightly reduced for the locomotor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that both mutants remained active as chaperones, suggesting that this activity may be the major cause of the suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the absence of Pael-R, overexpression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neurons increased the level of locomotor activity in aged flies and extended the mean longevity by 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, overexpression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> suppressed neurotoxicity in a Drosophila model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> expressing polyglutamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results establish that Drosophila <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> can function as an anti-aging agent and as a suppressor of Pael-R- and poly-glutamine-induced neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
