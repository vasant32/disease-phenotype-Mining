<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A two-dimensional analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> was performed by using video-computer motion measurement system, PEAK, which has been developed and produced by U.S.-Japan-Chatanuuga Co., Ltd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The analyses of gait, heel-knee tapping test, finger-nose test and heel-knee test were made on 23 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002503'>spinocerebellar degeneration</z:hpo> (SCD) as compared with the 9 healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases of SCD included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002542'>olivopontocerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> (OPCA), hereditary OPCA, late cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> (LCCA), hereditary LCCA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> and dentatorubropallidoluysian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of analyses by the computer demonstrated slow movement of gait, decrease of flexion angle at knee joint at the swing phase of the gait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heel-knee test revealed irregular, dysrhythmic movements of heel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interval of the tapping showed great variance and its standard deviation of the average was found to be increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And the average values were so increased as to implement slow movements of the heel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These above-mentioned findings were also observed in the tests of finger-nose and heel-knee as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Oral intake of TA0910, TRH derivative, which was synthesized and produced by Tanabe pharmaceutical Co </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ltd. in Japan improved slow movements of the tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Disorders of range, direction, and rate of the movements, as usually observed in the patient of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, could be well recognized to be alleviated following the administration and the effects were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Application of the computerized instrument to analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> would be very beneficial in the neurological bed-side clinical examination </plain></SENT>
