<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, also spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>]) among Australian aborigines was caused by a new mutational event or by the introduction of expanded alleles from other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We sequenced a region of 4 kilobases (kb), encompassing the CAG repeat within the ATXN3 gene, in 2 affected Australian aboriginal families and compared them with the Joseph and Machado lineages described before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Full-extended haplotypes (including also more distant single-nucleotide polymorphisms and flanking short tandem repeats) were assessed by segregation and allele-specific amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A phylogenetic tree was inferred from genetic distances, and age of the Australasian Joseph-derived lineage was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The aboriginal communities of Groote Eylandt and Yirrkala, in the Northern Territories, Australia (local ethics institutional permission was granted, and both community and individual informed consent was obtained) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: A convenience sample of 19 patients and unaffected relatives, from 2 Australian aboriginal families affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>; 40 families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> of multiethnic origins and 50 unrelated Asian control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 2 aboriginal families shared the same full haplotype, including 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms:TTGATCGAGC-(CAG)(Exp)-CACCCAGCGC, that is, the Joseph lineage with a G variant in rs56268847.Among 33 families with the Joseph lineage, this derived haplotype was found only in 5 of 16 Taiwanese, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 Indian,and 1 of 3 Japanese families analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A related-extended <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> haplotype shared by Australian aborigines and some Asian families (a Joseph-derived lineage) suggests a common ancestor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, dating back more than 7000 years </plain></SENT>
