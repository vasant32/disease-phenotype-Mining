<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, presymptomatic gene testing has specific clinical and therapeutic implications for FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, at least in Portugal, FAP ATTR Val30Met is a serious health problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most important implications are: the possibility of family planning including prenatal and preimplantation diagnosis; treatment with liver transplantation (TX); clinical follow-up according to protocols for early diagnosis which will allow patients to access therapy in useful time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This concept of useful time in FAP treatment is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The growing possibilities of different therapeutic approaches are considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, presymptomatic gene testing for FAP may have a positive impact on candidate quality and prolongation of life, and on the future of disease studies </plain></SENT>
