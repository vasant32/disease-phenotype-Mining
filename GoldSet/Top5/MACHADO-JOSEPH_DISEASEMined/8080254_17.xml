<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was the product of a consanguineous marriage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maternal grandfather and paternal grandmother (brother and sister) living in the Azores were both affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) beginning late in life </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage studies in this family and others of Azorean descent have confirmed the recent mapping of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene to chromosome 14q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of the members of this pedigree provides strong genetic evidence that our patient is homozygous for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results combined with experience in 2 putative homozygotes previously reported in the literature suggest that gene dosage is an important determinant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and clinical phenotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
