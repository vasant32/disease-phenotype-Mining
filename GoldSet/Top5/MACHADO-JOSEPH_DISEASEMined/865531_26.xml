<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two post-mortem examinations revealed loss of neurons and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> in the substantia nigra, nuclei pontis (and in the putamen in one case) as well as in the nuclei of the vestibular and other cranial nerves, columns of Clarke and anterior horns, in the spinal cord there were also loss of fibers in the fasciculi gracilis and mild changes in the pyramidal tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the disease in this family with the findings reported in three families of similar ancestry, previously thought to have different disorders, suggests that they may <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> represent a single genetic entity with variable expression </plain></SENT>
