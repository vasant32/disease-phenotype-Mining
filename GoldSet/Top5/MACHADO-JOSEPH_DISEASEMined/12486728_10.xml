<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on a comprehensive computational analysis, we propose a structural model and structure-based functions for ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our predictive strategy comprises the compilation of multiple sequence and structure alignments of carefully selected proteins related to ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These alignments are consistent with additional information on sequence motifs, secondary structure, and domain architectures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The application of complementary methods revealed the homology of ataxin-3 to ENTH and VHS domain proteins involved in membrane trafficking and regulatory adaptor functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We modeled the structure of ataxin-3 using the adaptin AP180 as a template and assessed the reliability of the model by comparison with known sequence and structural features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We could further infer potential functions of ataxin-3 in agreement with known experimental data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our database searches also identified an as yet uncharacterized family of proteins, which we named josephins because of their pronounced homology to the Josephin domain of ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
