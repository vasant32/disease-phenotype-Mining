<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system degeneration was documented in postmortem reports, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>, either in clinical analysis or electrophysiological investigations, has not yet been studied in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with genetically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> and 34 healthy subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study design included a detailed questionnaire, R-R interval variation on deep breathing or Valsalva maneuver, and sympathetic skin response evoked by electrical stimulation of the median nerve or magnetic stimulation of the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent of patients had at least 3 symptoms involving different aspects of autonomic functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Voiding problems and thermoregulatory disturbance were the most common symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten (71%) of 14 patients had abnormal R-R interval variation with a significant reduction of the mean ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prolonged latency or absence of sympathetic skin response to electrical stimulation was identified in 73% of patients and to magnetic stimulation, in 53% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>R-R interval variation and sympathetic skin response showed good correlation with the functional stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electrical stimulation revealed the highest sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value compared with other tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present investigation documents that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> is not uncommon in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> and might be related to the clinical progression </plain></SENT>
