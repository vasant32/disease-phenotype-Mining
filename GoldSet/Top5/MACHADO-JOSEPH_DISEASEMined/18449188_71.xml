<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular and cellular pathways underlying polyQ-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> are the focus of much research, and it is widely considered that toxic activities of the protein, resulting from the abnormally long polyQ tract, cause pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we provide evidence for a pathogenic role of the CAG repeat <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in polyQ toxicity using Drosophila </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a Drosophila screen for modifiers of polyQ degeneration induced by the spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) protein ataxin-3, we isolated an upregulation allele of muscleblind (mbl), a gene implicated in the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> toxicity of CUG expansion diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further analysis indicated that there may be a toxic role of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in polyQ-induced degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We tested the role of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> by altering the CAG repeat sequence to an interrupted CAACAG repeat within the polyQ-encoding region; this dramatically mitigated toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, expression of an untranslated CAG repeat of pathogenic length conferred <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies reveal a role for the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in polyQ toxicity, highlighting common components in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-based and polyQ-protein-based trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases </plain></SENT>
