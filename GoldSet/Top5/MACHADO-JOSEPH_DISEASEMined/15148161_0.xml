<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To reappraise the clinical and pathological features of HAC in the current framework of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo>, we screened the autopsy records of la Salpêtrière hospital and identified a patient with a diagnosis of HAC who underwent an autopsy in 1943 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical features included heredity compatible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo>, increased tendon reflexes, mask-like face, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo>, nuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000597'>ophthalmoparesis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>exophthalmos</z:hpo> in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002073'>progressive ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathological lesions included the spinal cord (spinocerebellar tracts, anterolateral fascicles, and posterior column), cerebellar dentate nucleus, pontine nucleus, pallidum, motor neurons including the oculomotor nucleus, and substantia nigra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cerebellar cortex and inferior olives were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These clinical and pathological features, similar to those described in patients from the Haudebourg family, a core prototype of HAC, are indistinguishable from those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It would then be possible to conclude that some of the patients historically considered to have HAC would today be classified as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
