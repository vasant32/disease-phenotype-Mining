<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using this C/G polymorphism, we have engineered the small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) which decreased the expression of mutant ataxin-3, Q79C, by 96.0%, whereas there was minimal reduction on that of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, Q22G (5.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, unexpectedly, the expression of another <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> allele, Q22C, was also much less suppressed (22.5%) by this siRNA possibly due to difference of the secondary structure of the target <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of sequence-independent discrimination of mutant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> alleles by siRNA </plain></SENT>
