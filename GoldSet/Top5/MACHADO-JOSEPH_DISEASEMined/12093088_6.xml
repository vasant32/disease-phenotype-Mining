<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MB are demonstrable not only in humans but also in nonhuman primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study MB of aged rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta; n = 15; mean age 16 years) and aged baboons (Papio anubis; n = 13; mean age 25 years) were examined immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MB were found to be immunoreactive for ubiquitin, a protein involved in initiation of proteasome-mediated proteolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate that MB in monkeys are intensely immunoreactive for the protein ataxin-3 as detected by using two monoclonal anti-ataxin-3 antibodies (1H9 and 2B6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The abnormally expanded form of this polyglutamine protein is known to be causally involved in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal antibody 1C2 was employed to examine whether ataxin-3 in MB in monkeys contains such an abnormally expanded polyglutamine stretch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MB were consistently 1C2-immunonegative, indicating that they are composed of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion MB in nonhuman primates permit experimental examination of mechanisms involved in transnuclear localization, intranuclear aggregation, and ubiquitination of nonexpanded polyglutamine proteins </plain></SENT>
