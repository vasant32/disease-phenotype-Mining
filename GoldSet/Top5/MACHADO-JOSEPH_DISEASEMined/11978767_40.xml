<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported the generation of human yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) constructs encompassing the MJD1 locus into which expanded (CAG)(76) and (CAG)(84) repeat motifs have been introduced by homologous recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice containing pathological alleles with polyglutamine tract lengths of 64, 67, 72, 76 and 84 repeats, as well as the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> with 15 repeats, have now been generated using these YAC constructs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mice with expanded alleles demonstrate a mild and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> cerebellar deficit, manifesting as early as 4 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the disease progresses, pelvic elevation becomes markedly flattened, accompanied by <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, and motor and sensory loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuronal intranuclear inclusion (NII) formation and cell loss is prominent in the pontine and dentate nuclei, with variable cell loss in other regions of the cerebellum from 4 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, peripheral nerve <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003447'>axonal loss</z:hpo> is detected in symptomatic mice from 26 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, transgenic mice carrying the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (CAG)(15) allele of the MJD1 locus appear completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at 20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disease severity increases with the level of expression of the expanded protein and the size of the repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These mice are representative of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and will be a valuable resource for the detailed analysis of the roles of repeat length, tissue specificity and level of expression in the neurodegenerative processes underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
