<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the significance of Ataxin-3 cleavage, we developed a Drosophila SL2 cell-based model as well as transgenic fly models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that Ataxin-3 protein cleavage is conserved in the fly and may be caspase-dependent as reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, comparison of flies expressing either <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or caspase-site mutant proteins indicates that Ataxin-3 cleavage enhances <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
