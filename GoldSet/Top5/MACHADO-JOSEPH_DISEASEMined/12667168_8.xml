<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polyglutamine CAG stretches in the neuronal cytoplasms and nuclei were studied with immunolabeling using 1C2, a monoclonal antibody recognizing polyglutamine stretches, and polyclonal antiubiquitin antibody in six genetically verified cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>1C2 clearly labeled two types of <z:mp ids='MP_0004191'>neuronal intranuclear inclusions</z:mp> (NII) and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI) in the substantia nigra, pontine nucleus, dentate nucleus and spinal anterior horn where NII and NCI were also positive for ubiquitin, as were extracellular dot-like structures and oligodendroglial inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1C2-positive NII and NCI had a lesion-specific distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the spinal motoneurons contained only 1C2-positive NCI and lacked 1C2-positive NII, the ventral pontine nucleus neurons had many 1C2-positive NII and few 1C2-positive NCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Semi-quantitative examination of NII and NCI positive for 1C2 or ubiquitin demonstrated that there were more 1C2-positive NII and NCI than ubiquitin-positive ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that the nuclei of the spinal motoneurons lacked 1C2-positive immunoreactivity, so that ubiquitination of 1C2-positive structures is presumed to occur late in the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
