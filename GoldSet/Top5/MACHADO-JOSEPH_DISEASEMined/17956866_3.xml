<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The propensity of proteins to form beta-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils is related to a variety of biological phenomena, including a number of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> and prions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A subset of amyloidogenic proteins forms amyloid fibrils through glutamine/asparagine (Q/N)-rich domains, such as pathogenic polyglutamine (poly(Q)) proteins involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo>, as well as yeast prions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the former, the propensity of an expanded poly(Q) tract to abnormally fold confers toxicity on the respective protein, leading to neuronal dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the latter, Q/N-rich prion domains mediate protein aggregation important for epigenetic regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the relationship between the pathogenic ataxin-3 protein of the human disease spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) and the yeast prion Sup35, using Drosophila as a model system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that the capacity of the Sup35 prion domain to mediate protein aggregation is conserved in Drosophila </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although select yeast prions enhance poly(Q) toxicity in yeast, the Sup35N prion domain suppressed poly(Q) toxicity in the fly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Suppression required the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25676">oligopeptide</z:chebi> repeat of the Sup35N prion domain, which is critical for prion properties in yeast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a trans effect of prion domains on pathogenic poly(Q) disease proteins in a multicellular environment and raise the possibility that Drosophila may allow studies of prion mechanisms </plain></SENT>
