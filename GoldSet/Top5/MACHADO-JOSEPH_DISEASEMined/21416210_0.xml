<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To disclose the neuropathological progression course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of six genetically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> cases (four males and two females, including an autopsied female, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> unrelated to one another) were further investigated on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI studies were repeated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases at different stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ages at the first MRI study ranged from 47 to 65 years (55.2 ± 7.1), with observation periods from 4.5 to 10.6 years (6.95 ± 2.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We paid particular attention to two types of previously reported MRI findings detectable using T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One is located just outside the internal capsules, and another in the pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A linear high-intensity change along the internal capsules was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, and showed progression during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A comparison between MRI and autopsy findings suggested that the lesion might reflect degeneration with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> in the internal segment of the globus pallidus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cross-shaped high-intensity change in the pons was well advanced but still incomplete in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this region, pontine transverse fibers were atrophic, while longitudinal fibers remained intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pontine nuclei showed apparent nerve cell loss, and the remaining cells had many 1C2-positive intranuclear inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since these findings were detected both by lifetime images and by postmortem examination, MRI intensity changes could track the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on a comparison between MRI findings and neuropathology, the degeneration of an internal segment of the globus pallidus (one of the pathological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) had progressed following the initial symptoms </plain></SENT>
