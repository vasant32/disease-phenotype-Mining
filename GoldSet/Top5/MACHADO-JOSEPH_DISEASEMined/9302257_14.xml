<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CAG repeat expansions are translated to elongated polyglutamine tracts and an <z:mp ids='MP_0001264'>increased size</z:mp> of the polyglutamine tract correlates with anticipation, the cardinal feature, seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>Autosomal dominant</z:hpo> pure spastic peraplegia (ADPSP) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disorder</z:e> of the central motor system clinically characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> and unremitting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> of the legs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001347'>hyperreflexia</z:hpo> and Babinski's sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Like the established CAG repeat diseases ADPSP is characterized by both inter- and intrafamilial variation and anticipation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the Repeat Expansion Detection (RED) method, we have analyzed 21 affected individuals from six Danish families with the disease linked to chromosome 2p21-p24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that 20 of 21 affected individuals showed CAG repeat expansions versus two of 21 healthy spouses, demonstrating a strongly statistically significant association between the occurrence of the repeat expansion and the disease (Fisher's test, P &lt; 10(-5)) suggesting that a CAG repeat expansion is involved presumably as a dynamic mutation in ADPSP linked to chromosome 2p21-p24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The size of the expansion is estimated to be &gt; or = 60 CAG repeat copies in the affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CAG repeat expansion is very likely translated and expressed as indicated by the detection of a polyglutamine-containing protein in an ADPSP patient </plain></SENT>
