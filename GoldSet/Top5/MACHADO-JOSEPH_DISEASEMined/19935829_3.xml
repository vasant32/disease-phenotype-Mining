<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> is dependent on the presence of an expansion of the (CAG)(n) motif within exon 10 of the ATXN3 gene, located at 14q32.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The variance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> is only partially correlated (approximately 50-80%) with the extension of the CAG tract in genomic DNA (gDNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main aim of this work was to determine whether there are discrepancies in the size of the (CAG)(n) tract between gDNA and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and to establish whether there is a better association between age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and repeat size at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We typed gDNA and cDNA samples for the (CAG)(n) tract totalizing 108 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and 52 expanded ATXN3 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> alleles no differences were found between gDNA and cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In expanded alleles, the CAG repeat size in gDNA was not always directly transcribed into the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>; on average there were differences of +1 repeat at the cDNA level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The slight discrepancies obtained were insufficient to cause significant differences in the distribution of the expanded alleles, and therefore no improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> variance explanation was obtained with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
