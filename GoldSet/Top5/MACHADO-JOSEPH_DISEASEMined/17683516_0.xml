<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, fitness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> carriers has been little studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze genetic fitness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients, comparing them to their unaffected relatives and to the general population (GP) of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 182 informants, belonging to 82 MJD families, agreed to participate in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Informants supplied data about 828 MJD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Number of children (NC), gender, age, school attainment, menarche and menopause were compared between general and emeritus (older than 45 years of age or deceased) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean NC of the GP and of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients were respectively 1.90 and 2.93+/-2.3 (p = 0.0037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparisons within families also showed differences: the mean NC of unaffected and affected emeritus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> women were, respectively, 2.68 and 3.89 (p = 0.0037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Affected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> women had earlier mean ages at the delivery of their first child and menopause (p &lt; 0.011 and 0.07, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among affected women those who did not have children had larger CAG tracts than those who had children (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> enhances the fitness of its carriers, and this phenomenon seems to have a biological basis </plain></SENT>
