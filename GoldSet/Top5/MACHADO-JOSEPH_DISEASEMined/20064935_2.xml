<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expanded proteins typically accumulate in large intranuclear inclusions and induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms that determine the subcellular site and rate of inclusion formation are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the conserved putative nuclear localization sequence Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg, which is retained in a highly aggregation-prone fragment of ataxin-3, did not affect the site and degree of inclusion formation in a cell culture model of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Addition of synthetic nuclear export or import signals led to the expected localization of ataxin-3 and determined the subcellular site of aggregate formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Triggering a cellular stress response by heat shock transcription factor DeltaHSF1 coexpression abrogated aggregation in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that native aggregation-prone fragments derived from expanded ataxin-3 may eventually escape the cytoplasmic quality control, resulting in aggregation in the nuclear compartment </plain></SENT>
