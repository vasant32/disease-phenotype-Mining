<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Three-dimensional anisotropy contrast (3DAC) based on a periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (PROPELLER) sequence on a 3.0 T system is a new magnetic resonance imaging technique capable of providing images with significantly high anatomical resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to confirm whether this technique can characterize the degenerative processes in the brainstem of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002503'>spinocerebellar degeneration</z:hpo> (SCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 3DAC images of 13 patients with multiple system <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> with predominant cerebellar symptoms (MSA-C) and seven International Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> Rating Scale (ICARS) score-matched patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) were created using a diffusion-weighted PROPELLER sequence on a 3.0T system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The section of the middle pons was chosen for morphometric and diffusivity analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The above analyses showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and increased diffusivity of the ventral portion of the pons indicated MSA-C, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and increased diffusivity of the pontine tegmentum indicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ICARS scores significantly correlated with both the severities of the pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and the mean diffusivity values of the ventral pontocerebellar tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that 3DAC PROPELLER on a 3.0T system enables in vivo "tract by tract" quantitative analysis of pontine degeneration in SCD </plain></SENT>
