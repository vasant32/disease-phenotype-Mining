<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous attempts to create a transgenic animal model have failed to produce a neurological deficit truly representative of the disease phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This appears to be the result of inappropriate expression of the mutant protein in neuronal populations generally spared in the disease state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Introduction of a human disease gene in the context of a yeast artificial chromosome clone containing endogenous regulatory elements would enhance the potential for correct tissue/cell-specific expression at physiological levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report the introduction of expanded CAG repeat motifs into a 250kb yeast artificial chromosome clone spanning the MJD1 locus using two rounds of homologous recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transformants exhibited both expansions and contractions of the motif with alleles ranging in size from 48 to 84 repeat units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The availability of these clones for modelling of the disease in transgenic animals should allow elucidation of the role of repeat length in the phenotypic spectrum of the disease </plain></SENT>
