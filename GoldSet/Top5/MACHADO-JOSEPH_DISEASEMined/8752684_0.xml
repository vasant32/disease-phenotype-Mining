<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to clarify a correlation between the esophageal dysfunction and suffocation after meals in patients with myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> (MD) and to find how to prevent such accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using imaging methods, we examined eight patients with MD (six of them had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">difficulty in swallowing</z:e>), four patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular diseases</z:e> (Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>, and Duchenne's <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>), and two healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also investigated material from an autopsy of another patient with MD who died of suffocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with MD, fluoroscopy and computed tomography showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the esophagus, particularly in the proximal third, and residual contrast media in the esophagus 15 to 40 minutes after swallowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In histologic studies, morphologic changes were confined to the esophageal striated muscle in a patient with MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that regurgitation from the esophagus to the trachea happens more than 40 minutes after swallowing in patients with MD and that histological alterations of striated muscle are primary causes of the esophageal dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From these findings, we propose that patients with MD should not lie down at least 40 minutes after meals whether they complain of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">difficulty in swallowing</z:e> or not </plain></SENT>
