<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that expanded polyQ of ataxin-3 (Q79C), a gene that causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, stimulates Ku70 acetylation, which in turn dissociates the proapoptotic protein Bax from Ku70, thereby promoting Bax activation and subsequent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Q79C-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was significantly blocked by Ku70 or Bax-inhibiting <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (BIPs) designed from Ku70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, expression of SIRT1 deacetylase and the addition of a SIRT1 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi>, reduced Q79C toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mimicking acetylation of Ku70 abolished the ability of Ku70 to suppress Q79C toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that Bax and Ku70 acetylation play important roles in Q79C-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and that BIP may be useful in the development of therapeutics for polyQ diseases </plain></SENT>
