<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have generated and characterized a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against ataxin-3 and used them to analyze its expression and localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Hela cells, multiple isoforms are expressed besides the major 55-kDa form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the majority of ataxin-3 is cytosolic, both immunocytofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies indicate the presence of ataxin-3, in particular, of some of the minor isoforms, in the nuclear and mitochodrial compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also show that ataxin-3 can be phosphorylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the brain, only one ataxin-3 isoform containing the polyglutamine stretch was detected, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutated proteins were found equally expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient brain regions analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In most neurons, ataxin-3 had a cytoplasmic, dendritic, and axonal localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some neurons presented an additional nuclear localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3 is widely expressed throughout the brain, with a variable intensity specific for subpopulations of neurons </plain></SENT>
