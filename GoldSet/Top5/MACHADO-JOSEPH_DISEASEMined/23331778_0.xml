<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Sleep structure disruption and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004930" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavior disorders</z:e> (RBD) have been previously reported in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, similar studies have rarely been quantitatively conducted in type 3 spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> and 16 healthy controls were recruited and evaluated by clinical history, International Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> Rating Scale (ICARS), Epworth sleepiness scale (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESS</z:e>), and polysomnography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> had reductions in sleep efficiency and percentage of REM sleep, which were negatively correlated with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> as evaluated by ICARS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>REM sleep reduction occurred regardless of the presence of RBD, and severe reduction of REM sleep may significantly disturb the assessment of RBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Poor sleep efficiency and REM sleep aberrations are the characteristics of sleep structure disruption in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> as the disease progresses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of respiratory disturbance during sleep or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002189'>excessive daytime sleepiness</z:hpo> was not significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients than controls </plain></SENT>
