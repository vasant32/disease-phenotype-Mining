<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 7 patients included 4 with type I and 3 with type II disease; their mean age was 45.7 +/- 12.09 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diseased controls were matched in age to the patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these patients, CSF beta-endorphin level was significantly lower than in the controls (40% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An alteration in CSF beta-endorphin level may explain some of the neurological impairment found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
