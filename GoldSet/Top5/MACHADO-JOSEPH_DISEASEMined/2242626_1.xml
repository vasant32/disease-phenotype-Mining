<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ABR was recorded in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 8 patients, ABR were abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients, the latency of I wave was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but other waves could not be evoked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the other 3 patients, I-III interpeak latency was prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SEP was recorded in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In SEP of median nerve, 11 patients had abnormal findings, and SEP of posterior tibial nerve revealed abnormal findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, responses from Erb's point and popliteal fossa were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in latency, but other peaks were low in amplitude or absent, and the latency and central conduction time (CCT) were prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The result of ABR indicated the involvement of the brainstem auditory pathways in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, and the result of SEP suggested that somatosensory pathways, particularly central pathways, would be involved in the disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ABR and SEP can be potential diagnostic methods for detection of subclinical abnormality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
