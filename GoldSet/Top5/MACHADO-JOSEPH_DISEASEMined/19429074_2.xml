<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and decreased expression of Hsp27 may be contributory factors to the disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we utilized <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> SK-N-SH cells stably transfected with full-length expanded ataxin-3 to further investigate the mechanism(s) resulting in the decreased expression of Hsp27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>-methionine pulse-chase labeling and protein degradation assays revealed that decreased Hsp27 in mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> cells is due to defects in protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results further demonstrated that Hsp27 degradation is independent of the proteasome degradation pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we showed that overexpression of Hsp27 desensitizes mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> cells to apoptotic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings provide the first evidence that expanded ataxin-3 interferes with Hsp27 synthesis, which may contribute to the impairment of the cells' ability to respond to stresses and trigger the progression of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
