<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It contains multiple ubiquitin binding sites through which it anchors polyubiquitin chains of different linkages that are then cleaved by the N-terminal catalytic (Josephin) domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The properties of the ubiquitin interacting motifs (UIMs) in the C-terminus of ataxin-3 are well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Very little is known, however, about how two recently identified ubiquitin-binding sites in the Josephin domain contribute to ubiquitin chain binding and cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we sought to define the specific contribution of the Josephin domain to the catalytic properties of ataxin-3 and assess how the topology and affinity of these binding sites modulate ataxin-3 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using NMR we modeled the structure of diUb/Josephin complexes and showed that linkage preferences are imposed by the topology of the two binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enzymatic studies further helped us to determine a precise hierarchy between the sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We establish that the structure of Josephin dictates specificity for K48-linked chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Site 1, which is close to the active site, is indispensable for cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our studies open the way to understand better the cellular function of ataxin-3 and its link to pathology </plain></SENT>
