<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cloning of the MJD1 gene allowed identification of the disease in many other populations, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> is now known to be the most common cause of dominant spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that its present world distribution could result from the spread of an original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation has been raised, both at historical and molecular levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by linkage-disequilibrium analysis of tightly linked polymorphisms and by haplotype comparison, in 249 families from different countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We typed five microsatellite markers surrounding the MJD1 locus (D14S1015, D14S995, D14S973, D14S1016, and D14S977), and three intragenic single-base-pair polymorphisms (A(669)TG/G(669)TG, C(987)GG/G(987)GG, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>(1118)/<z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi>(1118)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results show two different haplotypes, specific to the island of origin, in families of Azorean extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In families from mainland Portugal, both Azorean haplotypes can be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of the non-Portuguese families also share the same intragenic haplotype seen in the families coming from the island of Flores, but at least three other haplotypes were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest two introductions of the mutation into the Portuguese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Worldwide, the sharing of one intragenic haplotype by the majority of the families studied implies a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
