<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (AO) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) is closely associated with the length of the CAG repeat at the mutant ATXN3 allele, but there are other intervening factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental evidence indicates that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ATXN3 allele and the C-terminal heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)-interacting protein (CHIP) may be genetic modifiers of AO in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: To investigate this hypothesis, we determined the length of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and expanded CAG repeats at the ATXN3 gene in 210 unrelated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CHIP gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We first compared the frequencies of the different genotypes in two subgroups of patients who were highly discordant for AO after correction for the length of the expanded CAG allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possible modifier effect of each gene was then evaluated in a stepwise multiple linear regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: AO was associated with the length of the expanded CAG allele (r(2) = 0.596, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CAG repeats at the ATXN3 gene and of CHIP polymorphisms did not differ significantly between groups with highly discordant ages at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, addition of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele improved the model fit for prediction of AO (r(2) = 0.604, p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we found that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CAG allele at ATXN3 had a positive independent effect on AO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CAG repeat at the ATXN3 gene has a small but significant influence on AO of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
