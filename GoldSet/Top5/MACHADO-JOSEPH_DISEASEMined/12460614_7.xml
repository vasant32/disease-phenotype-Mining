<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to clarify a possible influence of NAs on neurons in human brains, we quantified the size and deformity of neuronal nuclei (those with or without NAs, separately) cross-sectioned on pontine preparations of autopsied brains from four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and five controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nuclear shrinkage and deformity were more marked in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> brains than in controls, and these changes were attenuated in neurons harboring NAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NAs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> are presumably linked to a mechanism that attenuates rather than accelerates nuclear shrinkage and deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding leads us to consider that NAs are not necessarily toxic to neurons in diseased human brains </plain></SENT>
