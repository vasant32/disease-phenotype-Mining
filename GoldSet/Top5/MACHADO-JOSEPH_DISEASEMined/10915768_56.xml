<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mutant ataxin-3 forms intranuclear inclusions in cultured cells as well as in diseased human brain and also causes cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function of ataxin-3 remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To explore the function of ataxin-3, we used the two-hybrid system to screen for the protein(s) that interacts with ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that ataxin-3 interacts with two human homologs of the yeast DNA repair protein RAD23, HHR23A and HHR23B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we confirmed that ataxin-3 interacts with the -ubiquitin-like domain at the N-terminus of the HHR23 proteins, which is important for nucleotide excision repair; however, ataxin-3 does not interact with -ubiquitin, implying that ataxin-3 might be functionally associated with the HHR23 proteins through this specific interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant ataxin-3 proteins show no difference in their ability to bind to the HHR23 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in 293 cells HHR23A is recruited to intranuclear inclusions formed by the mutant ataxin-3 through its interaction with ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that this interaction is associated with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function of ataxin-3 and that some functional abnormality of the HHR23 proteins might exist in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
