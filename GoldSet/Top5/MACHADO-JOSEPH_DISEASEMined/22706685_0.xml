<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Alternative splicing (AS) of pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is an important regulatory mechanism that enables one gene to produce multiple mature transcripts and, therefore, multiple protein isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides the information content of core splicing signals, additional cis-regulatory elements (splicing enhancers and silencers) are needed to precisely define exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AS is well documented in ATXN3 gene, which encodes for ataxin-3 and, when mutated, is responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By studying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients and controls, we have previously identified 56 alternative transcript variants for this gene; some were predicted to encode "protective" ataxin-3 isoforms, making then pertinent to understand AS regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study aims to investigate the relationship between variation in ATXN3 cis-regulatory motifs and AS variants found for each individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have sequenced exonic and flanking intronic ATXN3 regions, in genomic DNA from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients and controls previously studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were found was located in core splicing signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In silico analysis showed those SNPs implied losses and gains of recognition motifs for splicing factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each particular allele was not directly reflected in alterations of the resulting splicing variants, indicating that AS cannot be determined solely by these cis-elements, but should result from a more complex mode of regulation </plain></SENT>
