<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Direct detection of the expansion in the patient's genome shortcuts the tedious process needed for identification of disease genes by conventional approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a method to detect triplet repeat expansion from the hybridization signal intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi>-labeled (CTG)9 probe, the hybridization intensity and number of repeats showed a good linear correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The technique detected expansion in genomic DNA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with moderate or large expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even in the case of a small expansion, this method could detect the mutant fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The technique has advantages over related techniques because it is more sensitive and can be applied to cases where a small repeat expansion is involved </plain></SENT>
