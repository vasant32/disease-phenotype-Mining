<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the islands of the Azores (Portugal), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> reaches the highest prevalence reported worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been postulated that it is highly represented in the Azorean population as a result of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we reconstructed the ascending genealogies of the 32 Azorean families presently identified as harboring the disease (103 patients), using parish records as the main source of data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were originally from the islands of São Miguel, Terceira, Graciosa, and Flores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The genealogies of the two main Azorean American families (Machado and Joseph) were also reconstructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To identify the links between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> families, we calculated the kinship coefficient between the proponents of these genealogies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The family from Terceira was linked to three different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> families from Flores through common ancestors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No kinship was observed between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> families from São Miguel and families from any other island </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Links between the two Azorean American families and Azorean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> families were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founders</z:e> present in more than one ascendance were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Their chronological and geographic distribution indicates that more than one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> mutation was introduced in the Azores, probably by settlers coming from the Portuguese mainland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The molecular evidence to date corroborates these results, because two distinct haplotypes have been established, one on the island of São Miguel and the other on Flores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore molecular biology studies confirm the accuracy of the conclusions drawn from the genealogical evidence supporting the absence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> in the Azorean population </plain></SENT>
