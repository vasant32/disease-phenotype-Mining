<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we provide evidence that the co-chaperone and ubiquitin ligase, CHIP (C-terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein), is a central component to the homeostatic mechanisms countering toxic polyQ proteins in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic reduction or elimination of CHIP accelerates disease in transgenic mice expressing polyQ-expanded ataxin-3, the disease protein in Spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> Type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In parallel, CHIP reduction markedly increases the level of ataxin-3 microaggregates, which partition in the soluble fraction of brain lysates yet are resistant to dissociation with denaturing detergent, and which precede the appearance of inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of microaggregates in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, but not of ataxin-3 monomer, correlates with disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional cell-based studies suggest that either of two quality control ubiquitin ligases, CHIP or E4B, can reduce steady state levels of expanded, but not <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results support an aggregation model of polyQ disease pathogenesis in which ataxin-3 microaggregates are a neurotoxic species, and suggest that enhancing CHIP activity is a possible route to therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> and other polyQ diseases </plain></SENT>
