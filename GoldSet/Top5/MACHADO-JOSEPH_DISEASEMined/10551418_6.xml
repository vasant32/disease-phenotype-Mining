<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The allele frequencies, genetic distances between populations, correspondence analyses and most frequent haplotypes were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the Azorean population most likely contains an admixture of high-frequency Caucasoid, Mongoloid and, to a lesser degree, Negroid HLA genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The middle Atlantic Azores Archipelago was officially colonized by the Portuguese after 1439 and historical records are concordant with the existence of Caucasoid and Negroid population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, Mongoloid genes were not suspected, but the Oriental HLA haplotypes A24-B44-DR6-DQ1, A29-B21-DR7-DQ2 and A2-B50-DR7-DQ2 are the fourth, fifth and sixth most frequent ones in Azores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A correspondence analysis shows that the Azorean population is equidistant from Asian and European populations and genetic distances are in some cases closer to the Asian than to European ethnic groups, and never are significantly different; also, B*2707 subtype is found in Asians and Azoreans (but not in Europeans) and the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph Disease</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotypes (Chr 14) are found in both Japanese and Azoreans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that a Mongoloid population exists in Azores; whether, the arrival occurred prior to discovery is undetermined </plain></SENT>
