<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> damage associated with pathological findings of brain tissues could provide molecular biomarkers of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective: The potential of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) damage as a biomarker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> progression was investigated using a transgenic mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: DNA was obtained from affected (pontine nuclei) and nonaffected tissues (hippocampus and blood) of transgenic animals of three distinct age groups: 8 weeks, before <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the phenotype; 16 weeks, at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and 24 weeks, at well-established phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> littermate mice, serving as controls, were analyzed for the same tissues and age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>mtDNA damage was studied by fluorescence-based quantitative PCR in 84 transgenic and 93 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: A clear pattern of decrease in mtDNA copy number with age and accumulation of 3,867-bp deletions at the initial stages (both being more pronounced in transgenic mice) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pontine nuclei, the affected tissue in transgenic mice, displayed 1.5 times less copies of mtDNA than nonaffected brain tissue hippocampus (odds ratio = 1.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pontine nuclei displayed the highest percentage of mtDNA deletions (6.05% more in transgenic mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: These results suggest that mtDNA damage is related to the initiation of the phenotype in transgenic mice; mtDNA 3,867-bp deletions may be a biomarker of the initial stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
