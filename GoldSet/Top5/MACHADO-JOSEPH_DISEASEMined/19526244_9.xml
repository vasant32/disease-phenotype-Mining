<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify whether pathological TDP-43 is present in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> involving the motor neuron system, we immunohistochemically examined the brain and spinal cord affected by two CAG repeat (polyglutamine) diseases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) and spinal and bulbar <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscular atrophy</z:hpo> (SBMA), using polyclonal antibody against TDP-43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> cases, TDP-43-immunoreactive (ir) neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs), although few in number, were found only in the lower motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TDP-43-ir NCIs appeared as linear wisp-like, skein-like, or thick, somewhat rod-like bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These inclusions were also visualized with antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37712">phosphoserines</z:chebi> 409 and 410 of TDP-43, and ubiquitin, but were not recognized by antibody against expanded polyglutamine stretches or ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructure of the TDP-43-ir NCIs was similar to that of the inclusions seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> ALS, consisting of bundles of parallel filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the SBMA cases showed abnormal TDP-43 immunoreactivity in any of the regions examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis failed to recognize hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 at ~23 kDa in two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> cases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the immunohistochemical findings strongly suggested that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, in addition to the polyglutamine-dependent disease process, TDP-43-related pathogenesis is associated with degeneration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the lower motor neurons </plain></SENT>
