<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we used an amino-terminal fragment of a mutant Huntingtin protein (Htt-N-82Q) as bait in an unbiased screen of a 60,000 peptoid library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peptoid HQP09 was selected from the isolated hits and confirmed as a specific ligand of Htt-N-82Q and Atxn3-77Q mutant proteins in biochemical experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified three critical residues in the HQP09 sequence that are important for its activity and generated a minimal derivative, HQP09_9, which maintains the specific polyQ-binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that HQP09 and HQP09_9 inhibited aggregation of Htt-N-53Q in vitro and exerted Ca(2+)-stabilizing and neuroprotective effects in experiments with primary striatal neuronal cultures derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrated that intracerebroventricular delivery of HQP09 to an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> mouse model resulted in reduced accumulation of mutant Huntingtin aggregates and improved motor behavioral outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that HQP09 and similar peptoids hold promise as novel therapeutics for developing treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, and other polyglutamine expansion disorders </plain></SENT>
