<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The goal of this investigation was the systematic assessment of synapses in the hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo> by the immunocytochemical and immunofluorescent visualization of SNAP-25, a protein of the presynaptic membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sections were prepared from the cerebellar cortex, dentate nucleus, basis pontis, inferior olivary nuclei, and the spinal cord in 57 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> and recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neuropathological phenotype included 18 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002542'>olivopontocerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> (OPCA), 14 cases of familial cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> (FCCA), 4 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>), and 21 cases of Friedreich's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (FA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo>, spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 1 (SCA-1), SCA-2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>/SCA-3, and SCA-6 were represented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expanded <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> trinucleotide repeats were confirmed in 7 patients with FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The abundance of SNAP-25 was estimated by comparing the fluorescence of the regions of interest to that of the frontal cortex, which was considered unaffected by the disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite severe Purkinje cell loss, abundant SNAP-25 reaction product remained in the molecular layer of FCCA and OPCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the cases of OPCA, those identified as SCA-2 showed the most severe overall synaptic destruction in cerebellum and brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In SCA-1, which caused either OPCA or FCCA, significant synaptic loss was restricted to the inferior olivary nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sparing of cerebellar cortex and inferior olivary nuclei was the rule for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>/SCA-3 and FA, though the dentate nucleus showed reduced SNAP-25 immunoreactivity in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In FA, preservation of SNAP-25 in the dentate nucleus was characteristic of long survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Severe cases with short survival revealed synaptic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of the dentate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At the level of the spinal cord, synaptic loss in the dorsal nuclei of Clarke characterized FA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>/SCA-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The inexorable clinical progression of the hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo> could not be attributed to synaptic loss in a single anatomic structure of cerebellum, brain stem, or spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, synaptic loss in dentate and inferior olivary nuclei correlated more precisely with the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> than the changes in the cerebellar cortex </plain></SENT>
