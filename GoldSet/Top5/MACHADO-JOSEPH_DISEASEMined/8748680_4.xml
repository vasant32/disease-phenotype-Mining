<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical results were as follows; mild improvements of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001347'>hyperreflexia</z:hpo> of knee jerks and of rigospasticity of the legs during S-T treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, S-T significantly reduced the times of 8 motor activities on the timed tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biochemical results showed that basal levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15373">biopterins</z:chebi> and homovanillic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were reduced to less than half the levels of those of controls with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After S-T treatment, total and oxidized form of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15373">biopterins</z:chebi> in the CSF increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, S-T may be effective to neurologic deficits through its mechanism of increasing the level of brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15373">biopterins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
