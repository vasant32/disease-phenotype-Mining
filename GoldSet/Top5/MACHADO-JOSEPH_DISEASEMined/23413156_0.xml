<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study are to determine the frequency and the intensity of autonomic manifestations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, as well as to identify possible correlations between autonomic manifestations and genetic and clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have performed clinical and electrophysiological evaluations of 40 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and 38 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> (SARA) and the scales for Outcomes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's Disease</z:e>: Autonomic Questionnaire to quantify the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and autonomic complaints, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also studied heart rate variability at rest, during orthostatic challenge (30:15 ratio), Valsalva maneuver (Valsalva index), and deep breathing (E/I ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated spectral analyses of RR intervals at rest and the sympathetic skin response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean RR intervals at rest and the 30:15 ratio were different between patients and controls (811.8 versus 933.4 ms; p = 0.001 and 1.10 versus 1.15; p = 0.038, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Valsalva index and the E/I ratio were similar between the groups (p = 0.373 and p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Spectral analysis presented distinct results in patients and controls, related to low- and high-frequency power (p &lt; 0.001 and &lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found cardiovascular and sympathetic sweat disautonomia in 30 % and 45 % of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Autonomic manifestations were related neither to genetic (CAG repeat length) nor clinical parameters (age, disease duration, SARA scores) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>Autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> is frequent and sometimes disabling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found evidence of both cardiovascular and sudomotor dysfunction in the disease </plain></SENT>
