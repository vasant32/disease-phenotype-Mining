<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, there are no reports on cutaneous vasomotor function in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> on cutaneous sympathetic function, we evaluated cutaneous vasomotor and sudomotor responses in the palms of 15 patients (mean age, 49 ± 15 years; seven men and eight women) who were genetically diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> as well as in the palms of 15 age-matched, healthy controls (mean age, 48 ± 16 years; nine men and six women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sweat response was absent in 10 (67 %) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, and the mean amplitude of sweat response was significantly lower (p&lt;0.0001) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> than in healthy controls following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038443" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental stress</z:e> (mental arithmetic) and physiological stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although vasoconstrictive response was absent in three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> (20 %), there were no significant differences in the mean amplitude of vasoconstrictive response between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> have reduced cutaneous sympathetic response, including severely impaired sudomotor functions and mildly affected vasomotor functions </plain></SENT>
