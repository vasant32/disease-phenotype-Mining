<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have isolated and sequenced cDNAs representing the full-length (2987-bp) gene for dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (E2k component) of the human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16810">alpha-ketoglutarate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC) from a human fetal brain cDNA library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The E2k cDNA was mapped to human chromosome 14 using a somatic cell hybrid panel, and more precisely to band 14q24.3 by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cDNA also cross-hybridized to an apparent E2k pseudogene on chromosome 1p31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Northern analysis revealed the E2k gene to be ubiquitously expressed in peripheral tissues and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, chromosome 14q24.3 has recently been reported to contain gene defects for an early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0276496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">familial Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Future studies will be necessary to determine whether the E2k gene plays a role in either of these two disorders </plain></SENT>
