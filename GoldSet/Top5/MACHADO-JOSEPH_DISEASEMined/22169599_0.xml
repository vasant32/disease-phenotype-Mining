<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether there is an association between mtDNA variations and spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (SCA), we analyzed the mtDNA main control region (D-loop), as well as mtDNA content and the prevalence of the common deletion, in blood samples from members of a large Chinese family (14 individuals with SCA and 13 healthy individuals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 14 individuals with SCA were genotyped as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We detected no mutations in the mtDNA D-loop region and found no significant differences in mtDNA copy number or common deletion level between patients and their healthy relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrary to some previous reports, our study showed that mtDNA variations seem to be a rare event in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>
