<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 is one of the polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, which are caused by a CAG-repeat expansion within the coding region of the associated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CAG repeat specifies glutamine, and the expanded polyQ domain mutation confers dominant toxicity on the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, studies have focused on protein toxicity in polyQ disease mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent findings, however, demonstrate that the CAG-repeat <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, which encodes the toxic polyQ protein, also contributes to the disease in Drosophila </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To provide insights into the nature of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> toxicity, we extracted brain-enriched <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from flies expressing a toxic CAG-repeat <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (CAG100) and a non-toxic interrupted CAA/G <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> repeat (CAA/G105) for microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This approach identified 160 genes that are differentially expressed specifically in CAG100 flies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional annotation clustering analysis revealed several broad ontologies enriched in the CAG100 gene list, including iron ion binding and nucleotide binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, transcripts for the Hsp70 genes, a powerful suppressor of polyQ and other human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, were also upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We therefore tested and showed that upregulation of heat shock protein 70 mitigates CAG-repeat <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We then assessed whether other modifiers of the pathogenic, expanded Ataxin-3 polyQ protein could also modify the CAG-repeat <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This approach identified the co-chaperone Tpr2, the transcriptional regulator Dpld, and the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-binding protein Orb2 as modifiers of both polyQ protein toxicity and CAG-repeat <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-based toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest an overlap in the mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein-based toxicity, providing insights into the pathogenicity of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in polyQ disease </plain></SENT>
