<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To obtain quantitative data on the progression of the most common spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo> (SCAs) and identify factors that influence their progression, we initiated the EUROSCA natural history study, a multicentric longitudinal cohort study of 526 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>, SCA2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the results of the 1- and 2-year follow-up visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: As the primary outcome measure we used the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> (SARA, 0-40), and as a secondary measure the Inventory of Non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> Symptoms (INAS, 0-16) count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The annual increase of the SARA score was greatest in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> (2.18 ± 0.17, mean ± SE) followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> (1.61 ± 0.12) and SCA2 (1.40 ± 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SARA progression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> was slowest and nonlinear (first year: 0.35 ± 0.34, second year: 1.44 ± 0.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the INAS count yielded similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Larger expanded repeats and earlier age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were associated with faster SARA progression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> and SCA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>, repeat length of the expanded allele had a similar effect on INAS progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, SARA progression was influenced by the disease duration at inclusion, and INAS progression was faster in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study gives a comprehensive quantitative account of disease progression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>, SCA2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> and identifies factors that specifically affect disease progression </plain></SENT>
