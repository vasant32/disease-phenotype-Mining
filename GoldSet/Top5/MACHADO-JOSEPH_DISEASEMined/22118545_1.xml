<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) is a progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorder</z:e> caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the Huntingtin protein which results in the selective degeneration of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our group has previously demonstrated that calcium (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>) signaling is abnormal in MSNs from the yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> (YAC128) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we demonstrated that deranged intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> signaling sensitizes YAC128 MSNs to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced excitotoxicity when compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) MSNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In previous studies we also observed abnormal neuronal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> signaling in neurons from spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> 2 (SCA2) and spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) mouse models and demonstrated that treatment with dantrolene, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and clinically relevant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> signaling stabilizer, was neuroprotective in experiments with these mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to evaluate potential beneficial effects of dantrolene in experiments with YAC128 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The application of <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> resulted in increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release from intracellular stores in YAC128 MSN cultures when compared to WT MSN cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment with dantrolene protected YAC128 MSNs from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> excitotoxicty, with an effective concentration of 100 nM and above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Feeding dantrolene (5 mg/kg) twice a week to YAC128 mice between 2 months and 11.5 months of age resulted in significantly improved performance in the beam-walking and gait-walking assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological analysis revealed that long-term dantrolene feeding to YAC128 mice significantly reduced the loss of NeuN-positive striatal neurons and reduced formation of Httexp nuclear aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that deranged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> signaling plays an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data also implicate the RyanRs as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and demonstrate that RyanR inhibitors and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> signaling stabilizers such as dantrolene should be considered as potential therapeutics for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and other polyQ-expansion disorders </plain></SENT>
