<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some forms, it is clinically and pathologically characterized by neurological involvement and premature neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study explores the hypothesis that defects in DNA repair in XP may contribute to neurological involvement by destabilizing trinucleotide repeats during replication causing expansion mutations into disease producing ranges </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of trinucleotide repeat analysis of 360 single genomes from three different forms of XP showed that the size of the repeats were in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range and that there was no mitotic instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that in XP, trinucleotide repeat expansion mutations are not involved in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
