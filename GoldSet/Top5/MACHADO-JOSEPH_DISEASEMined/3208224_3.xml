<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was 39.8 (+/- 12.5) years and the duration of the disease was 9.2 (+/- 6.7) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002380'>fasciculation</z:hpo> scores correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and duration of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upper motor neuron scores failed to correlate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a follow-up study we analysed the clinical data of 46 patients two years after the first examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A paired t-test was used to compare differences between observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results are in agreement with those of the cross-section in time, suggesting a deterioration of the symptoms with the evolution of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that dynamic definition of the disease according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and duration of symptoms is preferable to subdivision into classical types </plain></SENT>
