<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of ubiquitinated <z:mp ids='MP_0004191'>neuronal intranuclear inclusions</z:mp> (NIIs) has been recognized as a neuropathological hallmark of these diseases, although the significance of NIIs in the pathogenesis remains a matter of controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a previous study of DRPLA, we proposed that intranuclear diffuse accumulation of mutant proteins is another pathological characteristic of neurones, and that the variable prevalence of this characteristic may be relevant to the variation of clinical symptoms in patients with different repeat sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, we also disclosed that polyglutamine tracts are localized in a subset of lysosomes in affected neurones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present immunohistochemical study of autopsied <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and DRPLA brains shows that the nucleus and cytoplasm of affected neurones share the subcellular distribution of expanded polyglutamine tracts, the pattern of distribution being specific to each diseased brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that in CAG-repeat diseases, mutant proteins are involved in both the ubiquitin/proteasome and endosomal/lysosomal pathways for protein degradation in different intraneuronal compartments, where their accumulation may exert distinct influences on neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
