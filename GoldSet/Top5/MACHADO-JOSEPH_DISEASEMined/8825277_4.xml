<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 46 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diseased controls were matched by age to the patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CSF level of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> was significantly elevated, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> was significantly decreased, and the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> (L/P) ratio was significantly elevated in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="30769">citric acid</z:chebi> cycle intermediates of the CSF between the patients and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured the native and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28240">dichloroacetate</z:chebi> (DCA)-activated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) activities, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> electron transport activities in 3 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, and found these activities to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002490'>increased CSF lactate</z:hpo>, increased <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio, and decreased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> may reflect the decreased regional cerebral blood flow rather than metabolic derangement of the mitochondria </plain></SENT>
