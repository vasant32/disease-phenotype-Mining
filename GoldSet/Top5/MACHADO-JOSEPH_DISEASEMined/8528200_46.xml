<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The size of the (CAG)n repeat array in the 3' end of the MJD1 gene and the haplotype at a series of microsatellite markers surrounding the MJD1 gene were examined in a large cohort of Japanese and Caucasian subjects affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our data provide five novel observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> is associated with expansion fo the array from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of 14-37 repeats to 68-84 repeats in most Japanese and Caucasian subjects, but no subjects were observed with expansions intermediate in size between those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> affected groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, the expanded allele associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> displays inter-generational instability, particularly in male meioses, and this instability was associated with the clinical phenomenon of anticipation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Third, the size of the expanded allele is not only inversely correlated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age-of-onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> (r = -0.738, p &lt; 0.001), but is also correlated with the frequency of other clinical features [e.g. pseudoexophthalmos and pyramidal signs were more frequent in subjects with large repeats (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.05 respectively)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourth, the disease phenotype is significantly more severe and had an early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> (16 years) in a subject homozygous for the expanded allele, which contrasts with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington disease</z:e> and suggests that the expanded allele in the MJD1 gene could exert its effect either by a dominant negative effect (putatively excluded in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) or by a gain of function effect as proposed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, Japanese and Caucasian subjects affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> share haplotypes at several markers surrounding the MJD1 gene, which are uncommon in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Japanese and Caucasian population, and which suggests the existence either of common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founders</z:e> in these populations or of chromosomes susceptible to pathologic expansion of the CAG repeat in the MJD1 gene </plain></SENT>
