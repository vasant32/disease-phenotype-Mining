<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 38 genetically-confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients (mean age, 52.76 ± 12.70 years; 21 males) with clinical scales and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 38 healthy subjects as a control group (mean age, 48.86 ± 12.07 years, 20 male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals underwent the same protocol for high-resolution T1 and T2 images and diffusion tensor imaging acquisition (32 directions) in a 3-T scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (FSL 4.1.4) to analyze diffusion data and SPM8/DARTEL for voxel-based morphometry of infratentorial structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T2-relaxometry of cerebellum was performed with in-house-developed software Aftervoxel and Interactive Volume Segmentation (IVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients' mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 40.02 ± 11.48 years and mean duration of disease was 9.3 ± 2.7 years </plain></SENT>
