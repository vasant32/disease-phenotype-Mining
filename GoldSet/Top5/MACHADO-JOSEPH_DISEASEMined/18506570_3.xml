<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To quantify spinal cord <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and its impact on clinical disability in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (SCA) type 3 and 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>Atrophy</z:mpath> of the upper spinal cord was assessed by high resolution T1-weighted MRI of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> (n = 14) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, two groups of age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects (n = 24,) corresponding to the two SCA groups, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Images were post-processed by a semi-automated volumetry method combining a marker based segmentation and an automatic histogram method facilitating highly reliable quantification and morphometry of the upper cervical cord in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a significant reduction of normalized mean crosssectional area of the spinal cord in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> (p &lt; 0.0005), whereas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> patients normalized mean crosssectional area was in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (p = 0.379) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between spinal cord <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and disease duration as well as CAG repeat length in both subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> a negative dependency between clinical disability, as expressed by the International Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> Rating Scale as a well established <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> score, and the mean cross-sectional area was found (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar correlation was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> but did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results quantify for the first time in vivo spinal cord <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> as a non-cerebellar neurodegenerative process in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> volumetry of the upper cervical cord as a marker of functional importance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> </plain></SENT>
