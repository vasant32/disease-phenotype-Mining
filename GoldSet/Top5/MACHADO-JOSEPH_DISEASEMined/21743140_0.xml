<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the related factors of international cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> rating scale (ICARS) and scale for the assessment and rating of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> scores (SARA) in patients with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 126 SCA3/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients were assessed by ICARS and SARA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relation between ICARS or SARA scores and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, disease duration and CAG repeat size was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Either the total ICARS or the total SARA score was positively related with the disease duration(r=0.586,P&lt;0.05;r=0.643,P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simple linear regression equations were: Y(1)(total ICARS score)=13.072+2.388 X(2)(disease duration)(F=68.874,P&lt;0.05); Y(2)(total SARA score)=4.403+ 0.961 X(2)(disease duration)(F=87.254, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Either age adjusted the total ICARS score or age adjusted the total SARA score was positively related with CAG repeat size(r=0.328, P&lt;0.05; r=0.335, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both the ICARS subscores and the SARA subscores were positively related with the disease duration(r=0.257-0.589, P&lt;0.05; r=0.432-0.623, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both age adjusted ICARS subscores and age adjusted SARA subscores were positively related with CAG repeat size(r=0.263-0.403, P&lt;0.05; r=0.189-0.366, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of variance showed that the total ICARS score and the total SARA score increased with the disease stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ICARS and SARA are both reliable and effective scales in assessing the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, and researchers can choose the most suitable scale according to specific requirement </plain></SENT>
