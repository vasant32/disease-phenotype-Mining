<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To find specific inhibitors to TGM2, two structurally diverse chemical libraries (LOPAC and Prestwick) were screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that ZM39923, a Janus kinase inhibitor, and its metabolite ZM449829 were the most potent inhibitors with IC(50) of 10 and 5 nM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, two other inhibitors, including tyrphostin 47 and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi>(3), were found to have an IC(50) in the micromolar range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These agents used in part a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi>-dependent mechanism to inhibit TGM2, consistent with the activation of TGM2 by reduction of an intramolecular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These inhibitors were tested in a polyglutamine-expressing Drosophila model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> and found to improve survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TGM2 inhibitors we discovered may serve as valuable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33585">lead compounds</z:chebi> for the development of orally active TGM2 inhibitors to treat human diseases </plain></SENT>
