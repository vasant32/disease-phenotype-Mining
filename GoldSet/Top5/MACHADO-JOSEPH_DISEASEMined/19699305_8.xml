<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We generated a mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> expressing ataxin-3 with 148 CAG repeats under the control of the huntingtin promoter, resulting in ubiquitous expression throughout the whole brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model resembles many features of the disease in humans, including a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and CAG repeat instability in transmission to offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed a biphasic progression of the disease, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> during the first months and decline of motor coordination after about 1 year of age; however, intranuclear aggregates were not visible at this age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Few and small intranuclear aggregates appeared first at the age of 18 months, further supporting the claim that neuronal dysfunction precedes the formation of intranuclear aggregates </plain></SENT>
