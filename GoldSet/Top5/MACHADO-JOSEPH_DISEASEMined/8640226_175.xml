<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, we identified a novel gene, MJD1, which contains an expanded CAG triplet repeat in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in cultured cells expressing a portion of the MJD1 gene that includes the expanded CAG repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurs only when the CAG repeat is translated into polyglutamine residues, which apparently precipitate in large covalently modified forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also created ataxic transgenic mice by expressing the expanded polyglutamine stretch in Purkinje cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate the potential involvement of the expanded polyglutamine as the common aetiological agent for inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> with CAG expansions </plain></SENT>
