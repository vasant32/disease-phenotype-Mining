<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although many of the molecular pathways regulating proteotoxic stress and longevity are well characterized, their contribution to disease susceptibility remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we describe a new Caenorhabditis elegans model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pan-neuronal expression of mutant ATXN3 leads to a polyQ-length dependent, neuron subtype-specific aggregation and neuronal dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of different neurons revealed a pattern of dorsal nerve cord and sensory neuron susceptibility to mutant ataxin-3 that was distinct from the aggregation and toxicity profiles of polyQ-alone proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This reveals that the sequences flanking the polyQ-stretch in ATXN3 have a dominant influence on cell-intrinsic neuronal factors that modulate polyQ-mediated pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aging influences the ATXN3 phenotypes which can be suppressed by the downregulation of the insulin/insulin growth factor-1-like signaling pathway and activation of heat shock factor-1 </plain></SENT>
