<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in hereditary SCA patients, we genotyped seven genetically defined dominant SCAs in 349 patients, including 266 patients from 77 families, 78 probands from unrelated families with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> SCA, and five patients in whom a family history of SCA was not demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of each disorder in a total of 155 unrelated families was 23.9% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>), 29.0% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e>, 9.7% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e>, 7.7% for SCA2, and 2.6% for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormal expansion of triplet repeats for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e> and SCA8 was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 27.1% of the patients had still unknown SCA mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the GAA repeat in the frataxin gene was not abnormally expanded in 13 early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> SCA patients with clinical features similar to those of Friedreich <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of our results with those from other centers handling SCA showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> is prevalent throughout Japan, but the frequencies of other dominant SCAs differ considerably even within Japan </plain></SENT>
