<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004191'>neuronal intranuclear inclusions</z:mp> (NIIs) and neuronal mosaicism has been described in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo> (SCA), but their implication in neurodegenerative mechanisms still remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> and NIIs, and the size of CAG triplet expansion in selected areas of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> in two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Postmortem neuropathological study was carried out, and the regional distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> was compared with NIIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CAG expansion was analysed by PCR amplification in the same regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> was seen in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, pontine nuclei and motor nuclei of the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moderate neurone loss was found in the locus ceruleus, colliculus and substantia nigra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Loss of granule and Purkinje cells was found in the cerebellum, mainly in the vermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NIIs were present in neurones of the involved nuclei of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, medulla oblongata and pons, but not in the locus ceruleus, substantia nigra and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A few NIIs were found in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of CAG repeats was 27/70 in the first patient and 21/74 in the second patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The variation of the expanded allele size among different cerebral areas was +/-1-3 CAG repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The partial correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> and NIIs suggests that other factors distinct from NII formation may be involved in the neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the low degree of mosaicism between regions without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> and regions with marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> points to the existence of selective cellular vulnerability to the genetic defect </plain></SENT>
