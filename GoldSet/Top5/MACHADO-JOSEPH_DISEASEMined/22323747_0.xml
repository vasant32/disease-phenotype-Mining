<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with genetically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> were randomly assigned to receive either varenicline (4 weeks for titration and 4 weeks at a dose of 1 mg twice daily) or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included changes in the Scale for the Rating and Assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> (SARA) scores at endpoint (8 weeks) compared with baseline, a timed 25-foot walk and 9-hole peg test, measurements of mood and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> (mean age = 51 ± 10.98 years; mean disease duration = 14 ± 9.82 years; mean SARA score = 16.13 ± 4.67) were enrolled in the study, and data on 18 patients were analyzed in period I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common side effect associated with varenicline was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improvements were noted in the SARA subsections for gait (p = 0.04), stance (p = 0.03), rapid alternating movements (p = 0.003), and timed 25-foot walk (p = 0.05) and Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory scores (p = 0.03) in patients taking varenicline compared with those taking placebo at endpoint, with a trend toward improvement in the SARA total score (p = 0.06) in the varenicline group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this controlled study, varenicline significantly improved axial symptoms and rapid alternating movements in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> as measured by SARA subscores and was fairly well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that varenicline improved the axial functions of gait, stance, and timed 25-foot walk but did not improve appendicular function, except for rapid alternating movements, in adult patients with genetically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>
