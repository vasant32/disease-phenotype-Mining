<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that the CAG expansion caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> in a Yemenite Jewish family and demonstrated that most of the clinical variation among members of this family was due to the genotype of the affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients who presented with an early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (25 years) and severe disorder were found to be homozygous for the CAG expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 5 heterozygotes for the CAG expansion older than 40 years, one had neurological symptoms from the age of 45, while the others were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one of the heterozygotes, no neurological symptoms were present when last examined at the age of 66 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Homozygosity for the MJD1 mutation was the main cause of variability in this large family, however, other factors clearly played a role in the expression of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We could demonstrate that homozygote sibs with similar expansion in both alleles had significant differences in disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gender did not affect the clinical expression in this family </plain></SENT>
