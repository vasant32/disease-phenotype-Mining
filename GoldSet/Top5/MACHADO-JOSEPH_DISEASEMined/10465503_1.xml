<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The number of repeats ranged from 14 to 47 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles and from 61 to 84 in disease-associated alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most frequent and lowest number of repeats was 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The size distribution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MJD1 alleles did not fit a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distribution curve, but was tetramodal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeats from 14 to 17, 18 to 23, 24 to 25, and 26 to 47 units were designated groups A through D, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When examined Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by chi-square analysis of goodness of fit: no evidence of significant deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed [x2=4.248&lt;16.919 (P=0.05), df=9] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed distribution peak of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MJD1 alleles corresponding to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> containing 10, 15, 20, and 24 glutamine suggests that stretches of 5 and 10 glutamine might constitute a functional domain of human MJD1 </plain></SENT>
