<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue from both OPCA and AD impregnated positively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurons, astroglia and oligodendroglia in the putamen, pontine nucleus and inferior olivary nucleus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> impregnated in addition to white matter oligodendroglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuronal inclusions in the pontine nucleus appeared as compact or fibrillary masses, and GCI-bearing oligodendroglia and astrocytes showed homogeneously impregnated somata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The myelinated pontocerebellar tract and the white matter surrounding the inferior olivary nucleus contained a small number of impregnated nerve fibres with a hollow structure, which resembled the myelin sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical studies to clarify these argyrophilic structures in the OPCA subjects employed paired helical filament (PHF), microtubule associated proteins (MAPs), MAP1, MAP2, MAP5, tau, ubiquitin, neurofilament (200 or 70 kilodaltons) and myelin basic protein (MBP) antisera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GCI-bearing white matter oligodendroglia expressed PHF, tau, MAP5 and ubiquitin immunoreactives and non-argyrophilic astroglia were positive for MAP5 antiserum alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the putamen, pontine nuclei and inferior olivary nuclei, impregnated neurons as well as the GCI-bearing oligodendroglia immunostained with PHF, tau, MAP5 and ubiquitin antisera and impregnated astroglia were also immunoreactive to these antisera except for being tau negative in the putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Silver impregnated nerve fibres showed only MBP immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the argyrophilia in the OPCA subjects closely correlates with PHF and tau immunoreactivities </plain></SENT>
