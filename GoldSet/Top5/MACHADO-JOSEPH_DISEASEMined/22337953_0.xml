<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a -1 bp frameshift occurring within an (exp)CAG repeat would henceforth lead to translation from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e> frame, generating polyalanine stretches instead of polyglutamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results show that transgenic expression of (exp)CAG ATXN3 led to -1 frameshifting events, which have deleterious effects in Drosophila and mammalian neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, transgenic expression of polyglutamine-encoding (exp)CAA ATXN3 was not toxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, (exp)CAG ATXN3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> does not contribute per se to the toxicity observed in our models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our observations indicate that expanded polyglutamine tracts in Drosophila and mouse neurons are insufficient for the development of a phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence, we propose that -1 ribosomal frameshifting contributes to the toxicity associated with (exp)CAG repeats </plain></SENT>
