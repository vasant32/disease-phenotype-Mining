<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to report transcranial brain sonography findings in a sample of clinically and molecularly proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> patients and to compare these data against those of an age- and gender-matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cross-sectional study on transcranial brain sonography was conducted in 30 Machado-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Joseph disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial brain sonography was performed by an experienced sonographer blinded to the clinical, genetic, and neuroimaging data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those of a control group of 44 healthy subjects matched for age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sonographic findings were also correlated with clinical features and genetic data in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher frequency of substantia nigra and lenticular nucleus hyperechogenicity was found in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> group compared to an age- and gender-matched healthy control group (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The substantia nigra echogenic area proved to be the best predictor for differentiating cases from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Third and lateral ventricles were significantly larger in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> patients than in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations were found between transcranial brain sonography findings and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> demographic/clinical data </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity occurred frequently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> patients and was found to be the best predictor for differentiating cases from controls </plain></SENT>
