<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this work we investigate subcellular localization and proteolytic cleavage of different forms of ataxin-3 (AT-3), the protein responsible for spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> (AT-3Q6 and AT-3Q26) and pathological (AT-3Q72) ataxins-3, as well as two truncated forms lacking poly-Q, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Full-length proteins were also expressed as C14A mutants, in order to assess whether AT-3 autoproteolytic activity was involved in its fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological proteins localized in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, as expected, but also in the mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microsequencing showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ataxins-3 underwent the same proteolytic cleavage, removing the first 27 amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, while <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ataxins were further cleaved at a number of caspase sites, pathological AT-3 was proteolyzed to a much lesser extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This may play a role in the pathogenesis, hampering degradation of aggregation-prone expanded AT-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, autolytic cleavage was apparently not involved in AT-3 proteolysis </plain></SENT>
