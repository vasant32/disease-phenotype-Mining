<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene on the long arm of chromosome 14 has been identified as the pathological mutation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While investigating the distribution of CAG repeat lengths of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene in Taiwan's population, we have identified 18 MJD-affected patients and 12 at-risk individuals in seven families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have analyzed the range of CAG repeat lengths in 96 control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CAG repeat number ranged from 13 to 44 in the controls and 72-85 in the affected and at-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that the CAG repeat number was inversely correlated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The differences in CAG repeat length between parent and child and between siblings are greater with paternal transmission than maternal transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data show a tendency towards the phenomenon of anticipation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> families but do not support unidirectional expansion of CAG repeats during transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that PCR amplification of the CAG repeats in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene from villous DNA was possible and might prove useful as a diagnostic tool for affected families in the future </plain></SENT>
