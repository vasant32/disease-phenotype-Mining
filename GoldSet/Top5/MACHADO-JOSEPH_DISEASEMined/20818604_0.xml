<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine if muscle energy metabolism, as measured by (31)P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), is a metabolic marker for the efficacy of treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We obtained (31)P-MRS in the calf muscle of 8 male patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and 11 healthy men before, during, and after a 4 minute plantar flexion exercise in a supine position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data showed that there was a significant difference between the groups in terms of the PCr/(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> + PCr) ratio at rest (P = 0.03) and the maximum rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP production (V(max)) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, V(max) was inversely correlated with the scale for the assessment and rating of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> score (r = -0.34, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> group also showed a reduction in V(max) over the course of 2 years (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that this noninvasive measurement of muscle energy metabolism may represent a surrogate marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
