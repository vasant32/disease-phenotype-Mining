<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of a sperm typing study performed in patients of Japanese descent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>), it was reported that disease alleles are preferentially transmitted during meiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a sperm typing study of five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients of French descent and analysis of the pooled data shows a ratio of mutant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles of 379:436 (46.5:53.5%), which does not support meiotic segregation distortion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To confirm these results, sperm typing analysis was also performed using a polymorphic marker, D14S1050, closely linked to the MJD1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 910 sperm analyzed, the allele linked to the disease chromosome was detected in 50.3% of the samples and the allele linked to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome was found in 49.6% of the sperm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference in frequency of these two alleles is not significant ( P = 0.8423) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Likelihood-based analysis of segregation distortion in the single sperm data using the SPERMSEG program also showed no support for segregation distortion at the gamete level in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The previous report on the Japanese patients also suggested that disease allele stability may be influenced by a trans effect of an intragenic polymorphism (987 G/C) in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the French patients were heterozygous for this polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, analysis of the variance in repeat number in sperm from the French <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients overlapped significantly with the variance in repeat number observed in the C/C homozygous Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
