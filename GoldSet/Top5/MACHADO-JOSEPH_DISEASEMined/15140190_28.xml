<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polyglutamine disorders are characterized by disease protein misfolding and aggregation; often within the nuclei of affected neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the precise mechanism of polyglutamine-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> remains elusive, evidence suggests that proteolysis of polyglutamine disease proteins by caspases contributes to pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using cellular models we now show that the endogenous spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type-3 disease protein, ataxin-3, is proteolyzed in apoptotic paradigms, resulting in the loss of full-length ataxin-3 and the corresponding appearance of an approximately 28-kDa fragment containing the glutamine repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors block ataxin-3 proteolysis and studies suggest that caspase-1 is a primary mediator of cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Site-directed mutagenesis experiments eliminating three, six or nine potential caspase cleavage sites in the protein suggest redundancy in the site(s) at which cleavage can occur, as previously described for other disease proteins; but also map a major cleavage event to a cluster of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32471">aspartate residues</z:chebi> within the ubiquitin-binding domain of ataxin-3 near the polyglutamine tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, caspase-mediated cleavage of expanded ataxin-3 resulted in increased ataxin-3 aggregation, suggesting a potential role for caspase-mediated proteolysis in spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type-3 pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
