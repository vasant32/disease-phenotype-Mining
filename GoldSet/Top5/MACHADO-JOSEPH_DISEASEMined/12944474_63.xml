<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated if ataxin-3 was a proteasome-associated factor that recognized ubiquitinated substrates based on the rationale that (i) it is present with proteasome subunits and ubiquitin in cellular inclusions, (ii) it interacts with human Rad23, a protein that may translocate proteolytic substrates to the proteasome, and (iii) it shares regions of sequence similarity with the proteasome subunit S5a, which can recognize multiubiquitinated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report that ataxin-3 interacts with ubiquitinated proteins, can bind the proteasome, and, when the gene harbors an expanded repeat length, can interfere with the degradation of a well-characterized test substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, ataxin-3 associates with the ubiquitin- and proteasome-binding factors Rad23 and valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97), findings that support the hypothesis that ataxin-3 is a proteasome-associated factor that mediates the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins </plain></SENT>
