<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relatively little is known about the structural and functional properties of ataxin-3, and only recently have these aspects of the protein begun to be explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have performed a preliminary investigation into the conserved N-terminal domain of ataxin-3, termed Josephin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that Josephin is a monomeric domain which folds into a globular conformation and possesses ubiquitin protease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we demonstrate that the presence of the polyglutamine region of the protein does not alter the structure of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, its presence destabilizes the Josephin domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The implications of these data in the pathogenesis of polyglutamine repeat proteins are discussed </plain></SENT>
