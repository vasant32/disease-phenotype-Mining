<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten had juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> (JP; <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> before age 21 years) and 139 had young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> (YOPD; <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at age 21 to 40 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Included were 60 patients originally reported 10 years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of the JP group had a positive family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> in a first-degree relative, and clinical presentation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality risk was threefold that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the YOPD group, the mortality risk was double that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poor initial response to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15765">L-dopa</z:chebi> was a risk factor for early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two previously reported patients, the diagnosis had been changed to multiple system <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a median disease duration of 18 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was found in only 19% of YOPD patients (13% of those younger than 60 years and 43% of those 60 years or older) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age was the most important factor for development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but female sex and positive family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> also had more modest predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After a disease duration of 10 years or less, only 5% of patients were experiencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> and 30% freezing, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had developed <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15765">L-dopa</z:chebi>-related fluctuations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100660'>dyskinesias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that the mortality rate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> starting before the age of 40 is increased in comparison to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population and is similar to the general <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intellectual function and postural reflexes are usually well preserved for many years despite a long history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> and the early and frequent occurrence of treatment complications, provided the patients remain biologically and chronologically young </plain></SENT>
