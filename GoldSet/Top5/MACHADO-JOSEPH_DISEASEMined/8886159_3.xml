<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of multipoint linkage analysis as well as detection of critical recombination events indicate that the gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> is localized in a 4-cM region between D14S280-D14S81 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found strong linkage disequilibria at AFM343vf1 and D14S81, and association of a few common haplotypes with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that there is an obvious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect in Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> and suggest the possibility of the existence of predisposing haplotypes which are prone to expansions of CAG repeats </plain></SENT>
