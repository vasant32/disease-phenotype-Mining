<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The distribution of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptors was measured by radionuclide imaging (SPECT) after intravenous administration of 123I-iomazenil (Ro 16-0154) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SPECT demonstrated decreased binding throughout the cerebral cortex and cerebellum in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Binding potential (receptor concentration x affinity) was diffusely decreased in cerebral cortex, thalamus, striatum and cerebellum compared with control subjects, suggesting that GABAergic function may be decreased globally in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was largely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cerebral cortical atrophy</z:hpo> was evident on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">Iodine</z:chebi>-123-iomazenil SPECT may become a potent method for detecting impairment of the cerebral cortex even before brain perfusion SPECT or MRI can reveal early abnormalities </plain></SENT>
