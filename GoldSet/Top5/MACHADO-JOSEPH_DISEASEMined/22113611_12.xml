<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proteolytic liberation of highly aggregation-prone polyQ fragments from the protective sequence of the MJD1 gene product ataxin 3 (ATXN3) has been proposed to trigger the formation of ATXN3-containing aggregates, the neuropathological hallmark of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ATXN3 fragments are detected in brain tissue of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients and transgenic mice expressing mutant human ATXN3(Q71), and their amount increases with disease severity, supporting a relationship between ATXN3 processing and disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The formation of early aggregation intermediates is thought to have a critical role in disease initiation, but the precise pathogenic mechanism operating in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> has remained elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29988">L-glutamate</z:chebi>-induced excitation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons initiates Ca(2+)-dependent proteolysis of ATXN3 followed by the formation of <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-insoluble aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This phenotype could be abolished by calpain inhibition, confirming a key role of this protease in ATXN3 aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aggregate formation was further dependent on functional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels as well as ionotropic and voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, and was not observed in iPSCs, fibroblasts or glia, thereby providing an explanation for the neuron-specific phenotype of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data illustrate that iPSCs enable the study of aberrant protein processing associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> in patient-specific neurons </plain></SENT>
