<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western blot with a transgenic mouse expressing mutant ataxin-1 showed the increase of SUMOylated proteins in the cerebellar cortex, which we named ESCA1 and ESCA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results indicated activation of SUMO-1 system in polyglutamine diseases and predicted its involvement in the pathology </plain></SENT>
