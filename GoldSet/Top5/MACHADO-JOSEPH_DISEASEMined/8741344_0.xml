<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP)-like immunoreactivity has been demonstrated to be present in nerve terminals around the sweat glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that CGRP modulates the cholinergic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to evaluate the locally administrated CGRP on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> of patients with multiple system <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (MSA) and hereditary spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (HSCA) consisting of 10 males and 11 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 9 HSCA, 3 was diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> by clinical and DNA diagnostic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CGRP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50142">methacholine chloride</z:chebi> (MCH) was dissolved in saline solution to specified concentration, and 0.1ml of which was injected intradermally at the center of a forearm test area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sweat rate was recorded continuously by the capacitance hygrometry in a relatively cool environment in which the spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CGRP significantly increased the sweat rate when it was administrated with MCH on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a clear dose-dependent relationship between the dose of CGRP and its enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This enhancement was significantly reduced in patients with MSA as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, most of HSCA showed no remarkable impairment of CGRP enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that peptidergic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> is extensively affected in patients with MSA but is not in patients with HSCA, which may be the consequence of peptidergic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> dysfunction in MSA </plain></SENT>
