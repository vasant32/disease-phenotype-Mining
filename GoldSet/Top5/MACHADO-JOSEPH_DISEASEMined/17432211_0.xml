<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insoluble aggregates of polyglutamine-containing proteins in neurons, which are usually conjugated with ubiquitin, are a hallmark of the polyglutamine diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanism underlying the ubiquitylation and aggregate formation of polyglutamine-containing proteins has been largely unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report the identification of critical factors involved in the ubiquitylation process as well as turnover of MJD1/Ataxin-3 protein, in which the abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine tract is responsible for spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, also known as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>E4 B/UFD2a (a ubiquitin chain assembly factor) and VCP (a AAA-family ATPase) were co-purified with the activity polyubiquitylating Ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>E4B mediated polyubiquitylation of MJD1/Ataxin-3, and VCP interacted with both E 4B and MJD1 Ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a Drosophila model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, expression of E4B suppressed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> induced by an Ataxin-3 mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that E4 is a rate-limiting factor in the degradation of proteins with expanded polyglutamine tracts </plain></SENT>
