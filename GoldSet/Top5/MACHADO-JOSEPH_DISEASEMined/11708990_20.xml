<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Direct detection of the gene mutation allows for the confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>), the most frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To address the main difficulties in our national <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> predictive testing program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first was the emergence of intermediate alleles, for which it is not yet possible to determine whether they will cause disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second was the issue of homoallelism, ie, homozygosity for 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles with exactly the same (CAG)(n) length, which occurs in about 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A large pedigree with 1 affected patient carrying a 71 and a 51 CAG repeat and 2 asymptomatic relatives carrying the 51 CAG repeat and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-size alleles underwent clinical and molecular studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intragenic haplotypes for these alleles were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A representative sample of the healthy population in the region was obtained to assess the distribution of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (CAG)(n) length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We established the genotype for 4 intragenic polymorphisms in the gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> (MJD1) in 21 homoallelic individuals, to distinguish their 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, we developed a new Southern blot method to completely exclude cases of nonamplification of expanded alleles in the homoallelic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study of the family in which the 51 CAG repeat was found suggests that the allele is apparently not associated with disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These intermediate alleles were not present in a large sample of the healthy population from the same region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intragenic polymorphisms allowed distinction of the 2 different <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of homoallelism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The absence of an expanded allele was also confirmed by Southern blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We propose an improved protocol for molecular testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These strategies, developed to overcome the practical difficulties mostly in the presymptomatic and prenatal diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, should prove useful for other polyglutamine-related disorders </plain></SENT>
