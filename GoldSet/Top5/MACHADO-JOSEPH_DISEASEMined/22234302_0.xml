<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy we previously showed that a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (AT3Q24) and an expanded (AT3Q55) variant were capable of evolving into oligomers and protofibrils at 37 °C, whereas only the expanded form generated irreversibly aggregated fibrils that also were associated with a network of side-chain glutamine hydrogen bonding [Natalello et al </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here that AT3Q24, when gradually heated up to 85 °C, undergoes aggregation similar to that observed at 37 °C; in contrast, AT3Q55 only generates large, amorphous aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose a possible interpretation of the mechanism by which temperature affects the outcome of fibrillogenesis </plain></SENT>
