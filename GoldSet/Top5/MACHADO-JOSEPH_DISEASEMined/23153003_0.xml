<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 47 testees of Azorean origin (23 from the island of Flores and 24 from S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Miguel) that completed the fourth evaluation session of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> protocol, and undertook a neurological examination at the moment of participation in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nearly 50% of testees were symptomatic at the time of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Psychological well-being of the 47 participants was evaluated using the Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The family satisfaction scale by adjectives was applied to obtain information on family dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average PGWB score of the total participants was of 73.3, a value indicative of psychological well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nearly half of the testees presented scores indicating psychological well-being, whereas scores indicating moderate (28.9%) or severe (23.7%) stress were found in the remaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average score in the PGWB scale was lower in symptomatic than in asymptomatic subjects; moreover, the distinct distribution of the well-being categories seen in the two groups shows an impact of the appearance of first symptoms on the psychological state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Motives for undertaking the test, provided 5 years prior, failed to show an impact in well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average score for familial satisfaction was of 134, a value compatible with high familial satisfaction, which represented the most frequent category (59.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results demonstrate that well-being and family satisfaction need to be monitored in confirmed carriers of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of acceptance studies, after PT, as well as the development of acceptance training actions, should be of major importance to anticipate the possibility of psychological damage </plain></SENT>
