<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) or Spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 is caused by a polyglutamine-encoding CAG expansion in the ATXN3 gene, which encodes a 42 kDa deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated ataxin-3 deubiquitinating activity and the functional relevance of ataxin-3 interactions with two proteins previously described to interact with ataxin-3, hHR23A and valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We confirmed ataxin-3 affinity for both hHR23A and VCP/p97 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>hHR23A and ataxin-3 were shown to co-localize in discrete nuclear foci, while VCP/p97 was primarily cytoplasmic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>hHR23A and VCP/p97 recombinant proteins were added, separately or together, to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and expanded ataxin-3 in in vitro deubiquitination assays to evaluate their influence on ataxin-3 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VCP/p97 was shown to be an activator specifically of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> ataxin-3, exhibiting no effect on expanded ataxin-3, In contrast, we observed no significant alterations in ataxin-3 enzyme kinetics or substrate preference in the presence of hHR23A alone or in combination with VCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on our results we propose a model where ataxin-3 normally functions with its interactors to specify the cellular fate of ubiquitinated proteins </plain></SENT>
