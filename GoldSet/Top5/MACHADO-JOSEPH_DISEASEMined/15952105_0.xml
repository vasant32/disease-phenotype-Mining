<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Yeast two-hybrid screen (MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3) and regular molecular biologic techniques were undertaken to screen human brain cDNA library with mutant ataxin-3 bait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two baits from both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant C-terminus of ataxin-3 were created by subcloned methods to determine which domain of ataxin-3 interacts with the putative associated proteins and to find out optimal candidate proteins that interact with C-terminus of ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Confocal microscope was used to observe whether ataxin-3 co-localized with the obtained interacting proteins in mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five novel ataxin-3 interacting proteins were obtained, among which were three known proteins, namely human rhodopsin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> dissociation inhibitor alpha, small ubiquitin-like modifier 1, and human neuronal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2639">amiloride</z:chebi>-sensitive <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> channel 2; the other two were unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interacting domain analysis revealed that an unknown protein interacted with the C-terminus near the polyglutamine tract of ataxin-3, the other four <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> interacted with the N-terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the nucleus of SH-SY5Y cell, small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 co-localized with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> ataxin-3 and with the intranuclear aggregates formed by the mutant ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An unknown protein probably interacting with C-terminus of ataxin-3 is firstly discovered, and the initiative findings suggest first that the interaction of small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 with N-terminus of ataxin-3 and the relevant sumoylation probably participate in the post-translation modifying of ataxin-3 and in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
