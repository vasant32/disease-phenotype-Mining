<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that such a motif consisting of four basic amino acids in the polyglutamine protein ataxin-3 (Atx-3) serves as a recognition site for the interaction with the molecular chaperone VCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Through this interaction, VCP modulates the fibrillogenesis of pathogenic forms of Atx-3 in a concentration-dependent manner, with low concentrations of VCP stimulating fibrillogenesis and excess concentrations suppressing it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No such effect was observed with a mutant Atx-3 variant, which does not contain a functional VCP interaction motif </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, a stretch of four basic amino acids in the ubiquitin chain assembly factor E4B was also discovered to be critical for VCP binding, indicating that arginine/lysine-rich motifs might be generally utilized by VCP for the targeting of proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo studies with Drosophila models confirmed that VCP selectively modulates aggregation and neurotoxicity induced by pathogenic Atx-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, these results define the VCP-Atx-3 association as a potential target for therapeutic intervention and suggest that it might influence the progression of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
