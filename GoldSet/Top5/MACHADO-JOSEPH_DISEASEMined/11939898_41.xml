<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ten <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> characterized by spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (SCA) are known to be caused by trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in some instances the molecular diagnosis is considered indeterminate because of the overlap between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and affected allele ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the mechanism that generates expanded alleles is not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical and molecular characteristics of a large group of Portuguese and Brazilian families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> to improve knowledge of the molecular diagnosis of SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have (1) assessed repeat sizes at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known TNR loci implicated in SCA; (2) determined frequency distributions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles and expansions; and (3) looked at genotype-phenotype correlations in 202 unrelated Portuguese and Brazilian patients with SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of TNR expansions was performed using polymerase chain reaction amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients from 110 unrelated families with SCA showed TNR expansions at 1 of the loci studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dominantly transmitted cases had (CAG)(n) expansions at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> gene (MJD1) (63%), at SCA2 (3%), the gene for dentatorubropallidoluysian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (DRPLA) (2%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> (1%), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e> (1%) loci, or (CTG)(n) expansions at the SCA8 (2%) gene, whereas (GAA)(n) expansions in the Freidreich <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> gene (FRDA) were found in 64% of families with recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Isolated patients also had TNR expansions at the MJD1 (6%), SCA8 (6%), or FRDA (8%) genes; in addition, an expanded allele at the TATA-binding protein gene (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi>), with 43 CAGs, was present in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>mental deterioration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Associations between frequencies of SCA2 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> and a frequency of large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles were found in Portuguese and Brazilian individuals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, no association between the frequencies of DRPLA and large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles was found in the Portuguese group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that (1) a significant number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>isolated cases</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> are due to TNR expansions; (2) expanded DRPLA alleles in Portuguese families may have evolved from an ancestral haplotype; and (3) small (CAG)(n) expansions at the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> gene may cause SCA17 </plain></SENT>
