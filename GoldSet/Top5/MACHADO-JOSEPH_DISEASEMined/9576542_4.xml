<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate these changes in asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> gene carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> gene carriers, identified using a molecular test, and 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects were recruited for PET studies using FDG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional uptake ratios of FDG were calculated from the radioactivity of the cerebellar hemispheres, brainstem, and the temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, divided by the activity in the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with data obtained from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects, there was significantly decreased FDG utilisation in the cerebellar hemispheres, brainstem, and occipital cortex, and increased FDG metabolism in the parietal and temporal cortices of asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> gene carriers, suggesting preclinical disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Discriminant analysis of regional FDG uptake correctly classified genetic status (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> mutation carriers v mutation negative subjects) in 25 of 25 subjects (100% sensitivity and 100% specificity), and clinical status (asymptomatic mutation carriers v symptomatic patients) in 14 of 15 subjects (100% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Subclinical changes of FDG consumption, as measured by noninvasive PET, can act as an objective marker of preclinical disease activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
