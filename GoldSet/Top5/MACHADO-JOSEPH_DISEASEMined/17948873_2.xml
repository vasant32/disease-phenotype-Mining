<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In one of these diseases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>), the sex of transmitting progenitor and the C(987)GG/G(987)GG polymorphism are the best studied factors acting on intergenerational instability of expanded alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we assessed the influence of other cis and inter-allelic acting factors, at the ATXN3 locus, through the analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> lineages, flanking STR-based haplotypes, the initial repeat size and parental age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 100 transmissions of the expanded <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> allele were analyzed according to the sex of the transmitting parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have shown that independent origin mutations (identified by intragenic SNP-based haplotypes) behave differently, as the status of instability (contraction, no change or further expansion) is concerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, 72% of expansions were associated to the worldwide spread TTACAC lineage, whereas the GTGGCA displayed 75% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> contractions observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analysis of flanking recombinant haplotypes did not suggest any further distant cis elements acting up- or downstream the ATXN3 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Considering the increased amplitude of expansions seen in older transmitting fathers, a repair-based mechanism may be suggested for the meiotic instability at this locus; furthermore, the lack of correlation between the initial repeat size and degree of instability did not support a replication-based mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, our findings point to different mechanisms of instability underlying male and female meioses, as well as contraction and expansion processes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
