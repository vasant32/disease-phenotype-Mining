<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the course of the disease, we generated transgenic mice for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> using full-length ataxin-3 constructs containing 15, 70, or 148 CAG repeats, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Control mice (15 CAGs) were phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and had no neuropathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, mice transgenic for ataxin-3 with expanded polyglutamine repeats were severely affected by a strong neurological phenotype with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo>, behavioral deficits, strongly reduced motor and exploratory activity, a <z:mp ids='MP_0000160'>hunchback</z:mp>, and premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 3 to 6 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological examination by immunohistochemical staining revealed ubiquitin- and ataxin-3-positive intranuclear inclusion bodies in a multitude of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Directing ataxin-3 with 148 CAGs to the nucleus revealed an even more pronounced phenotype with more inclusions and earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, whereas mice transgenic with the same construct but attached to a nuclear export signal developed a milder phenotype with less inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that nuclear localization of ataxin-3 is required for the manifestation of symptoms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
