<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To analyse the pathogenic mechanisms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, we have generated ataxin-3-expressing rat mesencephalic CSM14.1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these cells, a post-mitotic neuronal phenotype is induced by temperature shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The isolated stable cell lines provided high level expression of non-expanded (Q23) or expanded (Q70) human full-length ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSM14.1 cells expressing the expanded full-length ataxin-3 developed nuclear inclusion bodies, strong indentations of the nuclear envelope and cytoplasmic vacuolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These ultrastructural alterations were present prior to a significantly decreased viability of neuronally differentiated cells expressing expanded ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed spontaneous cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> did not correlate with formation of intranuclear inclusions and was not apoptotic by ultrastructural analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No increased susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was found for the expanded or non-expanded ataxin-3-expressing cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data show that high level expression of expanded full-length ataxin-3 in a neuron-like cell line generates ultrastructural alterations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> pathogenesis and results in increased spontaneous non-apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
