<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiologic and histologic alterations of the peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> have rarely been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The peripheral nerves of four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> who were identified by polymerase chain reaction were subjected to electrophysiologic testing and histologic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlation analyses were made between clinical parameters and the electrophysiologic as well as histologic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Electrophysiologic studies demonstrated a marked reduction of sensory action potential, as well as a decrease in the compound motor action potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy of the sural nerves revealed marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0003380'>loss of myelinated fibers</z:hpo>, and morphometry studies showed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003387'>loss of large myelinated fibers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The severity of these pathologic changes was not related to the duration of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, the peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system was frequently affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings were similar to those seen in Friedreich's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, suggesting a loss of sensory and motor fibers probably following a lesion of the dorsal root ganglion and the anterior horns in the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
