<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the DAT activity in asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> (aMJD) gene carriers, we performed this prospective study using (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 ([(99m)Tc][2[[2-[[[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-8-azabicyclo[3,2,1]oct-2-yl]-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>](2-mercaptoethyl)amino]ethyl]amino]<z:chebi fb="6" ids="6015">ethane</z:chebi>-thiolato(3-)<z:chebi fb="31" ids="30226">-N2</z:chebi>,N2',S2,S2]oxo-[1R-(exo-exo)])) brain SPECT on 5 aMJD gene carriers, 10 age-matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients, and 10 age-matched healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Brain SPECT images were acquired 4 h after intravenous injection of 925 MBq (25 mCi) (99m)Tc-T RODAT-1, which is known to bind specifically to the DAT on the nigrostriatal terminals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By fusing these SPECT images with a striatal atlas, obtained from MRI, binding of this tracer in the entire striatum was measured and the uptake values in bilateral striatal areas were compared between these 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The uptake values of the aMJD gene carriers (P &lt; 0.001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients (P &lt; 0.001) displayed a significant reduction compared with those of the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reduction was more severe in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patient group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bilateral putamen-to-caudate ratios were significantly lower in the aMJD gene carrier and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patient groups (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> neuronal activity, as represented by the tracer binding, was more prominently affected in the putamen in these patients and gene carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 brain SPECT is capable of detecting early alteration of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> neurons in the striatal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly, the results suggest that this impairment of presynaptic <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> function actually occurs at an early stage, which was previously unrecognized in these aMJD gene carriers </plain></SENT>
