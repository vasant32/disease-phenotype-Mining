<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the influence of NII formation on intranuclear substructures, we investigated the relationship of NIIs with nuclear bodies in brains of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both diseases, promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> protein, a major component of the promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> protein nuclear bodies, altered the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distribution and was rearranged around NII, forming a single capsular structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrated that NIIs were present in close contact with coiled bodies, a highly dynamic domain that may be involved in the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preferential association of intranuclear polyglutamine aggregates with coiled bodies was also confirmed in the dentatorubral-pallidoluysian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> transgenic mouse brain and culture cells expressing mutant atrophin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the interaction between NIIs and nuclear bodies may play a role in the pathogenesis of CAG repeat diseases </plain></SENT>
