<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3 binds ubiquitylated proteins and acts as a deubiquitylating enzyme in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was previously proposed that ataxin-3, along with the VCP/p97 protein, escorts ubiquitylated substrates for proteasomal degradation, although other players of this escort complex were not identified yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this work, we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans ataxin-3 protein (ATX-3) interacts with both VCP/p97 worm homologs, CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2 and we map the interaction domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe a motility defect in both ATX-3 and CDC-48.1 mutants and, in addition, we identify a new protein interactor, UBXN-5, potentially an adaptor of the CDC-48-ATX-3 escort complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CDC-48 binds to both ATX-3 and UBXN-5 in a non-competitive manner, suggesting the formation of a trimolecular complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both CDC-48 and ATX-3, but not UBXN-5, were able to bind K-48 polyubiquitin chains, the standard signal for proteasomal degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we describe several common interactors of ATX-3 and UBXN-5, some of which can be in vivo targets of this complex </plain></SENT>
