<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Light- and electronmicroscopic immunohistochemistry was performed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> tissues derived from five patients from unrelated families with genetically confirmed diagnosis, and six individuals without a history of neurological or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NI were found almost exclusively in brain regions that also showed neuronal cell loss, i.e. in pons and dentate nucleus neurons, rarely in putamen and thalamus, but not in cerebral or cerebellar cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NI displayed an irregular surface and were mostly attached to the nucleoli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis of NI in the pons revealed an inverse relation of NI and cell loss, i.e. patients with more severe neuronal cell loss had a smaller proportion of neurons with NI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, formation of NI is not necessarily an indicator of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> but could exert a protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found increased expression of IL-1beta, IL-1ra, IL-6 and C/EBPdelta only in pons and dentate nucleus neurons and both in neurons with and without NI, suggesting that NI are not a prerequisite for transcriptional changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the selectively affected neuronal populations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> undergo a complex alteration of gene expression independent from the formation of NI </plain></SENT>
