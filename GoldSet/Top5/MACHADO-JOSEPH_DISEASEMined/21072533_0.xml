<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-two patients were retrospectively evaluated; 17 (13.9%) presented lower urinary tract dysfunction, 10 of them were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average age was 41.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urgency was found in 15 patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> in nine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The urodynamic study showed detrusor overactivity in eight patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001284'>areflexia</z:hpo> in one, and four with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> detrusor contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bladder sensitivity was abnormal in six, bladder capacity was decreased in one, urine flow decreased in 13, post-voiding residue was greater than 100 ml in nine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We could not find sphincter <z:hpo ids='HP_0010867'>dyssynergia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> (CAG) repetition was higher in patients with abnormal detrusor contraction (89.9) than in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> urodynamics (68.2) (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical significance when comparing the averages of replicates for people with and without urgency <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> (p = 0.27 and p = 0.5, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of lower urinary tract dysfunction in patients with MJ disease was around 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The urodynamic study showed predominance of detrusor overactivity and urgency as the most common symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found an association between the total number of CAG repetitions and changes in detrusor contractility </plain></SENT>
