<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the laryngeal function from the viewpoints of fiberoptic laryngoscopy and laryngeal myopathology and then attempted to clarify the difference of the mechanism of VCP among the patients with spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 1 (SCA 1), type 3 (SCA 3), and MSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with SCA 1, nineteen with SCA 3, and eleven with MSA were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vocal cord movement was analyzed by fiberoptic laryngoscopy during wakefulness and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi>-induced sleep (sleep load test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Paraffin-embedded sections or cryosections of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles from five autopsied cases (one with SCA 1 and four with SCA 3) were histologically examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VCP was found in two of the seven SCA 1 patients (29%), three of the nineteen SCA 3 patients (16%), and in nine of the eleven MSA patients (82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VCP observed in SCA 1 and SCA 3 was various in the severity and showed no exacerbation on sleep load test in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the eight patients but one SCA 3 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this patient, the findings of fiberoptic laryngoscopy were quite similar to those found in MSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the intrinsic laryngeal muscles including cricothyroid (CT), interarytenoid (IA), and posterior cricoarytenoid (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) muscles showed neurogenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in one autopsied SCA 1 and four SCA 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our conclusion is that VCP in SCA 1 and SCA 3 contrasts with that in MSA in its occurrence, response to the sleep load test, and the distribution of the neurogenic abnormalities among the intrinsic laryngeal muscles </plain></SENT>
