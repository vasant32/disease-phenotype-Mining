<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms underlying the selective neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, human SK-N-SH <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells stably transfected with full-length <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> with 78 CAG repeats were assayed for the dynamic expression of Hsp27, known as a suppressor of poly-Q mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, in the presence of mutant ataxin-3 in different passages of cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A dramatic decrease of Hsp27 expression was observed in the earlier passage of cultured SK-N-SH-MJD78 cells, however, the later passage of cells showed a significant increase of Hsp27 to almost the same level of the parental cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> transgenic mice and post-mortem human brain tissues showed increased expression of Hsp27 compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control brain, suggesting an up-regulation of Hsp27 in the end stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, mutant cells of earlier passages were more susceptible to serum deprivation than mutant cells of later passages, indicating weak tolerance toward stress in cells with reduced Hsp27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While heat shock was used to assess the stress response, cells expressing mutant ataxin-3 displayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> response upon heat shock stimuli when compared to the parental cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we proposed that during the early disease stage, the reduction of Hsp27 synthesis mitigated the ability of neuron cells to cope with cytotoxicity induced by mutant ataxin-3, triggering the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> process during the disease progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the late stage of disease, after prolonged stressful conditions of polyglutamine cytotoxicity, the increased level of Hsp27 may reflect a dynamic process of the survived cells to unfold and remove mutant ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, this increased Hsp27 still cannot reverse the global dysfunction of cellular proteins due to accumulation of cytotoxic effects </plain></SENT>
