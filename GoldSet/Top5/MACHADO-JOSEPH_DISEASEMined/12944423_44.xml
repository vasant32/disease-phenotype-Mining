<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo> (SCAs) are a class of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, which are caused by the pathological expansion of unstable CAG triplet repeats found in a number of apparently unrelated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proteins encoded by the SCA genes typically translate this expanded (CAG)n repeat into an expanded poly(Q) stretch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several pathological features are common to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SCAs, irrespective of the gene harbouring the expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specific contributions of the mutated genes are currently hard to assess, as the physiological role of most of the so-called ataxins is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By combining the results of profile-based sequence analysis with genome-wide functional data available for model organisms, we have derived detailed predictions of the physiological function of two SCA gene products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3, the protein mutated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado Joseph Disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>), belongs to a novel group of cysteine-proteases and is predicted to be active against ubiquitin chains or related substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The catalytic site of this enzyme class is similar to that found in UBP and UCH type ubiquitin proteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For ataxin-7, the gene product of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e> gene, we have identified an orthology relationship to the yeast open reading frame Ygl066c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recently published evidence from genome-wide studies suggests that Ygl066c is a component of the SAGA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetyltransferase complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By analogy, a similar role for the mammalian ataxin-7 can be expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The functional predictions reported here are sufficiently precise to allow a direct experimental verification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both findings have implications for the general pathogenesis of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo> by providing a direct connection of these diseases with ubiquitin metabolism and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation </plain></SENT>
