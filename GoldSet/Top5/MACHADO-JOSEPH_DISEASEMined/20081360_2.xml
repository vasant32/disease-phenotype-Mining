<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> attenuates the phenotype in a mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington disease</z:e> when administered pre-symptomatically and have recently extended this to demonstrate the effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> in a transgenic mouse model of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3, a polyglutamine disorder caused by mutations in the ataxin-3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">Rapamycin</z:chebi>, administered from the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease signs, improves motor coordination and results in a decrease in the levels of soluble mutant ataxin-3 and protein aggregates in the brain </plain></SENT>
