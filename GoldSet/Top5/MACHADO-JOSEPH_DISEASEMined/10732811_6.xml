<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease-causing mutation has recently been identified as an unstable and expanded (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat in a novel gene of unknown function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Caucasians, repeat expansions in the MJD1 gene have also been found in patients with the clinically distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> type 3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to gain insight into the biology of the MJD1/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> gene we cloned the rat homologue and studied its expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rat and human ataxin-3 genes are highly homologous with an overall sequence identity of approximately 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the C-terminal end of the putative protein differs strongly from the published human sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The (CAG)n block in the rat cDNA consists of just three interrupted units suggesting that a long polyglutamine stretch is not essential for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function of the ataxin-3 protein in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression pattern of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> gene in various rat and human tissues was investigated by Northern blot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mature transcript is approximately 6 kb in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In rat testis, a smaller transcript of 1.3 kb was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transcription of rsca3 was detected in most rat tissues including brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analyzing the expression level of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> gene in several human brain sections revealed no significant higher <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level in regions predominantly affected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
