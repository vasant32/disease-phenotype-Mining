<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify the neural pathways affected neurophysiologically, correlate the findings with the size of CAG expansion and determine the contribution of neurophysiological studies in the differential diagnosis of the two most prevalent genotypes in Spain, SCA2 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We examined 10 SCA2 and 12 SCA3 patients by electromyography, electroneurography motor and sensory, multimodal evoked potentials, transcranial magnetic stimulation, blink reflex and masseter reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the statistical analysis linear regression studies were performed, and the, Spearman correlation coefficient and nonparametric test U of Mann-Whitney calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We detected the presence of a predominantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> in most SCA2 patients and in a minority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients; the central somatosensory pathway showed significant defects in both populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We recorded a high incidence of brain-stem electrophysiological abnormalities in SCA2 patients; in particular, the masseter reflex was abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SCA2 patients, remaining intact in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study of cortico-spinal pathway showed a greater percentage of abnormalities in both populations than in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SCA2 is a model of sensory neuronopathy with central and peripheral axonopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Studies of brain-stem pathways show a higher incidence of abnormalities in SCA2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> patients show major changes in the central somatosensory pathway with relative normality of the electroneurography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The masseter reflex was the most useful test in the differential diagnosis between both genotypes </plain></SENT>
