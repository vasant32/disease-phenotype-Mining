<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism by which S-T exerts its pharmacological actions on the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system was not delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purposes of the present studies are to investigate whether or not S-T is effective in alleviating the neurological symptoms and signs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, and then to clarify the mechanism how S-T exerts its pharmacological actions on the neurological deficits, and finally to test the effectiveness of tetrahydrobiopterin (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="30157">BH4</z:chebi>) as a treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9332">Sulfamethoxazole</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="45924">trimethoprim</z:chebi> double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical results were as follows; mild improvements of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001347'>hyperreflexia</z:hpo> of knee jerks and of rigospasticity of the legs during S-T treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, S-T significantly reduced the times of 8 motor activities on the timed tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The biochemical results showed that basal levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15373">biopterins</z:chebi> and homovanillic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) were reduced to less than half the levels of controls with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After S-T treatment, total and oxidized form of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15373">biopterins</z:chebi> in the CSF increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, S-T may be effective to neurologic deficits through its mechanism of increasing the level of brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15373">biopterins</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study prompted us to investigate whether or not tetrahydrobiopterin (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="30157">BH4</z:chebi>) is useful as a therapeutic strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(2) Tetrahydrobiopterin double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003298'>Choking</z:mp> was mildly improved on the first tetrahydrobiopterin (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="30157">BH4</z:chebi>) treatment day, though not significant (p &lt; 0.10) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001347'>Hyperreflexia</z:hpo> of the knee jerks was mildly improved on the 10th day of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="30157">BH4</z:chebi> treatment, but it was not significant (p &lt; 0.10) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Significant improvements were seen on several timed tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These results, though preliminary, implied that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="30157">BH4</z:chebi> showed mild improvements of neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
