<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the mechanism underlying the meiotic instability of expanded CAG repeats in the gene for DRPLA, we determined the CAG repeat sizes of 427 single sperm from two individuals with DRPLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean variance of the change in the CAG repeat size in sperm from the DRPLA patients (288.0) was larger than any variances of the CAG repeat size in sperm from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>5), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> (69.0) and spinal and bulbar <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscular atrophy</z:hpo> (16.3), which is consistent with the clinical observation that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003743'>genetic anticipation</z:hpo> on the paternal transmission of DRPLA is the most prominent among CAG repeat diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The variance of the change in CAG repeat size was significantly different between the two DRPLA patients (F-test, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the segregation ratio of single sperm with an expanded allele to ones with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele is not statistically different ( P = 0.161) from the expected 1:1 segregation ratio, and thus segregation distortion of expanded alleles in meiosis in male patients with DRPLA was not demonstrated </plain></SENT>
