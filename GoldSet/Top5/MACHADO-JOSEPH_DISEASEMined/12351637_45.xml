<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously identified p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP), an AAA ATPase with two conserved ATPase domains (D1 and D2), as an interacting partner of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>) protein with expanded polyglutamines that causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To reveal its pathophysiological roles in neuronal cells, we focused on its ATPase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We constructed and characterized PC12 cells expressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p97/VCP and p97(K524A), a D2 domain mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression level, localization, and complex formation of both proteins were indistinguishable, but the ATPase activity of p97(K524A) was much lower than that of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>p97(K524A) induced cytoplasmic vacuoles that stained with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker, and accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in the nuclear and membrane but not cytoplasmic fractions was observed, together with the elevation of ER stress markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results show that p97/VCP is essential for degrading membrane-associated ubiquitinated proteins and that profound deficits in its ATPase activity severely affect ER quality control, leading to abnormal ER expansion and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Excessive accumulation of misfolded proteins may inactivate p97/VCP in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e>, eventually leading to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
