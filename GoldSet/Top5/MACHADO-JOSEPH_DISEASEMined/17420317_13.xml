<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of 4 multiplex families with MSA, including clinical genetic aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Clinical and genetic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Four departments of neurology in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients Eight patients in 4 families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic failure</z:e> with age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> ranging from 58 to 72 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two siblings in each family were affected with these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical evaluation was performed according to criteria by Gilman et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Trinucleotide repeat expansion in the responsible genes for the spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (SCA) series and for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (DRPLA) was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Direct sequence analysis of coding regions in the alpha-synuclein gene was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Consanguineous marriage was observed in 1 of 4 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among 8 patients, 1 had definite MSA, 5 had probable MSA, and 2 had possible MSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most frequent phenotype was MSA with predominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo>, observed in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six patients showed pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> with cross sign or slitlike signal change at the posterolateral putaminal margin or both on brain magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Possibilities of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxias</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA1</z:e> (ataxin 1, ATXN1), SCA2 (ATXN2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MJD|SCA3">Machado-Joseph disease</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> (ATXN1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> (ATXN1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA7</z:e> (ATXN7), SCA12 (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory subunit B, beta isoform; PP2R2B), SCA17 (TATA box binding protein, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi>) and DRPLA (atrophin 1; ATN1), were excluded, and no mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Findings in these multiplex families suggest the presence of familial MSA with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive inheritance</z:hpo> and a genetic predisposition to MSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic approaches focusing on familial MSA are expected to provide clues to the pathogenesis of MSA </plain></SENT>
