<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study of brains from four autopsied <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients, we have demonstrated immunohistochemically that expanded polyglutamine stretches largely accumulate as inclusions in neuronal nuclei, and less frequently are distributed in the nucleoplasm in a diffuse pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These nuclear abnormalities involved many neurons covering a wide range of central and peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system regions, including the cerebral cortex, thalamus and autonomic ganglia that have been categorized previously as spared regions by conventional pathological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These lesions, newly recognized by polyglutamine immunohistochemistry, may be responsible for the cerebral cortical dysfunctions or autonomic abnormalities pointed out in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients by the recent clinical and neuroradiological studies </plain></SENT>
