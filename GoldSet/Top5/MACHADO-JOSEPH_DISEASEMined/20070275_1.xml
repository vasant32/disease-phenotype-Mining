<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS OF THE STUDY: We used clinical evaluation and sympathetic skin responses (SSR) to assess autonomic function in a large series of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 50 patients were enrolled in this study and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them had the molecular confirmation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> by DNA genotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, a group of 20 control subjects was included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, autonomic complaints were more frequent in patients than in control subjects, especially those related to the genitourinary and sudomotor systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (36%) presented abnormal SSR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, duration of disease and length of expanded (CAG)(n) were not different between patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>dysautonomia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>dysautonomia</z:hpo> was significantly associated with polyneuropathic or parkinsonian phenotypes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Autonomic symptoms are common, but possibly under recognized in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>; therefore, we believe that autonomic complaints should be sought in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e>, especially in those with parkinsonian or polyneuropathic phenotypes </plain></SENT>
