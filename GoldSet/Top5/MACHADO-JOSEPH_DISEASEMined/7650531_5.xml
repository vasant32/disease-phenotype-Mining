<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We systematically and quantitatively analyzed the myelinated fiber densities in various nerves of three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients and compared the results with the patients' clinical features and the pathological findings for the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results obtained were (1) motor system: The number of intermediate gammamotoneuron fibers was decreased prominently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the type III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> cases, the number of large alpha-motoneuron fibers also were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) Sensory system: it generally was less involved than the motor system at the root level; but the large fibers of the distal portion were vulnerable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) Oculomotor system: the number of large oculomotor fibers was decreased markedly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases, but there was relative preservation of parasympathetic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(4) Autonomic system: the preganglionic sympathetic fibers from the intermediate lateral nucleus generally were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> the vulnerability of the peripheral nerves reflects the degree of loss of their original neuronal cells and varies according to the clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The characteristic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> may be the result of <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp> due to perikaryal neuronal damage in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
