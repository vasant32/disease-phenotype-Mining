<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although previous studies describe the aggregate formation and toxic effect of the expanded polyglutamine tract in vitro and in vivo, differences in the susceptibility of different cultured cell lines has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the plasmid expressing N-terminal truncated ataxin-3 with an expanded polyglutamine stretch, we evaluated the aggregate formation and cytotoxicity in eight cultured cell lines-HeLa, Swiss/3T3, P19, C2C12, COS-1, BHK-21, PC12, and Neuro2a-that demonstrated a diverse range of aggregate formation and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although aggregate frequency did not appear to be correlated with cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, Neuro2a demonstrated a high frequency of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data indicates that susceptibility to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> produced by mutant truncated ataxin-3 differs significantly among different cell lines and provides useful information when using a cultured cell line as an in vitro cellular model of polyglutamine disease </plain></SENT>
