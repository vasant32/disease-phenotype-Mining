<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3 is degraded by the proteasome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the precise mechanism of ataxin-3 degradation remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show direct links between ataxin-3 and the proteasome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p45, an ATPase subunit of the 19S proteasome, interacts with ataxin-3 in vitro and stimulates the degradation of ataxin-3 in an in vitro reconstituted degradation assay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of p45 on ataxin-3 degradation is blocked by MG132, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In N2a or 293 cells, overexpression of p45 strikingly enhances the clearance of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and expanded ataxin-3, but not alpha synuclein or SOD1, implying a functional specificity of p45 in this proteolytic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The N-terminus of ataxin-3, which serves as a recognition site by p45, is necessary for the proteolytic process of ataxin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also show that other three ATPases of the 19S proteasome, MSS1, p48, and p56 have no effect on ataxin-3 degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data provide evidence that p45 plays an important role in regulating ataxin-3 degradation by the proteasome </plain></SENT>
