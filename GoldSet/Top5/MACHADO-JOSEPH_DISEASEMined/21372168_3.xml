<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebellar and brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> are important features in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> has been regarded as a "pure" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent neuropathologic studies have described additional brain stem involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, aimed to investigate the occurrence and impact of regional infratentorial brain volume differences in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with genetically proved SCA (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, n = 17; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e>, n = 17) and age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 51) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, high-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired with a 1.5T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individual brain stem and cerebellar volumes were calculated by using semiautomated volumetry approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with SCA, clinical dysfunction was scored according to the ICARS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis was used to identify the contribution of regional volumes to explain the variance in clinical dysfunction in each SCA genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebellar volumes were lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> compared with controls and with those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to controls, brain stem volume loss was observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> (P &lt; .001) and, to a lesser extent, in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> (P = .027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant linear dependencies were found between ICARS and cerebellum volume (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>: R(2) = 0.29, P = .02; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e>: R(2) = 0.29, P = .03) and between ICARS and brain stem volume (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>: R(2) = 0.49, P = .002; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e>: R(2) = 0.39, P &lt; .01) in both subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both cerebellar and brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> contributed independently to the variance in clinical dysfunction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e>, while in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e>, only brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was of relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our current findings in accordance with recent neuroradiologic and pathoanatomic studies suggest brain stem and cerebellar volume loss as attractive surrogate markers of disease severity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA3</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCA6</z:e> </plain></SENT>
