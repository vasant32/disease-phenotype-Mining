<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> functions of AT3 as well as its function in the context of expansion of the polyglutamine tract is critical for understanding the disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AT3 is a deubiquitylating enzyme with limited information on its cellular functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We find that transfecting cells with AT3 increases cellular levels of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) substrates, CD3delta and TCRalpha, but does not alter levels of several non-ERAD substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AT3 increases the level of CD3delta by decreasing its degradation; pathogenic AT3 decreases degradation to a greater extent than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> AT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Knock-down of endogenous AT3 decreases levels of CD3delta, suggesting that a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function of AT3 is to regulate levels of ERAD substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AT3 binds VCP/p97, a key protein responsible for extracting ERAD substrates from the ER; binding is modulated by the size of the polyglutamine tract, and mutating a sequence adjacent to the polyglutamine tract inhibits the AT3-VCP interaction and AT3-dependent accumulation of CD3delta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AT3 and Ufd1 bind VCP in a mutually exclusive manner; AT3 decreases the interaction of VCP with Ufd1 as well as with ubiquitylated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a reconstituted system, AT3 inhibits retrotranslocation of an ERAD substrate from the ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function of AT3 is to regulate flow through the ERAD pathway by modulating VCP-dependent extraction of proteins from the ER </plain></SENT>
