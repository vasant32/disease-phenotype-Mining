<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is caused by an unstable expansion of the CAG repeat in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This gene is mapped to chromosome 14q32.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine its genomic structure, we constructed a contig composed of six cosmid clones and eight <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome (BAC) clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It spans approximately 300kb and includes <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also determined the complete sequence (175,330bp) of B445M7, a human BAC clone that contains <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene was found to span 48,240bp and to contain 11 exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, and in at least four different sizes; namely, 1.4, 1.8, 4.5, and 7.5kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These different <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species probably result from differential splicing and polyadenylation, as shown by sequences of the 21 independent cDNA clones isolated after the screening of four human cDNA libraries prepared from whole brain, caudate, retina, and testis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sequences of these latter clones relative to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> gene in B445M7 indicate that there are three alternative splicing sites and eight polyadenylation signals in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MJD</z:e> that are used to generate the differently sized transcripts </plain></SENT>
