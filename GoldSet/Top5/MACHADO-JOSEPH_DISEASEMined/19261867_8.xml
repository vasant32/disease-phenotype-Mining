<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23995">ENU</z:chebi>-induced neurological mutant ataxia3 was mapped to distal mouse chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the positional candidate gene Scn8a encoding the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel Na(v)1.6 identified a T&gt;C transition in exon 1 resulting in the amino acid substitution p.S21P near the N terminus of the channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cytoplasmic N-terminal region is evolutionarily conserved but its function has not been well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ataxia3 homozygotes exhibit a severe disorder that includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo>, and juvenile <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike Scn8a null mice, they retain partial hindlimb function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutant transcript is stable but protein abundance is reduced and the mutant channel is not detected in its usual site of concentration at nodes of Ranvier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In whole-cell patch-clamp studies of transfected ND7/23 cells that were maintained at 37 degrees C, the mutant channel did not produce <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current, and function was not restored by coexpression of beta1 and beta2 subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when transfected cells were maintained at 30 degrees C, the mutant channel generated voltage-dependent inward <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> currents with an average peak current density comparable with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, demonstrating recovery of channel activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of primary cerebellar granule cells from ataxia3 mice demonstrated that the mutant protein is retained in the cis-Golgi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This trafficking defect can account for the low level of Na(v)1.6-S21P at nodes of Ranvier in vivo and at the surface of transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data demonstrate that the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel is required for anterograde transport from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
