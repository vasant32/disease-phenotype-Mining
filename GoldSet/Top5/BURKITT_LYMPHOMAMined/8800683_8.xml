<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Direct labeling of apoptotic cells (DLAC) was performed by incorporation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> (F-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>) in DNA strand breaks by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nick-end-labeling using F-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> obviates the need for second-step revelation reagents without reducing the specificity of detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells were analyzed by microscopy or flow cytometry for objective quantification of apoptotic cells in controlled dilution samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that DLAC is compatible with surface labeling by monoclonal antibodies, allowing dual-color analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data presented here illustrate the simplicity and potential of this method, which allows the preservation of fragile cells and the possibility of combining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> detection with immunostaining </plain></SENT>
