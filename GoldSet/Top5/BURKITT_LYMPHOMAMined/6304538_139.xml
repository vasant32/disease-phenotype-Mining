<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human cellular homologue, c-myc, located on human chromosome 8, region q24 leads to qter (refs 1, 2), is translocated into the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on human chromosome 14 (ref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>3) in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, suggesting that c-myc has a primary role in transformation of some human haematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, c-myc is amplified in the human promyelocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> cell line, HL60 (refs 6, 7) which also contains high levels of c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, Colby et al. reported the nucleotide sequence of the human c-myc DNA isolated from a genomic recombinant DNA library derived from human fetal liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This 4,053-base pair (bp) sequence includes two exons and one intron of the myc gene, and the authors have suggested the existence of a human c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of 2,291 nucleotides that has a coding capacity for a protein of molecular weight (Mr) 48,812 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have approached the problem of accurately defining the characteristics of the human c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and c-myc protein by determining the sequence of the c-myc cDNA isolated from a cDNA library prepared from <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of a clone of the K562 human leukaemic cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>K562 cells are known to contain c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> which is similar in size to the c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of other human cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We report here the sequence of 2,121 nucleotides of a human c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and demonstrate that its 5' noncoding sequence does not correspond to the sequence of the reported genomic human sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, our data confirm that the intact human c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> can encode a 48,812-Mr protein with a sequence identical to that reported by Colby et al </plain></SENT>
