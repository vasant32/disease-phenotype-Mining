<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In developing countries, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> has a strong association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> during childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In South America, the data have shown an EBV association intermediate between that reported in the United States (30%) and that in equatorial Africa (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early age at <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and lower socioeconomic status have been related to increased EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Brazil, there are not enough data on childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate the clinicopathologic features and EBV association of 44 children with NHL from the state of Rio de Janeiro, situated in the southeast of Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBV was detected using <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in situ hybridization in 36 biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA from fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples and from paraffin-embedded tissues of patients were analyzed by PCR, in which the first reaction included primers for an EBNA-2 common region while the nested reaction amplified the region discriminating between EBV types 1 and 2 in separate reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBV was detected in 21 of 29 BLs (72%), and type 1 virus infected the majority of EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> (18/21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for younger age in children with EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> compared to EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (median age 4 compared to 6 years, respectively; p = 0.056) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study confirmed that in the southeast of Brazil <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> had an intermediate association with EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A higher rate of EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> was described in the northeast of Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These differences are probably related to regional socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study suggests that early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with EBV in the background of a low socioeconomic condition associated with other environmental factors could contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in Brazil </plain></SENT>
