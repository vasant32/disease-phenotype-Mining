<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies identified three Burkitts <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, Ramos, MUTU-I and Daudi, that were growth inhibited by anti-IgM antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, only Ramos and MUTU-I were sensitive to monoclonal antibodies (mAb) recognizing the Fc region of surface IgM (anti-Fc mu) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experiments using anti-Fc mu mAb (single or non-crossblocking pairs), polyclonal anti-mu Ab, and hyper-crosslinking with a secondary layer of Ab, showed that growth inhibition of B-cell lines was highly dependent on the extent of IgM crosslinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by using Fab', F(ab')2 and F(ab')3 derivatives from anti-Fc mu mAb, where increasing valency caused corresponding increases in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, presumably as a result of more efficient BCR-crosslinking on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ability of a single mAb to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> was highly dependent on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> specificity, with mAb specific for the Fc region (C <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46620">mu2</z:chebi>-C mu4 domains) being much more effective than those recognizing the Fab region (anti-L chain, anti-Id and anti-Fd mu, or C mu1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only when hyper-crosslinked with polyclonal anti-mouse IgG did the latter result in appreciable growth inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binding studies showed that these differences in function were not related to differences in the affinity, but probably related to intrinsic crosslinking capacity of mAb </plain></SENT>
