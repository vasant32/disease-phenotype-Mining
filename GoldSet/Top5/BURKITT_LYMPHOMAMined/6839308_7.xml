<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 14q+ marker has been reported so far in 13 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1136084" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">plasma cell dyscrasia</z:e>, but only in 3 of them was the origin of the extra material on the 14q+ identified by banding analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present case is the first one shown to involve a 14q+ marker derived from a Burkitt-type 8;14 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest is the association of the 8;14 translocation with lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> of the B-cell lineage </plain></SENT>
