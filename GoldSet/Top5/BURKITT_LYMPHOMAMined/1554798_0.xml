<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the configuration of the immunoglobulin genes in the leukemic blast cell DNA of 20 adults with precursor B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), treated according to the BMFT protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of 20 (80%) patients expressed HLA-DR antigens and lacked detectable T-cell antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 20 patients (55%) were positive for the CD10 antigen and therefore classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients were classified by immunological phenotyping as null-ALL (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients (15%) expressed both immature B-cell markers CD19, CD22, or CD24 and myelomonocytic markers CDw65 or CD15, suggesting precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> with cross-lineage expression of myeloid markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 18 of the 20 patients (90%), rearrangements and/or deletions of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) gene locus were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In none of the patients was a light-chain gene rearrangement observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients (10%) had a rearrangement of one allele for the J beta 1 gene region of the TCR-beta gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four patients (20%) more than two hybridizing bands for the IgH genes were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of these four patients with multiple hybridizing bands for the IgH genes had a t (4;11) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of five patients with the t (4;11) translocation co-expressed both B-cell antigens and the myeloid antigens CD15 or CDw65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the immunophenotype of the ALL and the arrangement pattern of their IgH genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier plot analysis revealed no significant difference between adult precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> patients with monoclonal or oligoclonal IgH gene rearrangements and their disease-free survival rates </plain></SENT>
