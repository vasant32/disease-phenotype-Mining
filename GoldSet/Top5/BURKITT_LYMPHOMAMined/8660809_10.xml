<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Association of interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) has been demonstrated as the proximal event of IL-4 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of this enzyme in the IL-4 signaling pathway in a human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cell line, DND39, that expresses germline C epsilon transcripts in response to IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of DND39 cells with IL-4 resulted in an accumulation of PI-3-monophosphate as well as a decrease of PI-4,5-bisphosphate, which were abrogated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi>, a potent inhibitor of PI3-kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activation of PI3-kinase was further confirmed by the finding that IL-4 caused an increase in PI3-kinase activity coimmunoprecipitated with anti-IL-4R and with anti-JAK3 kinase antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a possible downstream event of PI3-kinase activation, the translocation of a zeta isoform of protein kinase C (PKC) from the cytosol to the membrane fraction was observed after IL-4 stimulation, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> also suppressed this translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, IL-4-induced expression of germline C epsilon transcription was inhibited not only by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi>, but also by a PKC inhibitor, K252a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the signaling pathway involving PI3-kinase and PKC zeta plays an important role in induction of germline C epsilon transcription in DND39 cells by IL-4 </plain></SENT>
