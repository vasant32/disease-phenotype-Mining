<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of heat-shock on the expression of c-myc genes in different chromosomal contexts was investigated in a panel of human B-lymphoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines with c-myc translocation breakpoints upstream of the first exon, within the exon itself, or in the first intron showed downregulation of c-myc levels as did a cell line without any translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of cell lines with translocation breakpoints within the c-myc gene have previously been reported to have prolonged half-lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After heat shock, the levels of these <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species were reduced with similar kinetics as the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An exception was an <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> species where the only c-myc sequences are derived from exon 1, showing that sequences from this part of the c-myc gene are not sufficient to mediate the rapid downregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nuclear run-on analysis did not show reduced transcription of c-myc after heat shock and a comparison of cytoplasmic and total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> did not indicate accumulation of longer, unspliced c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest a posttranscriptional, cytoplasmic downregulation targeting exons 2 and/or 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines transfected with a hsp70 promoter-linked c-myc gene were deficient in their ability to reinitiate proliferation after heat shock, providing a physiological rationale for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> downregulation of c-myc after this type of physical stress </plain></SENT>
