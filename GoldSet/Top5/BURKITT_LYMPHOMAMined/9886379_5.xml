<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We herein analyzed the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity by CR2 activated on B lymphocyte cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that CR2 activation triggered in vivo PI 3-kinase activity and interaction of PI 3-kinase p85 subunit with a tyrosine-phosphorylated p95 component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The specificity of PI 3-kinase activity was controlled using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> and LY294002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CR2 activation did not trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase p85 subunit, but induced direct interaction of tyrosine phosphorylated p95 with the Src homology 2 domain of p85 subunit, as shown using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-S-transferase fusion proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite identical molecular masses, immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that tyrosine-phosphorylated p95 that interacted in vivo and in vitro with p85 was neither CD19, the 95-kDa proto-oncogene vav, nor Gab1 (a 95-kDa adaptor molecule) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, p95 tyrosine phosphoprotein also expressed in K562A cells (CR2+ CD19- cells) interacted with Src homology 2 domain of PI 3-kinase p85 subunit after CR2 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activated CR2 did not interact directly with p85 subunit or tyrosine-phosphorylated p95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests the presence of an intermediate molecule between activated CR2 and tyrosine-phosphorylated p95, which may be 3BP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, in contrast to CD19 activation, CR2 activation did not trigger interaction of CD19 or Vav with PI 3-kinase p85 subunit or coprecipitation of PI 3-kinase activity with CD19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, these data clearly demonstrated that CR2 activation triggered in vivo PI 3-kinase activation through a pathway distinct from that triggered through CD19 activation </plain></SENT>
