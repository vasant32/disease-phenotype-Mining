<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The original inoculum was derived from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> of a child with a primary abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which clinically and histologically resembled Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to the absence of the EBV genome and EBV receptors, this line possesses a number of other properties which distinguish it from previously described lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has different growth characteristics and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>; does not form EAC or E rosettes (representative of B and T) cell surface markers, respectively); possesses IgM-kappa immunoglobulins on the cell surface (B lymphocyte), has an unusually high cap-forming ability and low agglutinability with fluorescent concanavalin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One homologue of the No.14 chromosome pair possesses extra chromatin material as revealed on chromosome banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This abnormal chromosome marker is similar to that described in biopsies and cultured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from patients with African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
