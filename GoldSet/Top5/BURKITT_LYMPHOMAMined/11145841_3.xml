<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Relapse of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) comprises a leading challenge of investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Characterization of leukaemic cells regarding their potency to express growth factors and surface molecules can provide insight into their aberrant biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we analyzed bone marrow blasts from 10 children with relapsed B cell precursor ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gene and protein expression of essential haematopoietic growth factors (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-10, IL-15, IFN-gamma, G-CSFR), their corresponding receptors as well as the expression pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (ICAM-1, CD58) and costimulatory proteins (CD40, CD40L, B7.1, B7.2, CD28, MHC-I and II) was analyzed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Constitutive gene expression was found for IL-7, IL-10, IL-15 and IFN-gamma and their corresponding receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow-cytometric analysis showed that IL-10R, IL-7Ralpha, IL-4Ralpha and the gamma(c)chain are constitutively expressed, and that some cells bear the G-CSFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-10 and IL-15 protein-producing leukaemic cells were easily detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic cells mainly lack B7.1, and ICAM-1 is mostly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, high CD40, and, surprisingly, CD40L expression could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies show that ALL cells are likely to be sensitive to many growth factors and some factors are produced by the neoplastic cell itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The secretion of IL-10 by leukaemic cells, and the absence or downregulation of conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and costimulatory molecules might represent an effective mechanism of escape of immune surveillance in relapsed ALL </plain></SENT>
