<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>INTERMEDIATE GRADE OR HIGH GRADE <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024299" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">LYMPHOMA</z:e>: The recommended treatment of early-stage aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is primarily a combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The interest of adjuvant radiotherapy remains unclear and has to be established through large prospective trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If radiation therapy has to be delivered, the historical results of exclusive radiation therapy showed that involved-fields and a dose of 35-40 Gy (daily fraction of 1.8 Gy, 5 days a week) are the optimal schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interest of radiotherapy in the treatment of advanced-stage aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is yet to be proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further studies had to stratify localized stages according to the factors of the International Prognostic Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LOW-GRADE <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024299" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">LYMPHOMA</z:e>: For early-stage low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, radiotherapy remains the standard treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the appropriate technique to use is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Involved-field irradiation at a dose of 35 Gy seems to be the optimal schedule, providing a 10-year disease-free survival rate of 50% and no major toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is no standard indication of radiotherapy in the treatment advanced-stage low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
