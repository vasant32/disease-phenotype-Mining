<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Post-transplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (PTLD) is a known complication of both solid organ transplantation and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) but is rarely seen following autologous BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 45 year-old female who developed Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> eight years after a renal allograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This PTLD was found to have lambda light chain restriction, contained del(8)(q24) and add(14)(q32), and was negative for EBV on immunohistochemical and DNA-based PCR analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) PCR studies revealed a prominent clonal rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She responded to intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and proceeded to high-dose chemoradiotherapy and mafosfamide-purged autologous BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine days post-BMT she presented with cough and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and developed hepatic dysfunction; abnormal lymphoplasmacytoid cells were noted in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Investigations revealed kappa light chain restriction, an oligoclonal IgH rearrangement, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and PCR studies for EBV were positive, consistent with a clinically and biologically distinct PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She initially improved following discontinuation of immunosuppression, but then deteriorated abruptly and died 58 days post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the two separate episodes of PTLD in this patient, one of which was atypical, arose as a result of both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and the impairment of cell-mediated immunity associated with autologous BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sequence of events in this patient should contribute to a better understanding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo>, EBV-negative PTLD </plain></SENT>
