<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A comparison was made of the immunofluorescence tests for detection of cell membrane and Epstein-Barr virus antigens in cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> biopsies or continuous cultures derived therefrom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the whole, cell membrane fluorescence in established lines appeared to depend not only upon the presence of EBV but to a considerable degree also upon the extent of the persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no constant relationship, however, between the results of the two tests and exceptions to the rule were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that different antigens are involved in the two tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsy cells in general and young cultures may reveal strong MIF activity but few, if any, EBV-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reverse, the presence of relatively large numbers of EBV antigen-containing cells in the absence of significant MIF reactions, was also noted on occasion in a few established cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The possible interpretations of these findings have been discussed </plain></SENT>
