<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy chain hypervariable region (IgH V) genes of HRS cells revealed multiple nucleotide substitutions, indicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo>, and suggested that HRS cells originate from germinal center B cells or their progeny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that CD99-antisense transfected B cell lines led to the generation of cells with a HRS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because it is considered that HRS cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> carry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> of the IgH genes, we assume that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> may take place in the IgH genes of HRS-like cells which do not express CD99 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we report that CD99 downregulated BJAB cell line has several mutations in IgH V genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of mutation was 5.2 x 10(-4) mut.bp(-1) out of total sequenced cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, control vector transfected BJAB cell line or CD99 downregulated IM9 cell line did not show any mutations on single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We expect that the analysis of the mutation pattern of the CD99-deficient BJAB cell line might be the basis for the understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanism that regulate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> and B cell selection </plain></SENT>
