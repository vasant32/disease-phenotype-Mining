<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> characteristics that improve the understanding of biology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, analysis of oligonucleotide microarrays were used to define specific gene expression profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsy samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cases were compared to reactive lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among genes differentially expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> were genes that are involved in the regulation of proliferation, cell signalling, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and homing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, some genes with previously unknown function, such as C11orf32, C2orf10, TBC1D9 and ABCA6 were found to be differentially expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> compared to reactive lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of special interest was the high expression of the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cases analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were further confirmed at the cellular and protein level by immunocytochemical staining and immunoblotting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was a reduced expression of a regulator of G protein signalling, RGS13 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e>, with a complete absence in the majority of cases while present in control lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results were further confirmed by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the RGS13 gene revealed changes suggesting polymorphisms, indicating that downregulation of the expression of RGS13 is not related to mutations, but may serve as a new specific marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, comparison between individual cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, revealed that the CCND1 gene appears to be differently expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cases with high vs low proliferative activity </plain></SENT>
