<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results have disclosed an early increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi>-bisphosphate (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18348">PIP2</z:chebi>) hydrolysis at nuclear level upon interferon (IFN) treatment paralleled by the evidence of an increase of PIC beta 1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PIC beta 1 expression has been detected in the nuclear compartment also in a clone of Daudi cells selected for the resistance to the antiproliferative action of interferon alpha but no modulation of the enzyme has been detected upon interferon treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since no changes in terms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18348">PIP2</z:chebi> hydrolysis have been found at nuclear level in this selected line, we suggest that the antiproliferative action of interferon on Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells is mediated by a possible recruitment of nuclear PIC beta 1 expression </plain></SENT>
