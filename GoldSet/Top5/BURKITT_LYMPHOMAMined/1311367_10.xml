<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This provides an experimental animal model for assessing the efficacy of candidate EBV vaccines which are intended to reduce the incidence of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous work has shown that experimental vaccines based on the major virus envelope <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> gp340 prepared from the membranes of EBV-infected cells are effective in protecting cottontop tamarins against EBV-induced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> purified gp340 preparations induce protective immunity against EBV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the tamarin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this work, cottontop tamarins were immunized with recombinant gp340, produced using a bovine papillomavirus (BPV) expression vector, and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32835">threonyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25433">muramyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46761">dipeptide</z:chebi> adjuvant formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the recombinant-derived gp340 lacked the membrane anchor sequence of authentic gp340 and was expressed in mouse cells, it was immunogenic and induced virus-neutralizing antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Healthy vaccinated tamarins were protected against EBV-induced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The demonstration that a recombinant gp340 product is able to elicit protective immunity in the cottontop tamarin is a significant step in the development of an EBV vaccine because previously it had not been clear whether a recombinant product would have the exact tertiary structure, including the necessary carbohydrate components, to induce protective immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A recombinant gp340 vaccine offers various advantages over production of the authentic molecule by laborious biochemical separation, including lower cost and the absence of potentially oncogenic EBV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, recombinant gp340 produced using the BPV expression vector is suitable for development as a candidate EBV vaccine for a human Phase I trial and beyond </plain></SENT>
