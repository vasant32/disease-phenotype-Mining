<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two kinds of these categories are mentioned: the prototype and the family resemblance categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such categories obviously do exist in medical domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Search on the Net was performed for free text definition for some commonly used medical categories, like '<z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>', 'Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>' and 'disease' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the found often contradicting definitions do not follow the Aristotelian rules of definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many definitions describe statistical properties of the category that are often useless in individual cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A simple way is suggested that makes possible to represent such categories in biomedical ontologies and treat them separate from better formed categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This makes possible to revise these categories at any later stage of ontology development </plain></SENT>
