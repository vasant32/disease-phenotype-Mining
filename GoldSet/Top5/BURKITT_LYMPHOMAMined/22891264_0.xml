<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lack of sequence specificity in origin recognition complex (ORC) DNA binding complicates genome-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) persists as chromatinized minichromosomes that are replicated by the host replication machinery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used EBV to investigate the link between zones of pre-replication complex (pre-RC) assembly, replication initiation, and micrococcal nuclease (MNase) sensitivity at different cell cycle stages in a genome-wide fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dyad symmetry element (DS) of EBV's latent origin, a well-established and very efficient pre-RC assembly region, served as an internal control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified 64 pre-RC zones that correlate spatially with 57 short nascent strand (SNS) zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MNase experiments revealed that pre-RC and SNS zones were linked to regions of increased MNase sensitivity, which is a marker of origin strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, although spatially correlated, pre-RC and SNS zones were characterized by different features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that pre-RCs are formed at flexible but distinct sites, from which only a few are activated per single genome and cell cycle </plain></SENT>
