<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had failed previous chemotherapy regimens, and six patients had relapsed after bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>B43-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">Genistein</z:chebi> was administered as a 1-hour i.v. infusion at 0.1-0.32 mg/kg/day dose levels for 10 consecutive days or 3 consecutive days weekly for a total of nine doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B43-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">Genistein</z:chebi> was well tolerated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with no life-threatening side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were six episodes of grade 2-3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, two of which were clearly drug related, one episode each of grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo>, grade 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo>, and grade 2 vascular leak syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was one durable complete remission and two transient responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic analyses in 12 patients revealed a plasma half-life of 20 +/- 5 h, mean residence time of 24 +/- 5 h, and a systemic clearance rate of 20 +/- 3 ml/h/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moderate levels of human antimouse antibody (HAMA) ranging from 20-87 ng/ml were detected in the day 28 blood samples from three of nine cases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment of these three HAMA-positive patients with a second course of B43-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">Genistein</z:chebi> did not yield measurable immunoconjugate levels in the plasma, indicating that the administered B43-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">Genistein</z:chebi> molecules were rapidly cleared from circulation due to the HAMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of its acceptable toxicity profile and its ability to elicit objective responses at nontoxic dose levels, B43-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">Genistein</z:chebi> may provide the basis for an effective treatment strategy for B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> patients who have failed standard therapy </plain></SENT>
