<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that in several vertebrate cells, they exhibit a subnuclear localisation associated with the nucleolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used monoclonal antibodies to study the distribution of three homeoproteins, namely HOXB7, HOXC6 and HOXD4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivity to antibodies against HOXC6 protein in Xenopus laevis embryonic tissues is restricted to one or two spots within the nucleus; this distribution partially overlaps that of fibrillarin, a protein of the fibrillar zone of the nucleoli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of the distribution of HOXB7 protein in 3T3 cells, and of HOXD4 protein in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> and Raji <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and activated lymphocytes, results invariably in a nucleolar localisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Purified nucleoli from stimulated T lymphocytes, and Raji cells contain an activity capable of binding, in a gel retardation assay, to an oligonucleotide specifically recognised by the HOXD4 homeoprotein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This activity is specifically removed by anti-HOXD4 antibodies and is found associated in southwestern blots with a single band with an apparent M(r) of 30,000, corresponding to that of recombinant HOXD4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The functional significance of the nucleolar localisation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46904">Hox</z:chebi> proteins remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
