<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The culture contained HLA-A1, A11 and B55 restricted, LCL selective cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the T cell culture stimulated four times, the lysis of A11 and B55 carrying targets suggested that the subsets of the two latter CTL types had similar size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After further stimulations the B55 restricted CTLs were enriched in the culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Earlier results suggested that in HLA-A11 positive individuals the A11-restricted LCL-selective CTL subset dominates </plain></SENT>
