<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> could be observed by 24 h after TGF-beta exposure and occurred before the development of a significant blockage of cell cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was also accompanied by a strong induction of caspase-3 subfamily activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incubation of cells with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.FMK at 20 microM, but not at 10 microM, prevented TGF-beta-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> from occurring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By comparison, caspase-3 subfamily activity was 87% inhibited at 10 microM Z-VAD.FMK and completely inhibited at 20 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of TGF-beta's well-established role of regulating gene transcription, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for proteins associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (Fas- and Fas-associated proteins, Bcl-2 family members, IAP proteins, and I kappa B) were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 24 h of TGF-beta treatment, the most significant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> changes occurred with Bcl-XL (two-fold decrease) and Bik (twofold increase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta treatment also resulted after 48 h in a fivefold decrease in Bcl-XL protein levels, based on immunoblotting analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, TGF-beta-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> involves the activation of caspases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, TGF-beta transcriptionally regulates Bcl-2 family members, Bcl-XL and Bik, to further influence the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> process </plain></SENT>
