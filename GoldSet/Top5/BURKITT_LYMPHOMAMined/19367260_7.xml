<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> developing in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients continues to steadily increase worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current chemotherapy and immunotherapy approaches have several limitations, such as severe side toxicity and selection of resistant cell variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autonomous parvoviruses (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>), in particular the rat parvovirus H-1PV, have emerged as promising anticancer agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although it is apathogenic in humans, H-1PV has been shown to infect and suppress various rat and human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate the capacity of H-1PV for efficiently killing, through <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, cell cultures originating from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), while sparing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic effect was generally accompanied by a productive H-1PV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, parvovirus-based monotherapy efficiently suppressed established <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> at an advanced stage in a severe combined immunodeficient (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mouse model of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data show for the first time that an oncolytic parvovirus deserves further consideration as a potential tool for the treatment of some non-Hodgkin B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including those resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction by rituximab </plain></SENT>
