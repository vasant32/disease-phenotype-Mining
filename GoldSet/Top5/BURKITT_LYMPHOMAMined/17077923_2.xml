<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Treatment for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at Red Cross Children's Hospital has evolved from the use of aggressive surgery and less intensive chemotherapy to a conservative surgical approach with more intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was a retrospective folder review of patients diagnosed with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at RCCH between 1984 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-two children were treated for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at RCCH between 1984 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 10 patients with group A or fully resected disease, 52 with group B or extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localised disease</z:e>, and 30 with dissemination to the bone marrow and/or central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system or group C disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protocol 1 (less intensive chemotherapy based on the COMP regimen) was used from 1984, with protocol 2 (more intensive chemotherapy based on the LMB regimen) introduced in 1988 for group C disease, 1991 for group B disease and 1996 for group A disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall 5-year survival increased from 20% with protocol 1 to 66% with protocol 2 for group C disease, and from 76.5% with protocol 1 to 88.2% with protocol 2 for group B disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were more admissions for neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> in patients on protocol 2 and more episodes of mucositis, and these patients required more red cell and platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a more conservative surgical approach, biopsy largely replaced attempts to partially resect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> at primary surgery, and there was a consequent decline in surgical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensive chemotherapy with protocol 2 has resulted in improved survival for group C and group B patients, but with more morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Protocol 1, which is less intensive with less morbidity, remains a viable strategy for group A and group B disease in resource-poor settings </plain></SENT>
