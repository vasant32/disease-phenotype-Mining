<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our experiments were carried out to check several plausible mechanisms proposed to explain this selective inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By examining the c-myc transcripts in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> and using differential S1 mapping, which distinguishes the c-myc transcripts of the translocated from the untranslocated allele, we found that the selective inactivation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc gene locus is not by a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism, by autorepression from the constitutive expression of c-myc protein derived from the translocated locus, nor by suppression due to the previously proposed labile protein repressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results are accommodated most easily by an inactivation mechanism that stably modifies the structure of the untranslocated c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
