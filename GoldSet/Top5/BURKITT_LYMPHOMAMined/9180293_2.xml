<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to confirm this hypothesis, we attempted to transfer human B-CLL with AIHA to immunodeficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 11 B-CLL patients suffering from AIHA were transplanted into the peritoneal cavity of lethally irradiated Balb/c mice reconstituted with <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chimeric mice generated from PBMC of these patients (in stage III-IV of the disease) exhibited an engraftment profile with dominance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and minuscule levels of T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five percent of the chimeric mice generated from 10 out of the 11 B-CLL patients with Coombs'-positive AIHA, produced human Ig with anti-human red cell specificity as detected by indirect anti-globulin test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, anti-red cell auto-antibodies were produced in 36% of chimeric mice generated from PBMC of Coombs'-negative B-CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, control experiments in which splenic cells from idiopathic AIHA or PBMC from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors were transplanted, failed to produce anti-RBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This in vivo model further supports the relationship between the B cell expansion and the autoimmune hemolytic process </plain></SENT>
