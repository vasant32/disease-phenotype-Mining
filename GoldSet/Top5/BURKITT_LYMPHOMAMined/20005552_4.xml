<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cloning and sequencing revealed the presence of a BKV quasispecies which included non-functional variants when assayed in a recombinant virus assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that the rr-NCCR of BKV variants RH-3 and RH-12, both bearing a NCCR deletion including the 5' end of the agnoprotein coding sequence, mediated early and late <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> reporter gene expression in kidney cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in a recombinant virus they failed to produce infectious progeny despite large T-antigen and VP1 expression and the formation of nuclear virus-like particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infectious progeny was generated when the agnogene was reconstructed in cis or agnoprotein provided in trans from a co-existing BKV rr-NCCR variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that complementation can rescue non-functional BKV variants in vitro and possibly in vivo </plain></SENT>
