<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cloning frequency was increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9 sublines investigated, between 1.1 and 4.9 times compared to the original "parental" lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tumorigenicity was increased in one out of 2 BJAB-derived, EBV-positive lines and in 3 of 6 Ramos-derived lines, while it was decreased in 3 others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A strong positive correlation between the number of genomes/cell and the amount of EBNA/cell was detected, and in 7 of 9 converted lines the cloning frequency also correlated to the number of EBV genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, no relation was established between the number of EBV-genomes/cell, the amount of EBNA/cell and tumorigenicity </plain></SENT>
