<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that the different histologic types are genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, evolving through different pathogenetic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recurrent cytogenetic aberrations have been found in MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, whereas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, limited cytogenetic data are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and a Burkitt-like gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> case, cytogenetically studied by G-banding and M-FISH technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first case, gains of chromosome 3, 7, 13, and 18 were found </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, cytogenetic data for gastric Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have not been reported, and M-FISH has not previously been used in the study of gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
