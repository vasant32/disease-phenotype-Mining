<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similar cases have been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> in patients with breast prostheses has been speculated, no studies have been conducted so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> risk is associated with breast prostheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A search for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the breast diagnosed in The Netherlands between 1990 and 2006 was performed through the population-based nationwide pathology database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we performed an individually matched case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the relative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> associated with breast prostheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SETTING AND PATIENTS: Eleven patients with breast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> were identified in the registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For each case patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> in the breast, we selected 1 to 5 controls with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the breast, matched on age and year of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and controls (n = 35), pathological and clinical information was obtained with special emphasis on the presence of a breast prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Association between breast implants and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> of the breast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> of the breast were diagnosed between 1994 and 2006 at a median age of 40 years (range, 24-68 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 5 of these patients, bilateral <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> breast prostheses had been placed 1 to 23 years before diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> received prostheses for cosmetic reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> classes of 35 eligible control patients were 12 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including 1 T-cell rich B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 5 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; 10 mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 3 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; 3 peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; and 2 indolent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, unclassified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One of 35 control patients had a breast implant placed before diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> associated with breast prostheses was 18.2 (95% confidence interval, 2.1-156.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest an association between <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> breast prostheses and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e>, although the absolute risk is exceedingly low due to the rare occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> of the breast (11 cases in The Netherlands in 17 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These findings require confirmation in other studies </plain></SENT>
