<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Characterization of the antibody with intracellular GR (iGR) showed its ability to shift [3H]triamcinolone acetonide-labeled GR (4S protein) from two human leukemic cell lines to a higher density in <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> gradients; Western and autoradiographic analysis of affinity-labeled ([3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> 21-mesylate) receptor revealed an immunoreactive and competitively labeled band of 94 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CCRF-CEM cell membrane GR (mGR) resolved as a &gt; 7S protein on density gradients and immunoselected cell surface protein labeled by whole cell biotinylation or affinity-labeling with [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> 21-mesylate was approximately 145 kDa, demonstrating that mGR was larger in size than iGR, as has been shown previously for the mGR of mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of mGR in lymphocytes of leukemic patients and the CCRF-CEM cell line indicated differences in levels of expression as shown by FACS and immunocytochemical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We are currently using this system to study the correlation between the quantity of membrane-resident GRs and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>-induced lytic response, a relationship previously shown in the murine (S-49 cell) system </plain></SENT>
