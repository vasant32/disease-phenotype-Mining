<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate pharmacodynamic differences among children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), DNPS was measured in leukemic blasts from newly diagnosed patients before and after therapy with these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive low-dose MTX (LDMTX: 6 oral doses of 30 mg/m(2)) or high-dose MTX (HDMTX: intravenous 1 g/m(2)) followed by intravenous MP; or intravenous MP alone (1 g/m(2)), as initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, the rate of DNPS in bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells was 3-fold higher in patients with T-lineage ALL compared with those with B-lineage ALL (769 +/- 189 vs 250 +/- 38 fmol/nmol/h; P =.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNPS was not consistently inhibited following MP alone but was markedly inhibited following MTX plus MP (median decrease 3% vs 94%; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LDMTX plus MP and HDMTX plus MP produced greater antileukemic effects (percentage decrease in circulating leukocyte counts) compared with MP alone (-50% +/- 4%, -56% +/- 3%, and - 20% +/- 4%, respectively; P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Full DNPS inhibition was associated with greater antileukemic effects compared with partial or no inhibition (-63% +/- 4% vs -37% +/- 4%; P &lt;.0001) in patients with nonhyperdiploid B-lineage and T-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HDMTX plus MP yielded 2-fold higher MTX <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53376">polyglutamate</z:chebi> concentrations than LDMTX plus MP (2148 +/- 298 vs 1075 +/- 114 pmol/10(9) cells; P &lt;.01) and a higher percentage of patients with full DNPS inhibition (78% vs 53%; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the extent of DNPS inhibition was related to in vivo antileukemic effects, and a single dose of intravenous MP produced minimal DNPS inhibition and antileukemic effects, whereas MTX plus MP produced greater antileukemic effects and DNPS inhibition, with full inhibition more frequent after HDMTX </plain></SENT>
