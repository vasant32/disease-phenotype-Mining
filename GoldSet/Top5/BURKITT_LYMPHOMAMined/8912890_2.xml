<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the antibody-induced effect of cross-linking the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) in human T leukemic cells (Jurkat) and human B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (Solubo, Burkitts <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) on intracellular [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increase in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i after MHC-I cross-linking in Jurkat cells and Solubo cells was dependent on both intra- and extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial increase was dependent on intracellular stores but the long-term elevated [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i level was due to an influx of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release and influx was different in the two cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both cell lines the increase in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i after MHC-I cross-linking caused upregulation of CD69, an early marker of activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When studying the effect of MHC-I cross-linking on the TCR- and B cell antigen receptor (BCR)- mediated increase in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i, respectively, we observed that MHC-I had a costimulatory effect on the TCR-mediated increase in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i in Jurkat cells but not on the anti-IgM-mediated activity of Solubo cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies of subpopulations of Jurkat and Solubo cells expressing different levels of MHC-I on their cell surfaces revealed that the TCR- and BCR-mediated increases in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i, respectively, were positively correlated with the level of MHC-I expressed on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest two different roles in signal transduction for the MHC-I molecules in the T and B cells studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>First, by themselves MHC-I complexes are able to induce activation of intracellular second messenger systems following cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Second, threshold levels for activation through antigen receptors in T and B cells are dependent on or determined by the actual numbers of MHC-I complexes present in the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus the present data strongly point to a new, physiological role for MHC-I molecules in T and B cells </plain></SENT>
