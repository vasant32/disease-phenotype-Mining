<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have determined the levels of cellular DNA polymerases and Epstein-Barr virus specific DNA polymerase in three Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines producing varying amounts of EBV, one of which was induced by 12-0-tetra-decanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was a proportional increase in the level of EBV-DNA polymerase with an increase in the percent of virus-producing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there was a reciprocal relationship between the levels of EBV-DNA polymerase and DNA polymerase alpha i.e., in cell line containing the highest level of EBV-DNA polymerase, activity of DNA polymerase alpha, but not of DNA polymerase beta, was reduced to an insignificantly low level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> does not have any direct effect on activities of either EBV-DNA polymerase or DNA polymerase alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBV-DNA polymerases isolated from cells grown with or without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> are indistinguishable in their properties such as elution position on phosphocellulose column, molecular weight, mono and divalent cation requirements, pH optimum, and other requirements for optimum activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Addition of crude extracts of cells grown in presence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> to the purified DNA polymerase alpha did not inhibit its activity indicating that the observed loss was not due to any specific inhibitor present in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Raji, a nonproducer cell line, did not contain EBV-DNA polymerase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no induction of EBV-DNA polymerase when Raji cells were grown in presence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The phenomenon of reduction in the levels of DNA polymerase alpha in cells induced to produce EBV may represent a mechanism by which the host DNA replication is shut off following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
