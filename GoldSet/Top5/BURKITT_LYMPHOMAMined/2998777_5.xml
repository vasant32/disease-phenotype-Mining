<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show here that highly purified preparations of platelet EIF exhibit growth-promoting activity for NIH 3T3 cells maintained in platelet-poor plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-inducing activity and growth-promoting activity co-elute upon gel chromatography under non-dissociating as well as dissociating conditions and co-migrate in <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-gel electrophoresis, supporting the notion that both activities reside on the same molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, both activities require a pH shock for full activity and act in the same concentration range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The growth-promoting activity of EIF can be differentiated from that of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), biologically (on the basis of differential response of cell lines to both factors), biochemically (on the basis of differences in isoelectric points and mol. wts. and the requirement of EIF to become activated by a pH shock) and by the lack of inhibition of EIF by antibody to PDGF </plain></SENT>
