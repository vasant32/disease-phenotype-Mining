<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The idiotypic determinants of a B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> could provide a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific target for vaccinating patients against their B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several approaches for inducing idiotype-specific immunization have been reported, but their major theoretical focus was related to the induction of humoral immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated an immunization procedure with naked DNA encoding human variable region gene sequences of an immunoglobulin heavy chain (VH), which may generate both humoral and cellular immune responses against the idiotype of a B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, we investigated heavy chain variable region genes obtained from an ALL patient and whether they could induce humoral and cellular immune responses in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The VH sequence was cloned into a mammalian expression vector for intradermal DNA vaccination and into a <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> expression vector to obtain VH protein for Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mammalian expression vector encoding the VH gene was injected into mice three times at 7-day intervals and was transduced into P1HTR which is a syngeneic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2, to serve as target cells to detect cellular immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spleen cells from the inoculated mice exhibited a significant cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to the target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By Western blotting, we could also detect trace levels of anti-VH antibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mice serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This approach for the induction of cellular immunity by intradermal injection is easy and variable region-specific, and may be used as vaccines after chemotherapy treatment of B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
