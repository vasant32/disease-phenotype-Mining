<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To better understand the relationship between the proliferation of human lymphoid cells and the expression of cdk1, a catalytic subunit of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H1 kinase (H1K), we examined its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein content in 3 B-cell lines: Ramos, Reh-6 and IARC 963 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells were elutriated according to their position in the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell fractions were analyzed for cdk1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein cellular content by Northern blot and immunoblot, respectively, as well as for H1K activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein amounts and H1K activity varied according to cell cycle phase, the lowest values being observed in G1-enriched fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For comparison, elutriated fractions were also tested for the expression of cdk2 and cdk4 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both showed some variations among fractions, but they were less clear than those of cdk1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also tested 29 samples of lymphoid neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues for proliferative activity (percentage of S and G2/M cells estimated by flow cytometry) and expression of cdk1, cdk2 and cdk4 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found a significant correlation between the percentage of cells in S or S + G2/M phases and cdk1 protein content but not cdk2 or cdk4 content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that cdk1 expression in human lymphoid cells varies during the cell cycle at both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
