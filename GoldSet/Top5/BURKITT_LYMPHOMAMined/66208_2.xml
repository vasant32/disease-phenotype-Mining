<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>P3HR-1 and EBV superinfected Raji cells served as targets for labelled sera from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, NPC and IM or from healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>125I peroxidase-labelled antibodies were also prepared to determine, autoradiographically, the penetration of the complex into the cell system, and to monitor the incubation and washing procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The development of a gentle sedimentation technique proved critical in handling the fragile target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VCA and MA were readily identified and localized by both procedures without significant modification of the basic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indentification of early antigens by IP required modification of the fixation method to include a brief treatment in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="15347">acetone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diffuse early antigen (EAD) was found to be associated with cellular ribosomes </plain></SENT>
