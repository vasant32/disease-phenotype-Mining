<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A complex chromosome rearrangement present in a B-cell line established from a patient with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was studied by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunocytochemistry techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rearranged chromosome (der17) was apparently composed of 17q, of a partially deleted 17p, and of other material of chromosome 17p origin that was interspersed with regions without any clear banding pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>der(17) contained a functional ch17 centromere and two additional centromeres of unknown origin that were inactive by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By FISH analysis with a TP53 probe, a signal could be demonstrated on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ch17, but not on the rearranged chromosome, a finding which indicates that 17p deletion caused a concurrent loss of one of the two TP53 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The marker chromosome was previously observed in some of the malignant cells obtained from the patient's peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations therefore indicate that cells with this specific rearrangement were generated in vivo and subsequently selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This rearrangement is likely to have conferred a selective growth advantage to a subclone present in the original malignant cell population </plain></SENT>
