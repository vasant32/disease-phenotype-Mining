<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This observation made by using monoclonal vimentin antibody V9 and a sensitive immunoperoxidase technique led to the investigation of vimentin expression in an unselected series of 73 immunohistochemically proven B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> regularly expressed vimentin, the neoplastic population of mixed, small and large, and large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> often contained various proportions of vimentin-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells or failed to express it at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Against the background of the Lukes-Collins classification and the Kiel classification, both defining and subdividing follicular center-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, there were statistically highly significant correlations between the absence of vimentin and the histology, suggesting a germinal center origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that loss of vimentin expression is indicative of the transient, follicular center-cell stage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant B lymphocytic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The complete absence of vimentin within the neoplastic population of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases examined may serve as an argument for its follicular center stage of differentiation, as was asserted by Lukes and Collins </plain></SENT>
