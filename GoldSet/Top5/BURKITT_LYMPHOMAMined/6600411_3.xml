<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Scanning electron microscopy and immunologic methods, to detect the expression of a variety of surface markers, were performed on cells from 36 established human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-lymphoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Attempts were made to correlate the surface morphologic findings with the membrane phenotype as determined by the presence or absence of a number of specific antigens and B- or T-cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the cell lines were of the T-lymphoid type, 15 B-derived, and eight were defined as non-B non-T in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the lines derived from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) had similar surface topographies and generally displayed relatively smooth surfaces with few microvilli, while in some a proportion of moderately villous cells was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells tended to show more villous surfaces but, similar to circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cells, variable numbers of microvilli were frequently seen making consistent distinctions between this and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemias</z:hpo> difficult in individual cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the non-B non-T lines are known to be of erythroid (K-562) and myeloid origin (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both these lines, cells with relatively few microprojections dominated; however, some showed transverse ridge-like profiles, a feature frequently encountered on circulating leukemic cells of myeloid type </plain></SENT>
