<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We aimed to describe computed tomography (CT) findings in patients with peritoneal, omental and mesenteric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched our archive retrospectively to find out patients with peritoneal, omental and mesenteric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found 16 patients with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> meeting these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT studies of these patients were reevaluated for the presence of peritoneal involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo>, omental mass, organomegaly, retroperitoneal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, bowel wall thickening and other associated findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 14 males and 2 females with peritoneal and/or mesenteric and omental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 39 (range 4-76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroups of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=11), small cell lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=2), small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=1), T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=1) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peritoneal involvement was seen in 15 patients (93.8%) in the form of linear (n=12) and nodular (n=3) thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>Ascites</z:hpo> was seen in 12 (75%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Omental and mesenteric masses were present in 10 (66.6%) and 10 (66.6%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bowel wall thickening, retroperitoneal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> were also common and observed in 10, 10 and 11 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Solid organ involvement in the form of liver and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096307" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">splenic lesions</z:e> was seen in 9 (56%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Peritoneal involvement can be seen in many subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and most frequently in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Peritoneal lymphomatosis can mimic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> and should be included in the differential diagnosis list in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo>, hepatosplenic lesions and unidentified cause of peritoneal thickening on CT in a male patient </plain></SENT>
