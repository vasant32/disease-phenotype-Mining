<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment has been based upon appreciation of rapid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> kinetics and has consisted of high-dose fractionated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> courses, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, adriamycin and infusions of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (Ara-C) with intrathecal chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
