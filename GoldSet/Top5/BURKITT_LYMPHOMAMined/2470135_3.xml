<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The degradation of a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) bound to surface IgM (sIgM) was studied in three human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The panel included MoAb that recognize several distinct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> associated with the F(c mu)5 domain, the c mu 2 domain and kappa or lambda light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amount of degraded MoAb and the rate of their degradation varied considerably between the various antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Properties of MoAb such as avidity or ability to cross-link sIgM did not significantly influence their degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most consistent correlation between rate of degradation and MoAb used was the location of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> recognized by the individual MoAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, 7 out of 8 anti-light chain MoAb were degraded at a higher rate than 5 out of 5 anti-F(c mu)5 MoAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One anti-c mu 2 MoAb was degraded at a rate similar to the majority of anti-light chain MoAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intracellular transport of an anti-kappa light chain MoAb and an anti-F(c mu)5 MoAb was studied in detail by subcellular fractionation in <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> gradients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that the anti-kappa light chain MoAb was transported more rapidly to lysosomes than the anti-F(c mu)5 MoAb, showing that they were sorted differently intracellularly </plain></SENT>
