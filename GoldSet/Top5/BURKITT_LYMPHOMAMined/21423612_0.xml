<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most studies to date have neglected time dimension and focus instead on the "average" spatial pattern of disease risk, thereby masking time trajectories of disease risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we propose a new idea titled "spatio-temporal kernel density estimation (stKDE)" that employs hybrid kernel (i.e., weight) functions to evaluate the spatio-temporal disease risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This approach not only can make full use of sample data but also "borrows" information in a particular manner from neighboring points both in space and time via appropriate choice of kernel functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed method performs substantially better than the traditional (i.e., frequency-based) kernel density estimation (trKDE) which has been used in applied settings while two illustrative examples demonstrate that the proposed approach can yield superior results compared to the popular trKDE approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, there exist various possibilities for improving and extending this method </plain></SENT>
