<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, some varieties of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients were located through MS databases for (a) Barking and Havering, NE London; catchment approximately 400,000; MS patient number 751, and (b) Nottingham, catchment approximately 2,000,000; MS patient number 1,236 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Search was undertaken for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or NPC and diagnosis of MS verified by McDonald criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified five UK-born and resident patients of interest: (1) male with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> aged 20 years developing relapsing-remitting MS 11 years later; (2) female with severe relapsing-remitting MS whose partner developed NHL, 5 years after MS diagnosis; (3) female with secondary progressive MS beginning at age 38 years who developed NHL 25 years later; (4) female diagnosed with MS aged 19 years who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> 4 years later, and (5) female with hereditary motor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> at the age of 32 years, NPC at 33 years, and RR MS at 36 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study supports a possible association between MS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, NHL, and perhaps NPC <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
