<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the genetic lesions that occur in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, besides the pathognomonic IG-MYC translocations, is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-nine molecularly-defined Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were analyzed with high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism chips for genomic imbalances and <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imbalances were correlated to expression profiles and selected micro-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Translocations affecting the MYC locus were studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We detected 528 copy number changes, defining 29 recurrently imbalanced regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five hundred and eighteen regions of <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> were found, but these were rarely recurrent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combined imbalance mapping and expression profiling revealed a strong correlation between copy number and expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several recurrent imbalances affected the MYC pathway: the micro-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-supercluster 17-92 was frequently gained and the transcription factor E2F2 was recurrently deleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lacking MYC translocations showed MYC gains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Amplifications of the polymerase iota gene were associated with increased frequency of positions scored as aberrant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomies</z:mp> do not play a major role in the pathogenesis of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, whereas some genes may contribute to the development of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> through gene dosage effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Amplifications of the polymerase iota gene may be functionally linked with increased genomic alterations in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The pattern and rarity of chromosomal changes detectable, even at the high resolution employed here, together with aberrations of genes regulating MYC activity, support the hypothesis that deregulation of the MYC pathway is the major force driving the pathogenesis of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but show that this deregulation is more complex than previously known </plain></SENT>
