<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here that: (i) antisense transcription occurs at the murine c-myc locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its biological significance remains to be established; (ii) transcription of both genes is regulated in various situations by a block to elongation of nascent <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the case of c-myc, the blockade involves a <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> structure whose nature remains unknown; (iii) elements responsible for the high degree of instability of c-myc and c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> reside in their 3' non-coding regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A U-rich region, reminiscent of that present in the granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> destabilizer, is likely to be involved in the rapid degradation of c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>; (iv) exon 1 substitution by intron 1-derived sequences lessens or negates the effect of the 3' destabilizer in abnormal c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
