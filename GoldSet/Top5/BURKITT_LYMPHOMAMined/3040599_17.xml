<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Specific antibody responses against the 2 major subcomponents of EBNA, EBNA1 and EBNA2 were evaluated, in order to study whether this serological study was beneficial compared to classical EBV serology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During this investigation, 491 sera, obtained from blood donors and patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (IM), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, renal transplantation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> and Human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>Immunodeficiency</z:hpo> Virus (HIV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the anti-EBNA1 response followed the classical anti-EBNA/Raji response (99% of anti-EBNA/Raji-positive sera also recognize EBNA1), the anti-EBNA2 response was much less frequent and did not correlate with either anti-EBNA/Raji or anti-EA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a control population, 8% of individuals had antiEBNA2 antibodies at titers greater than or equal to 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage was 45% in NPC and 38% in EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>; thus, although not detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, anti-EBNA2 serology might be a useful marker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and NPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No antibody was detected in the early course of IM, but in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> and in HIV-infected patients, the percentage of positive individuals reached 54 and 68, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seroconversion to EBNA2 was noted in a few cases, including renal transplant recipients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients, and complicated IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that in these situations, EBNA 2 serology might represent a useful marker related to modulation of the immune status or EBV reactivation </plain></SENT>
