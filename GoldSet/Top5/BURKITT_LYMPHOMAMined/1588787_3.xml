<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clonogenic assay was performed in 12 of the 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, four patients had a germline configuration of the IgH chain gene, showing a dissociation between phenotypic and genotypic expression; three patients had Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunogenotypic manifestation in Ph+ ALL does not depend on whether the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells had rearrangement within the major breakpoint cluster region (major-BCR) DNA sequence or the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells had myeloid-associated antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colony assay using various recombinant cytokines demonstrated that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells from four of 12 patients formed colonies in response to myelopoietic stimulants; three of the four patients were major-BCR-rearranged Ph+ ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, cells from one patient with Ph+ ALL formed colonies on the addition of granulocytic colony-stimulating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This indicates not only the biological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of ALL cells but also that some of the characteristics of the cells are related to specific chromosome changes </plain></SENT>
