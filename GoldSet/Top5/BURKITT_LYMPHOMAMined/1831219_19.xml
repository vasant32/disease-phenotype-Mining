<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cells comprise a very small subset of TCR-gamma delta+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD4+ TCR gamma delta+ T cell clones were established to study the phenotypical and functional characteristics of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones were established after sorting CD4+ T cells from a pre-expanded TCR-gamma delta+ T cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These clones as well as the CD4- TCR-gamma delta+ T cells from the same donor used V gamma 2 and V delta 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second cloning experiment CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cells were cloned directly from freshly isolated TCR-gamma delta+ T cells using a cloning device coupled to a FACS sorter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-three clones were obtained, which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> expressed CD4 and TCR-gamma delta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven of these clones used V delta 1 and three of them coexpressed V gamma 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones used both V delta 2 and V gamma 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones expressed CD28 irrespective of the V gamma or V delta usage, and were CD11b negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three CD4-CD8+ TCR-gamma delta+ clones expressed CD8 alpha but not CD8 beta and were CD11b positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD28 expression among CD4-CD8+ and CD4-CD8- was variable but lower than on CD4+ T cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CD4- TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones using V gamma 2 and V delta 2 specifically lyse the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Daudi and secrete low levels of IFN-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF upon stimulation with Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, most CD4+ T cell clones that use V gamma 2 and V delta 2 had a very low lytic activity against Daudi cells and secrete high levels of IFN-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF after stimulation with Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The NK-sensitive cell line K562 was killed efficiently by the CD4- TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones, but not by CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones, and could not induce cytokine secretion in CD4+ or CD4- T cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones, but not the CD4- clones, could provide bystander cognate T cell help for production of IgG, IgM, and IgA in the presence of IL-2 and IgE in the presence of IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cells are similar to CD4+ TCR-alpha <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30225">beta+</z:chebi> T cells in their abilities to secrete high levels of cytokines and to provide T cell help in antibody production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
