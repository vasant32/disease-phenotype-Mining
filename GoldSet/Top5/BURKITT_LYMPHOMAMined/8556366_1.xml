<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> of mature, immunoglobulin (Ig)-bearing B cells characterized by translocation between c-myc and Ig gene loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A role for the juxtaposed Ig genes in the mutation and deregulation of c-myc expression typical of endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (eBL) has been proposed, but never proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to determine whether Ig gene hypermutation is ongoing in eBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We isolated Ig heavy-chain sequences from K962 eBL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells using reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PCR product was ligated into Bluescript II vectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple subclones were sequenced and the variable regions were compared for evidence of ongoing Ig hypermutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six total single base substitutions were observed within four of the nine subclones studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four substitutions resulted in amino acid changes and two were silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no clustering of mutations in hypervariable regions, or a high incidence of amino acid replacement or link substitutions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which are characteristic of Ig hypermutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observed mutations occurred at a rate consistent with Taq polymerase error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that in the eBL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sample K962, the mechanism underlying c-myc mutation is distinct from that which gives rise to Ig hypermutation </plain></SENT>
