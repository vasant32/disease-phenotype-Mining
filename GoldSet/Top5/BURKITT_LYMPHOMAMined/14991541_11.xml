<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the World Health Organization classification system, 1983 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at Siriraj Hospital were classified as either non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) (92.1%) or Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) (7.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NHL cases were 75% B cell type and 25% T cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, unspecified peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, precursor T lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> accounted for 84.3% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL cases found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mixed cellularity and nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> types constituted 77.7% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> cases found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An overall male preponderance was observed, but sex distribution differed among various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and a female preponderance was observed in the elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in the frequency of B-cell NHL by age were characteristic: &lt;50% in the first decade of life, a further decrease in the second decade, &gt;60% in the third decade, and increases thereafter, reaching 90% after the seventh decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High frequency of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Bangkok but low frequency in the Northeastern region and high frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> in the Southern region were significant (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extranodal involvement was observed in 58.7% of NHLs, commonly affecting the upper aerodigestive tract and gastrointestinal tract, with some differences in geographical distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher frequencies of T-cell NHLs involving extranodal sites and of B-cell NHLs involving lymph nodes were significant (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The distribution of various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and comparison with other large series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> further demonstrates the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of this disease </plain></SENT>
