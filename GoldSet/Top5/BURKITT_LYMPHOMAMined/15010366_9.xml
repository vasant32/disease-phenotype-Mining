<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the association between rearrangement patterns based on updated databases and clinical characteristics of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 381 IgH sequences identified at presentation in 317 children with B-lineage ALL and assessed the V(H)D(H)J(H) gene utilization profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The D(H)J(H)-proximal V(H) segments and the D(H)2 gene family were significantly overrepresented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 21% of V(H)-J(H) joinings were potentially productive, a finding associated with a trend toward an increased risk of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that physical location at the V(H) locus is involved in preferential usage of D(H)J(H)-proximal V(H) segments whereas D(H) and J(H) segment usage is governed by position-independent molecular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular pathophysiology appears relevant to clinical outcome in patients who have only productive rearrangements, and specific rearrangement patterns are associated with differences in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
