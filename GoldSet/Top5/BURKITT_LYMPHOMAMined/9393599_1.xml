<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of lamins is a key factor in the regulation of nuclear structure during the cell cycle and of gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since an uncontrolled cell cycle and altered gene transcription are major characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, we looked for differences in lamin B2 phosphorylation between PBMC, ALL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using different lamin B2-specific antibodies, we detected two different lamin B2 species termed lamin B2 and B2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although phosphorylation of lamin B2 in leukemic cells was reminiscent of resting cells, the majority of ALL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> samples showed significantly higher and more altered lamin B2A phosphorylation compared to PBMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It remains to be elucidated which mechanism leads to these alterations and whether it could explain the extended G1-phase frequently observed in ALL cells </plain></SENT>
