<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We modified and tested a new technique to isolate individual nuclei from tissue cores of paraffin-embedded tissue processed with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27338">xylene</z:chebi>, proteinase K, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="30769">citric acid</z:chebi>, and pepsin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of this method to study paraffin-embedded tissue was investigated in six <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymph nodes or tonsils and 32 malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> including five mantle cell, five follicular, five Burkitt, five extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, five anaplastic large-cell, and seven diffuse large B-cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fusion of CCND1 and IgH, BCL2 and IgH, c-myc and IgH, and MALT1 and API2 were detected using probes with a dual-fusion FISH strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anomalies involving ALK and BCL6 were detected using break-apart FISH probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH studies were successful for each of the 38 specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosome anomalies were detected in each malignant specimen, but not in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The correct chromosome anomaly was detected in 22 of 22 specimens with genetic abnormalities that were established by other genetic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This FISH technique is useful to detect chromosome anomalies with high sensitivity and specificity in paraffin-embedded tissue and may provide important diagnostic and prognostic genetic information </plain></SENT>
