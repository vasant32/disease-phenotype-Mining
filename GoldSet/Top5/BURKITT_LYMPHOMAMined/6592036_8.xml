<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of the 16 patients had no B-cell markers, but the erythrocyte marker--glycophorin A--was present on the surface of the leukemic blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The critical breakpoint at 8q24 was detected in 14 of the 16 patients, whereas this aberration was not detected in any of the 134 patients belonging to other subgroups of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or ALL that we studied during the same period </plain></SENT>
