<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the effectiveness of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) Rituximab (C2B8) in the treatment of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, its efficacy remains variable and often modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It seems likely that a combination of multiple mechanisms, such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and apoptotic signaling, underlies the therapeutic success of anti-CD20 mAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the current anti-CD20 mAbs effective in CDC are relatively inactive in signaling cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we developed two genetically engineered tetravalent antibodies (TetraMcAb) respectively derived from the anti-CD20 mAbs C2B8 and 2F2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TetraMcAbs, with a molecular mass only 25 kDa higher than native divalent antibodies (DiMcAb), were shown not only to be as effective in mediating CDC and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells as DiMcAbs but also to have antiproliferative and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing activity markedly superior to that of DiMcAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, whereas 2F2 and C2B8 were equally effective in inducing cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, the functions of their tetravalent versions, 2F2(ScFvHL)(4)-Fc and C2B8(ScFvHL)(4)-Fc, were significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2F2(ScFvHL)(4)-Fc exhibited exceptionally more potent antiproliferative and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing activity than that of C2B8(ScFvHL)(4)-Fc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunotherapeutic studies further showed that 2F2(ScFvHL)(4)-Fc was far more effective in prolonging the survival of severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing systemic Daudi or Raji <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> than C2B8, 2F2, and C2B8(ScFvHL)(4)-Fc, suggesting that it might be a promising therapeutic agent for B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
