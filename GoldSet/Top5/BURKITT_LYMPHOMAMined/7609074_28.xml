<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that Fp is exclusively a lytic promoter which was incorrectly identified as the EBNA 1 gene promoter in group 1 BL cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is shown that while Fp activity was observed in two group 1 BL cell lines, it could not be detected in a third group 1 BL cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the level of Fp activity detected in both group 1 and group 3 cell lines appeared to correlate only with the level of spontaneous lytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Induction of the lytic cycle in group 1 or group 3 BL cell lines resulted in a dramatic increase in Fp-initiated transcripts but no detectable increase in EBNA 1 transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Anti-immunoglobulin induction of the lytic cycle in the Akata group 1 BL cell line revealed that induction of Fp activity was detectable by 2 to 4 h after induction of the lytic cycle and was dependent on de novo protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In addition, Fp reporter constructs transiently transfected into group 1 BL cell lines exhibited activity which was independent of the Fp initiation site, TATAA box, or other upstream sequences </plain></SENT>
