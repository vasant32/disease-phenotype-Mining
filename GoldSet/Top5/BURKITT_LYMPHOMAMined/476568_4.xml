<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three established culture lines (carried in vitro for greater than 3 years and passaged greater than 200 times) that contained aneuploid karyotypes were composed of oval cells with numerous interdigitating surface microvilli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nuclei were complex and convoluted with multiple large nucleoli and dispersed chromatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytoplasm contained lysosomes, microfilaments, a complex Golgi apparatus, nondilated rough endoplasmic reticulum, polyribosomes, fat, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> monolayer with aneuploid chromosomes examined from the 4th to 48th passage in culture was composed of larger cells with fewer microvilli and numerous multinuclear giant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two monolayers derived from transplanted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice inoculated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> cultured cells were similar to the original cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructural features of these 6 cultures with aneuploid karyotypes differed from those of 3 monolayers which, although prepared from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> splenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, were composed of fibroblastic cells with diploid chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aneuploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> cultures did not resemble 6 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spleen, thymus, or lung monolayers, Raji lymphoblastoid suspension cultures, or Hela cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our electron microscopic studies indicate that adherent cells which replicate in some monolayer tissue cultures derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are related to and possibly derived from neoplastic macrophages </plain></SENT>
