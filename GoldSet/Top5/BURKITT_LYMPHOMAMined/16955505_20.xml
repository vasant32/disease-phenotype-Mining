<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported a more favorable outcome for teenagers and young adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) when they were treated in pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> departments compared with adult hematology departments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, biased risk grouping and high treatment-related mortality have hampered some of those comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In Sweden during the 1990s, adolescents with ALL were treated in a pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> unit or in an adult hematologic unit, depending on the initial referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current national, comparative, retrospective study, patients with ALL aged 10 years to 40 years who were treated either according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> (NOPHO) ALL protocol (1992-2000) (NOPHO-92 protocol) or according to the Swedish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Adult ALL</z:e> Group protocol (1994-2000) (Adult protocol) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the protocols had age as a high-risk criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 243 patients with B-precursor and T-cell ALL were treated according to the protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the remission rate between the NOPHO-92 protocol (99%; n = 144 patients) and the Adult protocol (90%; n = 99 patients; P &lt; .01), and the event-free survival (EFS) was also superior for the NOPHO-92 protocol compared with the Adult protocol (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, EFS was higher for patients aged 15 years to 25 years compared with patients aged 26 years to 40 years within the Adult protocol group (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment protocol itself was identified as an independent risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The NOPHO-92 protocol resulted in a better outcome than the Adult protocol; therefore, adolescents may benefit from the pediatric protocol treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prospective trials are warranted to determine whether young adults would benefit from similar treatment </plain></SENT>
