<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1) and its germline counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rearranged gene which stems from a lymphoid cell line and the germline gene differ in four <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> which can be attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo>; three of the mutations are clustered in CDR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The germline gene regions of two unrelated individuals were identical over a stretch of 1267 bp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By hybridization experiments it is shown that the human K locus contains only one VKIV gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 16 lymphoid cell lines studied here, the VKIV gene is frequently deleted or aberrantly rearranged which may be a consequence of peculiarities of its function and/or its structural organization </plain></SENT>
