<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients failed to express surface immunoglobulin (sIg) and kappa or lambda light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on initial immunophenotyping results consistent with B-precursor ALL, four of these cases were initially treated with conventional ALL chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These four patients were switched to B cell ALL treatment protocols once cytogenetic results became available revealing the 8;14 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fifth case was treated with B cell ALL therapy from the outset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of the five patients are in complete remission at 64, 36, 29 and 13 months from diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient relapsed and died 6 months after initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These five unusual cases with clinical B cell ALL, the t(8;14), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">FAB L3</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, but negative sIg, demonstrate the importance of careful and multidisciplinary evaluation of leukemic cells with <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping and cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future identification of patients with this profile will allow us to expand our knowledge regarding prognostic significance and optimal treatment for this rare subgroup of patients </plain></SENT>
