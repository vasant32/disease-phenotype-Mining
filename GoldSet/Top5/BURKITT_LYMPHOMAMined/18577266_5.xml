<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ML frequency, pathogenicity, clinical patterns and possible association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> in Tanzania, are not well documented impeding the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sections of 176 archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsies of ML patients at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH)/Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS), Tanzania from 1996-2001 were stained for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin and selected (70) cases for expression of pan-leucocytic (CD45), B-cell (CD20), T-cell (CD3), Hodgkin/RS cell (CD30), histiocyte (CD68) and proliferation (Ki-67) antigen markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Corresponding clinical records were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Available sera from 38 ML patients were screened (ELISA) for HIV antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of ML out of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> at MNH during the 6 year period was 4.2% (176/4200) comprising 77.84% non-Hodgkin (NHL) including 19.32% Burkitt's (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and 22.16% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ML <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> frequency increased from 0.42% (1997) to 0.70% (2001) and 23.7% of tested sera from these patients were HIV positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ML was 30, age-range 3-91 and peak age was 1-20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The male:female ratio was 1.8:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Supra-diaphragmatic presentation was commonest and histological sub-types were mostly aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> however, no clear cases of primary effusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PEL) and primary central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PCNSL) were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> apparently, increased significantly among diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> at MNH between 1996 and 2001, predominantly among the young, HIV infected and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequent aggressive clinical and histological presentation as well as the dominant B-immunophenotype and the HIV serology indicate a pathogenic association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, routine HIV screening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients at MNH is necessary to enable comprehensive ARL diagnosis and formulation of preventive and therapeutic protocols </plain></SENT>
