<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>5-aza-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> (5-aza-C) is an analogue that reduces <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> methylation in DNA (Jones and Taylor, 1980) and has been reported to change the differentiation pattern of cultured mouse embryo cells (Taylor and Jones, 1979) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have tested its ability to activate the Epstein-Barr virus cycle in latently EBV-infected human lymphoid lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After an incubation period of 6 to 8 h with the drug, early antigens (EA) were induced in a substantial fraction of the cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six lines tested that had a low rate of spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigen production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Optimal conditions for EA induction were defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of 5-aza-C was comparable to the inducing effect of iododeoxyuridine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBV-DNA and EBNA positive virus-non-producer lines did not respond to 5-aza-C treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings are discussed in relation to the possibility that changes in EBV-gene expression may be related to the state of DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
