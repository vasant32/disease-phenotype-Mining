<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purified NF-kappa B has been identified as a 51-kDa <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> by UV-crosslinking analysis. "Footprint" and methylation-interference analyses have shown that purified NF-kappa B has a binding activity specific for the kappa light chain enhancer sequence </plain></SENT>
