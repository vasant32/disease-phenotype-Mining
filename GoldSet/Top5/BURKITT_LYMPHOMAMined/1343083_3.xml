<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tumoral fragments taken at autopsy were frozen and studied by the Southern blot technique (SBT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other tumoral fragments were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin and used for in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) with biotinylated probes for DNA of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> was positive in each case with a spotty nuclear labelling of certain tumoral cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SBT evidenced a clonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, EBV DNA was detected in each frozen fragment with only one restriction pattern, indicating that the EBV- infected cell population was a clonal expansion of a progenitor cell </plain></SENT>
