<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although LMP1 is regarded as a potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated antigen for immunotherapy and several LMP1-specific MHC class I-restricted CTL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> have been reported, little is known regarding MHC class II-restricted CD4 helper T-lymphocyte (HTL) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> for LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present studies was to determine whether MHC class II-restricted CD4 T-cell responses could be induced against the LMP1 antigen and to evaluate the antitumor effect of these responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have combined the use of a predictive MHC class II binding <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> algorithm with in vitro vaccination of CD4 T cells using candidate <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> to identify naturally processed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> derived from LMP1 that elicit immune responses against EBV-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi> LMP1(159-175) was effective in inducing HTL responses that were restricted by HLA-DR9, HLA-DR53, or HLA-DR15, indicating that this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> behaves as a promiscuous T-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, LMP1(159-175)-reactive HTL clones directly recognized EBV lymphoblastoid B cells, EBV-infected natural killer (NK)/T-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and naturally processed antigen in the form of LMP1+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lysates presented by autologous dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because the newly identified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> LMP1(159-175) overlaps with an HLA-A2-restricted CTL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> (LMP1(159-167)), this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> might have the ability to induce simultaneous CTL and HTL responses against LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, our data should be relevant for the design and optimization of T-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>-based immunotherapy against various EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including NK/T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
