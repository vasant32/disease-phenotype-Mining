<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Globotriaosyl <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> (CD77), a marker for germinal center B-cells, is present on Daudi cells but is deficient in the Daudi-derived mutant VT500 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous results showed a correlation in these cells between CD77 expression and expression of the B-cell protein CD19 and indicated that CD19/CD77 interaction is a mechanism for B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Roles for CD77 in IFN-alpha-induced growth inhibition and anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> activity also have been described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Through flow cytometric analysis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> assays, we investigated whether expression of CD77 was required for cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> pathways induced by IFN or antibodies against additional B-cell surface molecules: CD20, CD22, CD38, CD40, CD81 and HLA-D proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the pronounced homotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> induced by treatment with interferon-alpha in Daudi cells, no increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> was observed in IFN-treated VT500 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the B-cell proteins tested, only CD22-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and surface expression was stronger in Daudi than in VT500 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that CD77 may be required for IFN and CD22-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> pathways, but CD77 is not a universal component of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> pathways in these cells </plain></SENT>
