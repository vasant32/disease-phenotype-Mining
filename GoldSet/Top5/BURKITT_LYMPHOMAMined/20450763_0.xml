<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical and pathologic findings of 38 cases of granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study was performed and the literature was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age of patients ranged from 2 to 77 years (mean = 43.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major clinical presentations included superficial lymph node enlargement and painful soft tissue mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were available in 18 patients; and 14 of them died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-related diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average duration of survival of the patients was 16.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were relatively uniform in appearance and small to medium in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cytoplasm was scanty and pale in color </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The nuclei were round or focally irregular, with fine chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mitosis figures were readily identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Scattered immature eosinophilic myelocytes were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study showed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases expressed MPO and CD43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Most cases were also positive for CD68, lysozyme, CD99 and TdT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The staining for CD3, CD20, CD79a, pan-cytokeratin and PLAP were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> is a known histologic mimicker of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Ewing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>/PNET and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006743'>embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Detailed morphologic examination, when coupled with immunohistochemical study, is useful in arriving at a correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
