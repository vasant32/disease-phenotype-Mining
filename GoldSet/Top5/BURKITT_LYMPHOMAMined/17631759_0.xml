<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinicopathologic features of 43 cases of primary NHL of the female genital system were studied retrospectively, with the histological classification based on the Classification of Haematopoietic and <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>Lymphoid Tumors</z:mp> (WHO, 2001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunochemistry technique, in-situ-hybridization and polymerase chain reaction methods were used to detect the immunophenotype, epstein barrvirus (EB) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> status and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Primary lesions</z:e>: there were 24 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> originating in the ovary, 3 cases in the endometrium, 10 cases in the cervix, 2 cases in the vagina and 4 cases in the vulva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) Staging: 12 cases (28%) were in stage I, 9 cases (21%) in stage II, and 22 cases (51%) in stage III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) Histological classification: 37 cases (86%) were diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), 3 cases were Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the remaining 3 cases were unspecified peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> according to biopsy, immunophenotype analysis, in-situ-hybridization technique and IgH gene rearrangement detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(4) Prognosis analysis: increase in the level of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="28358">lactic acid</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, stage III, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and single operation suggest poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Establishment of the diagnosis of primary NHL of the female genital system is based on biopsy, immunophenotype analysis, in-situ-hybridization technique and IgH gene rearrangement detection, which play important roles in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
