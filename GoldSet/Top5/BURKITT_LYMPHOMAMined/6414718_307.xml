<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have determined the sequence of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human c-myc gene and compared it to portions of a c-myc gene that has been translocated into the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc gene is encoded in three discrete exons divided by two large intervening sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is transcribed from two active promoters located about 150 nucleotides from one another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each promoter initiates transcription of a long (approximately 550 bp) untranslatable leader sequence encoding the entire first exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This exon and additional 5' flanking sequences are tightly conserved between mouse and man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the Burkitt cell BL22, the rearranged c-myc gene retains both promoters and is unchanged in its amino acid coding domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Translocation of this gene joins it to the immunoglobulin heavy chain switch region at a point approximately 1000 bp 5' to the dual c-myc promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These genes are joined in opposite transcriptional orientation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The structure of the translocated gene and the nature of its linkage to the immunoglobulin locus and the presence of two c-myc promoters and consequently two long leader sequences raise novel possibilities for the activation of an oncogene </plain></SENT>
