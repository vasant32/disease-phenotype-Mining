<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October 1986 to March 1990, 302 assessable patients, 0.6 to 17.8 years of age, with newly diagnosed NHL were enrolled onto study ALL/NHL-BFM 86 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of patients had Burkitt-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>; 24% had lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 18% had diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; and 8% had an NHL not further classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therapy group B included Burkitt's-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, and most large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> including Ki-1 anaplastic large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with stage I and II disease resected received three, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> others received six, 5-day therapy courses (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> [MTX] 0.5 g/m2 [5 g/m2 for stage IV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>], and intrathecal [IT] therapy in each course, plus ifosfamide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> alternating with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapy for group non-B patients (lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and pleomorphic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e>]) consisted of a Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster (BFM) <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> protocol, including cranial irradiation for advanced stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Local therapy was restricted to patients with incomplete <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The probabilities of event-free survival (pEFS) at 7 years were 80% +/- 2% for the whole group, 81% +/- 3% for group B (n = 225), and 78% +/- 5% for group non-B (n = 77) with a follow-up duration of 3.6 to 7 years (median 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment results were comparable between NHL subtypes, except for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e>, in which three of four patients suffered from relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Local disease</z:e> manifestations were the most frequent site of failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This therapy strategy provided patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL subtypes with an equally high chance to survive event-free, except patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With reduced systemic failure, local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> control may become more important </plain></SENT>
