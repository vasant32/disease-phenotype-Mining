<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the frequency of p53 mutations in B- and T-cell human lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, the major subtypes of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>p53 exons 5-9 were studied by using genomic DNA from 197 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and 27 cell lines by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations were found associated with (i) Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (9/27 biopsies; 17/27 cell lines) and its leukemic counterpart L3-type B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (5/9), both of which also carry activated c-myc oncogenes, and (ii) B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (6/40) and, in particular, its stage of progression known as Richter's transformation (3/7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations were not found at any significant frequency in other types of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In many cases, only the mutated allele was detectable, implying loss of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that (i) significant differences in the frequency of p53 mutations are present among subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> derived from the same tissue; (ii) p53 may play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>; (iii) the presence of both p53 loss/inactivation and c-myc oncogene activation may be important in the pathogenesis of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and its leukemic form L3-type B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
