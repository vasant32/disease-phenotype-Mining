<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>-labeling that the short (1 h) treatment of the REH6 cells with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> promoting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi>, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>), resulted in a rapid phosphorylation of at least three (P1, P2 and P3) stathmin isoforms without an alteration of stathmin isoform expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Western blot analysis with specific antiserum showed that the prolonged period (48 h) of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> treatment partially reduced protein levels particularly of two (N2 and P2) stathmin isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The potent and relatively specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, 1,(5-isoquinolinesulphonyl)2methylpiperasine dihydrochloride (H7), partially inhibited these <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> effects, whereas the specific calmodulin inhibitor R24571 (calmidazolium) had no effect upon these events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that stathmin phosphorylation in REH6 cells could be in part mediated by PKC activation </plain></SENT>
