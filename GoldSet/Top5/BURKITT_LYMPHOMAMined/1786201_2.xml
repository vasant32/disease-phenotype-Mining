<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such PBMC were called OK-432-activated mononuclear cells (OK-MC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OK-MC produce several kinds of cytokines such as interferon alpha (IFN alpha), IFN gamma, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> inhibitory factor (TGIF) both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OK-MC-produced cytokines also inhibited the growth of cultured and fresh human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The growth inhibition was examined by human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> clonogenic assay using a double-layer agar technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that two pathways of anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity are induced in OK-MC, i.e., cell-mediated and cytokine-mediated </plain></SENT>
