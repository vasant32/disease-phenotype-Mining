<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report downregulatory effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on allogeneic immune responses in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>G-CSF did not affect the proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) against allogeneic Daudi cells but did inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast with G-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF and interleukin (IL)-3 enhanced alloactivation-induced TNF-alpha production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>G-CSF-mediated suppression of TNF-alpha production was not affected by fixation of stimulators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>G-CSF did not inhibit TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression or accelerate <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> degradation, whereas pentoxifylline inhibited the expression of TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that G-CSF acts directly on responder cells and modulates TNF-alpha production at posttranscriptional levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Suppression of TNF-alpha secretion was accompanied by an increase of intracellular cyclic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cAMP) concentration in alloactivated PBMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cell-permeable cAMP analogue, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50095">dibutyryl cAMP</z:chebi>, suppressed TNF-alpha secretion without affecting TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>G-CSF showed an inhibitory effect on the development of cytotoxic effector cells against allogeneic Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody (MoAb) also inhibited the induction of cytolytic activity, and the inhibitory effects of G-CSF and anti-TNF-alpha MoAb on killer activity generation were overcome by adding exogenous TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hence, impaired generation of cytolytic effector cells by G-CSF is believed to be the result of reduced TNF-alpha production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the results described above suggest that G-CSF downregulates allogeneic immune responses by posttranscriptionally inhibiting TNF-alpha production </plain></SENT>
