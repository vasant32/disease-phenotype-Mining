<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Daudi line of human lymphoblastoid cells shows a high sensitivity towards growth inhibition by human interferons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In cells pretreated with 70 reference units/ml of an interferon preparation for 48 h, the incorporation of exogenous [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> into DNA is inhibited by as much as 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We are investigating the extent to which this effect reflects a true inhibition of the rate of DNA synthesis or whether it may be caused by changes in the metabolic utilization of exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> by the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interferon treatment results in a 30% inhibition of the rate of membrane transport and a 60% decrease in the rate of phosphorylation of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter effect is due to a decrease in V of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase without any change in the value of Km for this enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to these changes, incorporation of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> into DNA, which occurs as a result of the intracellular conversion of this precursor into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, is also inhibited by 75%, whereas <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> labelling by [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> is decreased by only 15% in interferon-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus several different metabolic events associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> nucleotide metabolism and DNA synthesis in Daudi cells are disrupted by interferon treatment </plain></SENT>
