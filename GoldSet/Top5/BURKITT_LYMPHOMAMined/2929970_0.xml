<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Central venous access ports or partly implanted <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> catheters are usually placed for high-dose chemotherapy in these children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report two patients aged 7 and 3 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>), a less common subtype of ALL, which presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> (38.4 degrees C and 39 degrees C) during anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> for implantation of a central venous catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hyperthermic reactions were accompanied by an increase in expired <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> as well as moderate elevation of heart rate and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As in both patients the history and preoperative findings did not reveal signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, the observed alterations were interpreted as symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002047'>malignant hyperthermia</z:hpo> triggered either by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45652">succinylcholine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>, which were used in both children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> responded to administration of dantrolene <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> according to dose recommendations for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002047'>malignant hyperthermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one of the patients, withdrawal of dantrolene during the initial postoperative hours was followed by a recurrent increase in body temperature, which once again could be suppressed by additional dantrolene infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the literature, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002047'>malignant hyperthermia</z:hpo> has occasionally been described in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our observations indicate that children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> may be especially susceptible to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002047'>malignant hyperthermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Close monitoring of body temperature and expiratory <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> are therefore indicated in these children, and dantrolene therapy should be started immediately in case of increased temperature during anesthesia </plain></SENT>
