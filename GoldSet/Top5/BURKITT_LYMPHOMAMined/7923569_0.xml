<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been demonstrated that N-alkylpurines produced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi> are excised more rapidly from actively transcribing genes compared to non-coding regions of the overall genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such studies have suggested that transcriptional activity is a determinant of the rate of removal of these DNA lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined the removal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi>-induced N-alkylpurines in the actively transcribed/translocated and transcriptionally repressed native alleles of the c-myc gene in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, CA46 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, exhibiting a c-myc translocation that can be distinguished from the native allele by Southern blotting, provide a useful model system in which to explore regulatory elements that govern DNA repair in transcriptionally active genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Northern analysis verified the selective allelic expression of the translocated c-myc gene in CA46 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the drug exposure examined, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi> produced a similar level of N-alkylpurines in the two alleles of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, the kinetics of lesion repair from both c-myc alleles over a 24 h repair incubation period was of the same order of magnitude: approximately 34% and approximately 25% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi>-induced N-alkylpurines were removed by 8 h; approximately 72% and approximately 66% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi> lesions were removed by 24 h from the untranslocated and translocated alleles respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The untranslocated allele did not become transcriptionally activated upon drug treatment and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi> produced a suppression of c-myc message levels from the translocated allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our results suggest that the rate of repair of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi>-induced N-alkylpurines is independent of transcriptional activity of the c-myc gene in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings are discussed in terms of the current views about the mechanisms of gene-specific repair </plain></SENT>
