<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9908">ursolic acid</z:chebi> was found to decrease cell viability in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Daudi cells in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>UA also induced morphological changes in cells as well as loss of membrane asymmetry, DNA fragmentation and nuclei condensation, indicating that the mechanism by which UA induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was through <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with UA increased intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel inhibitors like <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> blocked this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> influx and also the triggering of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the binding of UA to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptors and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> currents induced constituted the first steps of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
