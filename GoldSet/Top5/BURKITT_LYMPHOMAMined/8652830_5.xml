<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lym-1 is a murine IgG2a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a polymorphic variant of HLA-DR antigens on malignant B cells, with minimal cross-reactivity with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because it can be safely administered in vivo, a detailed knowledge of its ability to recruit and trigger the antitumor immune effector systems is required to optimize potential serotherapeutic approaches in B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using Raji cells as a model of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> targets, we found that Lym-1 activates complement-mediated lysis efficiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Lym-1 was capable of triggering the antibody-dependent cellular cytolysis (ADCC) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, it failed to trigger neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)-mediated ADCC activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to enhance Lym-1 ADCC by MNCs and PMNs, nine biologic response modifiers were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MNC-mediated Lym-1 ADCC was significantly stimulated by interleukin-2 (IL-2) and unaffected by other mediators, including gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor a (TNFalpha), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, PMN-mediated Lym-1 ADCC was induced or significantly augmented by various cytokines, such as GM-CSF, TNFalpha, and gamma-IFN, and chemotaxins, such as formyl <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">FMLP</z:chebi>), complement fragment C5a, and IL-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both MNC- and PMN-mediated ADCC was unaffected by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G- CSF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, only GM-CSF and TNFalpha augmented the number of PMNs actually engaged in the binding of Raji target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings presented here, in particular those showing stimulatory activity of biologic response modifiers, may inspire new attempts for developing Lym-1 antibody-based approaches to the therapy of B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
