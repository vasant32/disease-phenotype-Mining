<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (V(H)) gene in seven cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (sBL) to elucidate their cell of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, we focused on the V(H) gene status of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells involving adjacent germinal center (GC) by microdissecting histological sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the seven V(H) genes V(H)1 family was found in two, V(H)3 in four, and V(H)4 in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rearranged V(H) genes demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> at percentages ranging from 1.4 to 7.5% (mean, 4.2%), which is a similar level to that seen in IgM-only B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three out of four V(H) genes with more than 2% sequence difference from their corresponding germline counterpart showed evidence of antigen selection in their framework region 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three cases demonstrated signs of intraclonal diversity with a mutational frequency of 0.47-0.98%, which was 13.5-28.8 times as great as the Taq infidelity in our experimental conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> and the effect of antigen selection on V(H) gene were diverse in these three cases, and the relationship between V(H) gene <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> status and intraclonal diversity was unclear in sBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the analysis of microdissected tissues, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 tumor clones in the adjacent GCs showed additional replacement mutations in complementarity determining region 3, suggesting a role of antigen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding resembles the phenomenon that memory B-cells reenter into GC to undergo further affinity maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 7/11 V(H) gene sequences irrelevant to GC were identical to those of the major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus our findings suggested that sBL is derived from memory B-cells rather than GC B-cells, and that antigen stimulation is involved in the clonal expansion of a proportion of sBL </plain></SENT>
