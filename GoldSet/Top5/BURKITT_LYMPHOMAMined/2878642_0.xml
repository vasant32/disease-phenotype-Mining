<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These include the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo>, human papillomaviruses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e>, Epstein-Barr virus in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and human T-lymphotrophic virus in adult T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These pieces of evidence have accumulated from both clinical and basic studies which have shown that these viruses are involved in some stage of the carcinogenic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the rapid development of techniques and knowledge of molecular biology, most of the gene structures of these viruses and their products have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results make it possible to understand more clearly the route of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and have facilitated the production of vaccines, using DNA-recombinant techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in the incidence of these types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> is expected through prevention programs conducted throughout the general population against these viruses within 10 to 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These virus-related human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> also provide us with a good opportunity to understand the basic mechanisms involved in the development of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, these points are stressed in addition to describing the recent progress made in the study on virus-related human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
