<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possibility of using radioiodine labeled framework region (FR) antisense oligonucleotides (ASONs) as an imaging agent or antisense therapeutic radiopharmaceutical in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 18-mer partial phosphorothioate oligonucleotide sequence was synthesized and grafted in 5' with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15760">tyramine</z:chebi> group which was further radioiodinated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radioiodination of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15760">tyramine</z:chebi> derivatized oligonucleotides was performed using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53767">chloramine T</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(1) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> CD-1 mice were injected via a tail vein with 148 kBq (125)I-FR-ASON (2-3 microg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed at the end of 1, 2, 4 and 24 h, and tissue samples were studied.(2) Liposome-mediated 3.33 MBq (131)I-FR-ASON (7-9 microg) were injected intratumorally into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing BALB/c mice (6 weeks after inoculation of 107 Namalwa cells) meanwhile liposome-mediated (131)I labeled sense oligonucleotides served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biodistribution was monitored by sequential scintigraphy and organ radioactivity measurement 24 h after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Percentage of the injected dose per gram of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>/non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue ratios (T/NT) were calculated for each group of mice and the difference between two groups was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5' <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15760">tyramine</z:chebi> group allowed specific and stable radiolabeling of the ASON with radioiodine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The radioactivity reached its peak 1 h after injection, and then decreased rapidly in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice after intravenous administration of (125)I-FR-ASON </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The liver, stomach and intestine played an important role in biodistribution and radioactivity counts were low in bone, brain and blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When (131)I-FR-ASON was injected intratumorally into mice grafted with Namalwa cell line, images showed the tracer accumulated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immediately after intratumoral administration, only the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was visible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Scintiscans performed at the end of 1 and 2 h showed elimination of the tracer from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> to the abdomen and at the end of 24 h the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was clearly seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Percentage of the injected dose per gram of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and T/NT ratios for the sense group (control) were significantly lower than those of the antisense group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Radiolabeled Ig FR ASON showed high specificity in V1 family B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which should be further investigated for nuclear medicine imaging application and radionuclide antisense therapy </plain></SENT>
