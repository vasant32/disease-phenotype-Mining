<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was generated against the C terminus of EBNA-1 and evaluated for the detection of EBNA-1 in different cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> recognized were mapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since sequence variations of EBNA-1 have been reported in nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) tissues and in infected healthy individuals, the ability of these MAbs to recognize a recombinant protein derived from an NPC biopsy was also analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAb 4H11 appeared to react with EBNA-1 sequences from different sources, whereas MAbs 5C11, 5F12 and 8F6 failed to recognize a recombinant EBNA-1 protein cloned from an NPC patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using different recombinant EBNA-1 fragments in an immunoblot format, this study demonstrates that the domain bounded by amino acids 408 and 498 is very immunogenic in mice in that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> in this region are recognized by various MAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Amino acid sequences of EBNA-1 were also deduced from nucleotide sequences amplified from three Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, two spontaneous lymphoblastoid cell lines, two NPC biopsies and one NPC hybrid cell line, NPC-KT, and compared to the sequence from B95-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amino acid sequence of EBNA-1 in Akata is almost identical to that in an NPC biopsy, except for amino acid 585 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate that the immunogenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of EBNA-1 are highly variable </plain></SENT>
