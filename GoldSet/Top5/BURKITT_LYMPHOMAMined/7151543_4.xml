<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although suitable for light microscopy, these chromosomes were too flat for a close examination of their fine structure by scanning electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The surface of Giemsa-positive regions was rough and bright, whereas that of unstained or poorly stained regions was smoother and less bright </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Giemsa-staining, therefore, seems to produce the bulkiness of the chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On topographical examination by scanning electron microscopy, the transparent chromosomes as observed with the light microscope proved to be "footprints" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stereographical examinations of surface-spread chromosomes showed that minimally stretched chromosomes were composed of a mass of nodular and twisted looping fibers with an average diameter of about 300 A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The substructure of these chromosome fibers was not determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The kinetochore region was discernible as a constriction in the mass of the chromosome fibers, and was distinguishable from gaps by the presence of several chromosome fibers parallel to the axis of the chromatid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The organization of the chromosome fibers, however, was disordered rather than regular </plain></SENT>
