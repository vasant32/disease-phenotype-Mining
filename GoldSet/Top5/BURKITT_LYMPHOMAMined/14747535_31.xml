<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As well as blocking B-cell signal transduction, LMP2A has been shown to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathway, which acts as a survival signal in both B cells and epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is a multifunctional cytokine that plays important roles in regulating cell growth and differentiation in many biological systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The loss of the growth-inhibitory response to the TGF-beta 1 signal is found in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and is widely thought to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that LMP2A induced the phosphorylation of Akt (serine 473) in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Ramos and in gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>-39 and partially enhanced cell viability following TGF-beta 1 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, LMP2A partially inhibited TGF-beta 1-induced DNA fragmentation and cleavage of poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the presence of LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3-K, the LMP2A-mediated inhibitory effects on TGF-beta 1-induced DNA fragmentation and cleavage of PARP were alleviated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, LMP2A did not alter the levels of expression of type I and type II TGF-beta 1 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that LMP2A may inhibit TGF-beta 1-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through activation of the PI3-K/Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
