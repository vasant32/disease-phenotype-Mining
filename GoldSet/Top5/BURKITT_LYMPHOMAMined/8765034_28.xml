<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the few exceptional cases where TAP-independent presentation of an endogenously expressed protein has been observed, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>-containing domain of the protein either has naturally accessed or has been directed into the ER lumen where it is thought to become susceptible to ER proteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a novel example of TAP-independent processing involving the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein LMP2, a multiple membrane-spanning protein with minimal projection into the ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of LMP2 in the TAP-T2 cell line, whether from the resident EBV genome or from a recombinant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042214" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vaccinia</z:e> virus vector vacc-LMP2, rendered the cells sensitive to recognition by CTL clones specific for two HLA-A2.1-restricted <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi>, LMP2 329-337 or 426-434 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vacc-LMP2-mediated sensitization to lysis required expression of the antigen de novo in T2 cells and was blocked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48080">brefeldin A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the same experiments, two other EBV-specific CTL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi>, one derived from LMP2 but restricted through a different HLA allele (A11), the other restricted through A2.1 but derived from a different <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein (BMLF1), did not display TAP-independent processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results are discussed in relation to the unusual topology of LMP2 in the membrane and the position of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> within that structure </plain></SENT>
