<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A mouse monoclonal antibody, WI-MN-1, was raised against G-361 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reactivity of this antibody was characterized by indirect immunofluorescence against 22 cell lines and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Positive reactions were seen against three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> cell lines (G-361, HT-144, and MeWo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It also reacted against an epidermoid <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line (Hep-2) and amnion cells (WISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antibody failed to react against cell lines derived from granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the lung, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the cervix, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the colon, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the breast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo>, and a human monocytoid cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> and mouse fibroblast cell lines were also nonreactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was no reaction against human peripheral blood, bone marrow, spleen, lymph node, thymus, breast, lung, stomach, heart, brain, kidney, liver, skin, or testis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The antibody was also tested by indirect immunofluorescence against 17 samples of metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>malignant melanoma</z:hpo> which were removed from 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>WI-MN-1 gave positive reaction against 16 of these specimens, and it reacted with the cryostat section in the immunoperoxidase test, delineating neoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The antibody precipitated Mr 105,000 and 38,000 antigens from biosynthetically labeled G-361 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that WI-MN-1 was a useful addition to the panel of monoclonal antibodies against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>-associated antigens </plain></SENT>
