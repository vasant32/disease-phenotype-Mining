<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their cytological types have been confirmed by numerous immunological studies as B- and T-cell types and have been related to clinico-pathological entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this presentation, the cytological types of the two classifications are compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 13 major types of the Lukes-Collins classification are essentially identical with the Kiel counterparts, though the terminology differs in four of the 11 types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the two types in which discordance occurs, the relationship between the types of the two classifications are clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, the two classifications are placed into effective alignment for understanding and translating terminological differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both classifications represent sound bases for morphological diagnoses and also for relating the results of the broad range of current and future immunological studies to <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
