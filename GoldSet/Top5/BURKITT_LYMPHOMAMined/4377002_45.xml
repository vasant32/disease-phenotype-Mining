<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The abnormality was readily detected in 7 out of 7 Burkitt lines, and when present could be seen in 100% of cells with recognizable No. 14 chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the abnormality was not observed in 775 cells from 31 infectious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mononucleosis</z:e>-derived lines nor in 450 cells from 18 lines obtained from cord blood lymphocytes experimentally transformed by EB virus in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The significance of the abnormality as an indication of cells transformed by the virus in vivo is discussed, and the importance of this considered in relation to a possible oncogenic role for EB virus in man </plain></SENT>
