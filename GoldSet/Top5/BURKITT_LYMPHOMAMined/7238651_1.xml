<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were compared to neutrophils with respect to their cytotoxic activity against IgG-sensitized erythrocytes (ox; ORBC) and nucleated (Raji) target cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overall, neutrophils were more efficient than lymphocytes in lysing erythrocytes, but lymphocytes were more efficient in lysing Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibody concentrations producing maximal levels of lysis against erythrocyte target cells were similar for both kinds of effector cells and guinea pig complement; however, in order to obtain Raji cell lysis mediated by neutrophils at a level comparable to that produced by lymphocytes a higher concentration of antibody was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another difference found between the lytic activity of these effector cell populations was kinetics of lysis against erythrocyte target: a 15 min lag phase was consistently observed only with neutrophil effector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both effector cells lyse Raji cells with similar kinetics and no lag phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lysis by lymphocytes and neutrophils was directly proportional to the effector:target cell (E:T) ratio against both target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effector cells were similarly inhibited from lysis of erythrocytes by IgG aggregate, but neutrophil lysis of Raji cells appeared to be more sensitive to inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neutrophils did not lyse nonsensitized bystander cells, and lymphocytes lysed sheep erythrocyte bystander cells only </plain></SENT>
