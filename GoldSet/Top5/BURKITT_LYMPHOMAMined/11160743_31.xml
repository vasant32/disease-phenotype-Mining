<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, caspase activation is not required for induction of the lytic cycle since the latter is not blocked by the caspase inhibitor ZVAD </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although it is closely associated with the lytic cycle, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is neither necessary nor sufficient for its activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiparameter FACS analysis of cultures treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>, anti-Ig, or TGF-beta revealed BZLF1-expressing cells distributed in different phases of the cell cycle according to which inducer was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, BZLF1-positive cells did not appear to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and accumulate with a sub-G1 DNA content, irrespective of the inducer used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This result, which suggests that lytic gene expression is protective, was confirmed and extended by immunofluorescence staining doubled with TUNEL analysis </plain></SENT>
