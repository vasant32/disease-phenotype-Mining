<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of multiple point mutations in rearranged Ig V genes and their immediate flanking sequences suggests that the DNA repair system may not be working properly in correcting point mutations introduced to the restricted region of Ig genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the DNA repair functions of germinal center (GC) centroblasts, which are the cells in which ongoing Ig hypermutation takes place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that GC centroblasts express <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known components of the human DNA mismatch repair system, and that the system corrects DNA mismatches in a strand-specific manner in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that general suppression of mismatch repair at the cellular level does not occur during somatic hypermutation </plain></SENT>
