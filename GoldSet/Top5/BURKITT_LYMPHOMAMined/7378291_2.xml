<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two isozymes (A and C) were common for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lines, whereas different forms of a third isozyme with intermediate electrophoretic mobility (B) appeared in nine lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isozyme A seemed to be associated with cell proliferation and was not a marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The appearance of different B isozymes not present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood lymphocytes, occurred in some Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines and in two non-malignant lines maintained for a long time in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three lines derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> a variant of isozyme B seemed to be a marker for cell origin </plain></SENT>
