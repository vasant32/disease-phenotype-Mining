<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a new, nonrandom t(2;16)(p11.2;p11.2) in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three of 292 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> studied at Indiana University Medical Center had this translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three had additional chromosomal abnormalities at diagnosis and were classified as having low hyperdiploidy (47-49 chromosomes) with structural abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients, two boys and one girl, ranged in age from 3 to 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peripheral white blood cells (WBC) counts ranged from 1.8 to 107.4 x 10(9)/L, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were classified as French-American-British (FAB) type L1, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had B-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients have relapsed after first remissions of 2 years 8 months to 6 years, the t(2;16) may indicate a poor prognosis and more aggressive treatment may be indicated for such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because this translocation was the sole abnormality in one clone of patient 2 at relapse, it may be considered the primary abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it may also be the primary abnormality in the other two patients, and the genes involved in the breakpoints may be important in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
