<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When 5 X 10(5) cord blood lymphocytes were seeded into the semisolid agar medium immediately after EBV exposure, 3-10 times more colonies developed in the presence of the plant extracts at their optimal doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When a smaller number of 5 X 10(4) cells were seeded, transformed colonies were also observed in the presence of the plant extracts but not in their absence </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no colonies detected in the EBV-uninfected cultures with the extracts, indicating that the virus was required for the promotion by these plant extracts of this lymphocyte transformation </plain></SENT>
