<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> (CHX), a potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48001">protein synthesis inhibitor</z:chebi>, induces high levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Epstein-Barr virus free (EBV(-)) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (BJA-B) cells, with comparably reduced levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the EBV positive (EBV(+)) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Modulation of CHX-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in EBV(-) and (+) B cells is reported here using concurrent treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12, 13-dibutyrate, PdBu) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells were collected at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after treatment with (i) 1 microgram/ml CHX, (ii) 0.1 microgram/ml PdBu (1 hour pretreatment before 0 h), or (iii) CHX + PdBu (CHX added at 0 h, 1 hour after PdBu) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control cultures were untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic, necrotic or viable cells were quantified using histological, ultrastructural and biochemical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein synthesis was assessed using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>-methionine incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracellular calcium concentrations were measured using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PdBu alone had little effect on cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>: High levels of CHX-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in EBV(-) cells were significantly reduced by concurrent addition of PdBu (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, low levels of CHX-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in EBV(+) cells were not significantly altered by PdBu treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In EBV(-) cells, a negative relationship was observed between levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and calcium concentrations, whereas in EBV(+) cells, there was negligible correlation between these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus high levels of CHX-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in EBV(-) cells occur via a PKC-dependent pathway, whereas CHX treatment of EBV(+) cells induces comparatively low levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> that occur via a PKC-independent mechanism </plain></SENT>
