<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High performance liquid chromatography profiles of the bases released by these extracts showed that the activity was specific for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38635">3-methyladenine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was little variation in the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38635">3-methyladenine</z:chebi>-DNA glycosylase between the different cell lines despite a 40-fold difference in sensitivity to temozolomide and no correlation with the level of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase </plain></SENT>
