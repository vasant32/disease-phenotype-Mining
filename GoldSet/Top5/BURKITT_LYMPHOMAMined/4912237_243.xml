<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A subline of the P3 (Jijoye) Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, designated P3HR-1, initially contained 1 to 5% of cells which were positive by indirect immunofluorescence with selected human sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 4 months of propagation, this cell line regularly showed 15 to 40% reactive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antigen(s) in the cell line which was reactive by immunofluorescence was similar or identical to that found in several other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> cell lines in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the cells were incubated at 35 or 32 C for 9 to 15 days without refeeding, more than 50% of the cells became immunofluorescence-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen different cultures of P3HR-1 cells, which contained up to 75% immunofluorescence-positive cells, were thin-sectioned and examined by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of cells containing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e>-type virus particles in the cultures varied from &lt;3 to 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was generally a good correlation between the number of immunofluorescent cells and the number of cells containing virus particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of virus particles per cell section ranged from 1 to more than 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results strongly support the hypothesis that the immunofluorescent antigen is related to the presence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e>-type virus particle in the cells </plain></SENT>
