<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A two-dimensional immunoblot analysis of chemically induced EBV DNA carrying Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines shows besides a large number of minor components at least two major groups of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi>: the most prominent group of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> is observed in the range of 48 to 58 kDa (pI 4.5 to 8.5) and another group at 38/36 kDa (pI 4.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> complex (p52) belonging to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced early antigen complex (EA) has been isolated from IdU-induced Raji and B95-8 cells as well as from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi>-induced P3HR-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The p52 <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> have been purified by chromatography on Blue-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi>-, CM-, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">Phenyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purification of these components of the EA complex was monitored by ELISA and by two-dimensional immunoblots using a well-characterized high anti-EBV positive human serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The isolated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> have an apparent mol wt of about 52,000 Da as determined under nondenaturing conditions by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One- and two-dimensional immunoblots show a major group of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> of 52 kDa (pI 8.5 to 5.5) with EA activity and some minor components with smaller size up to 40 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter seem to be generated by limited proteolysis of p52 <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EA activity of the isolated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> could be confirmed by their reaction with IgG anti-EA positive as well as IgA anti-EA positive sera by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The purified <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> complex did not react with anti-EA-D negative, anti-EA-R positive sera obtained from patients with African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, suggesting that these <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> belong to the EA-D complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal antibody R3 reacted with the isolated 52 kDa components of EA suggesting a common <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> present on these <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi>, the same result was obtained with three rabbit sera produced against the isolated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> complex </plain></SENT>
