<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the relationship between cell cycle and EBV receptor (EBVR) expression on single cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBVR was present throughout the entire cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The level of expression, however, varied; increasing in G1 and G2/M while remaining approximately constant in S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of receptor density in terms of cell size demonstrated that smaller cells, in early G1, have a greater density of receptors per unit membrane than larger G2/M and S phase cells </plain></SENT>
