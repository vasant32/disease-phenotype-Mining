<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The P32/Ishida cells were proved to have immature B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotypes</z:mp> on the basis of immunological surface marker analysis: surface immunoglobulins (gamma, mu, kappa), Ia-like antigen, B1 antigen, and common <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> antigen were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A small amount of IgM, but no IgG, could be detected in both cell extract and culture supernate of P32/Ishida cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies revealed that the P32/Ishida cells consisted of cells having three derivative karyotypes characterized by common marker chromosomes, dup(1), and 14q + due to a new variant chromosomal translocation (2;14), which has not been identified in usual Burkitt's cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity were confirmed to be negative </plain></SENT>
