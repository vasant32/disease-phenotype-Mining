<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Ramos cells, induction of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for the intermediate isoform of 2-5A synthetase (p69) requires five-fold higher IFN-alpha than is required for induction of the small isoform (p40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The p40 and p69 isoforms are similarly induced between 1 and 24 h with maximal induction at 8 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 48 h, however, p69 is more strongly induced than p40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Induction of p69 and p40 between 1 and 24 h is protein synthesis independent whereas at 48 h, p69 induction becomes dependent on protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial induction of both isoforms requires tyrosine kinase activation and is enhanced by activation of a separate signalling pathway by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> promoter, 12-0-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45127">phorbol-13-acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that induction of the p40 is predominantly protein synthesis independent, whereas p69 induction occurs in two phases, an initial protein synthesis independent phase and a delayed protein synthesis dependent phase </plain></SENT>
