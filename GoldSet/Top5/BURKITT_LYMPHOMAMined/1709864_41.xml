<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that a neutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> (globotriosylceramide; Gb3) was specifically expressed on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and on a subset of germinal center tonsillar B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently the Gb3 molecule was recognized as a new B cell differentiation antigen and now defines the CD77 cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report an extensive phenotypic and functional characterization of the tonsillar CD77+ B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cells have a low buoyant density and are thus purified using a Percoll gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They express various B cell antigens such as CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22 and CD40, as well as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules LFA-1, LFA-3 and CD44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They are positive for surface IgM and negative for surface IgD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although these results suggest a phenotype of activated B cells, the CD77+ cells are negative for the classical activation antigens: CD23 (the low-affinity Fc receptor for IgE), CD25 [the interleukin (IL) 2 receptor alpha chain] and CD71 (the transferrin receptor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proliferation and protein synthesis of CD77+ cells was measured after stimulation with a range of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> and IL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the agents tested are able to induce proliferation and protein synthesis with the exception of a combination of recombinant IL 4 plus anti-CD40 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When examined by electron microscopy, CD77+ B lymphocytes present a <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> similar to that of cells undergoing programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, also called <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (i.e. chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, membrane blebbing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As shown by direct examination of DNA, these CD77+ cells are indeed in the process of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the CD77+ cells by recombinant IL 4 and anti-CD40 antibody prevents <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these results suggest that the CD77 molecule defines a B lymphocyte maturation pathway, specific for germinal center, where the cells undergo programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
