<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells characteristic chromosomal translocations juxtapose the MYC oncogene to one of the three immunoglobulin (IG) gene loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This results in deregulation of MYC expression through IG gene enhancer elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As enhancers and MYC promoters can be as much as several hundred kilobases apart, long-distance effects are to be postulated, which affect chromatin organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since transcriptionally active and inactive sequences can be distinguished based on their localization in nuclear halo preparations, we used this technique to assess the topology of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and translocated MYC and IGK genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following visualization of these genes by fluorescence in situ hybridization, the signal distribution was determined in nuclear halo structures of human monocytes and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-derived cell line LY66 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MYC signals derived from the non-translocated chromosome 8 were found equally distributed between the residual nucleus and the surrounding DNA halo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the activated MYC and IGK genes on the translocated chromosome in LY66 cells were associated with the residual nucleus in 78 and 88% of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In LY66 cells, attachment to the residual nucleus was restricted to a DNA segment 30 to 50 kb downstream of MYC, while in monocytes it was dispersed over 80 kb around the MYC gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate a specific chromatin organization for the activated MYC locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Distance measurements between MYC and IGK signals revealed shorter values than expected from their linear distance (325 kb), indicating a back folding of the DNA backbone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is strong evidence for a specific topological organization, which is functionally related to the MYC activation status with the specific folding of the DNA strand likely reflecting maintenance of a spatial interaction between IGK enhancer and MYC promoter elements </plain></SENT>
