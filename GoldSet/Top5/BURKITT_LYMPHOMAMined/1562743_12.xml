<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since any type of immunosuppressive treatment is known to carry the risk of developing B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, we investigated the in vitro effect of ALG on human B-cell activation and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data demonstrate that whatever the source of lymphocytes used for ALG preparation (thymocytes, thoracic duct lymphocytes, B- or T-cell lines), (1) ALG react with both B- and T-cell lines, and (2) ALG contain antibodies specific for B cells (eg, CD21) or common to T and B cells (eg anti-beta 2-microglobulin, anti-HLA-DR, CD18, CD11a) in addition to T-cell-specific antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other T-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> tested (Concanavalin A [Con A], Pokeweek <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> [PWM], CD3 and CD2 antibodies), ALG do not trigger B-cell differentiation into immunoglobulin-secreting cells at concentrations which induce maximum T-cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This effect could be attributed to a direct interaction of ALG with B lymphocytes as shown by the capacity of ALG to block the response of purified B cells to a variety of activators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the ALG tested were shown to inhibit the proliferation of six of the seven Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and six of the seven Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This selective B-cell antiproliferative property of ALG was not reproduced with CD11a, CD18, CD21, CD24, or anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that, although suppressing T-cell responses, ALG treatment may directly control B cell proliferation to some extent, in keeping with the relatively low risk of posttransplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> reported with ALG </plain></SENT>
