<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed paraffin sections from 32 children with histologically confirmed Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) for the presence of EBV using in situ hybridization to detect expression of the EBV-encoded early <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (EBERs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV was present in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of 11 patients (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty nine percent of the children presented with abdominal disease, 19% had bone marrow infiltration and only one child had jaw involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between EBV positive and EBV negative children with regard to age, gender, origin, primary site at presentation, or clinical stage of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was a trend for younger age in the children with EBV positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> with a median age of 4, compared to 7 years in children with EBV negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the 7 children of Ashkenazi Jewish origin had EBER positive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the treatment outcome between the EBV positive patients (estimated survival at 24 months of 82%) and EBV negative children (estimated survival rate of 71% (p=0.58)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although this is only a small series it seems that childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in Israel has the clinical characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, non-African type with 34% EBV association and a low incidence of jaw <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that Ashkenazi Jewish children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> are less likely to have EBV positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> than other ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, more patients will need to be studied in order to assess the validity of this observation </plain></SENT>
