<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aptamers were selected using a cell-based SELEX strategy in our laboratory for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells that, when utilized in this method, allow for the selective recognition of the cells from complex mixtures including fetal bovine serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aptamer-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles were used for the selective targeting cell extraction, and aptamer-conjugated fluorescent nanoparticles were employed for sensitive cellular detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Employing both types of nanoparticles allows for selective and sensitive detection not possible by using the particles separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent nanoparticles amplify the signal intensity versus a single fluorophore label resulting in improved sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, aptamer-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles allow for extraction and enrichment of target cells not possible with other separation methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent imaging and a microplate reader were used for cellular detection to demonstrate the wide applicability of this methodology for medical diagnostics and cell enrichment and separation </plain></SENT>
