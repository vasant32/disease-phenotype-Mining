<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antiviral capsid antigen tests gave positive results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, siblings, and control neighbors; but the geometric mean antibody titers to <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen were significantly higher in patients than in siblings or neighbors (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No control neighbors or siblings had antibodies to restricted (EA-R) or diffuse (EA-D) early antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean geometric anti-EA-R titers at admssion and at last visit were significantly lower in patients with stage (I and II) than in those with stage (III and IV) disease; this most likely reflected the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who relapsed after 1 year of sustained remission had significantly higher anti-EA-R titers than did those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in the probability of relapse was sixfold for those patients with an anti-EA-R titer of greater than 160 after 1 year of sustained remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survivors and nonsurvivors differed significantly in the final EA-R and Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) titers (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-EA-D titers were particularly likely to be positive in patients with multiple relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When skin reactivity to an antigen from RAJI cells was compared to EBV-related serologic reactions in the same patient, a significant inverse correlation (P less than 0.001) between skin reactivity and EBNA titers appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment sera from patients with high EBNA titers did not block skin reactivity to the RAJI antigen </plain></SENT>
