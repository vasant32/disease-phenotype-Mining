<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We established and characterized a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL-L3 according to FAB classification, or Burkitt's type) cell line, KHM-10B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the patient's lymphoblasts and KHM-10B cells corresponded to that of ALL-L3 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells were positive for HLA-DR, CD19 and surface immunoglobulin (mu, lambda) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis revealed that the fresh lymphoblasts and KHM-10B shared the same immunoglobulin gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetic analysis of fresh lymphoblasts from the patient and KHM-10B cells revealed the 13q34 abnormality, the second most common additional abnormality in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but no detectable 8q24 involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement of the c-myc oncogene was not detected by Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay identified a t(8;22)(q24;q11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The KHM-10B cells were arrested at S phase with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi>, and the synchronized cells progressed through the cell cycle in drug-free medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of c-myc and max was observed throughout the cell cycle, as was found in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell in Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that FISH analysis is of diagnostic value in detecting obscure chromosomal translocations and that max, as well as c-myc, is expressed constitutively in ALL-L3 and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
