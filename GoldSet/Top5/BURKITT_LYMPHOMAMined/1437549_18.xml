<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi> gene encodes a protein with putative zinc finger domains and was involved in the activation of the ret proto-oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further characterize the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi> protein, we developed a polyclonal antibody against the product synthesized from a fragment of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi> cDNA expressed in Escherichia coli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi> was identified as a 58 kDa protein in cell lysates from four human and rodent cell lines and from mouse testis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, a unique 68 kDa protein was detected in the testis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using AH7974 (rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e>) and Raji (human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) cells, we demonstrated strong association of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi> with the nuclear matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi> solubilized from the nuclear matrix had DNA-binding activity although it appears to bind more preferentially to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> than to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results thus suggest that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi> may play a role in molecular processes which occur in the nuclear matrix </plain></SENT>
