<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> B-cell lines studied were found to be constitutive producers of a growth activity which assisted the S-phase entry of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activated B-cells and provided growth support for lymphoblastoid cells transformed by Epstein-Barr virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lines responded by enhanced proliferation to supernatants from a BCGF-producing T-cell hybridoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lines, however, displayed autostimulation to their own supernatants and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> B-cell line appeared totally dependent on soluble factors for its growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Non-tumorigenic B-cell lines, by contrast, revealed a strict dependency on homologous growth factor for their continued proliferation in suspension culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings support a progression model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> based upon the utilization, production and, ultimately, emancipation from growth-promoting soluble factors </plain></SENT>
