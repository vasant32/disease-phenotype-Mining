<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>D-HIT, transcribed from a GC-rich repetitive region (IR4) of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome, is highly structured, responding to RNase digestion in a manner akin to double-stranded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing EBV-carrying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines with differing responses to IFN-alpha, we found the protein levels of the dsRNA-activated kinase, PKR, to be similar, whereas the levels of the autophosphorylated active form of PKR varied in a manner that correlated with endogenous levels of D-HIT expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a classical in vitro kinase assay, addition of either poly(I)-poly(C) or an in vitro-transcribed D-HIT homolog stimulated the autophosphorylation activity of PKR from IFN-alpha-treated cells in both EBV-positive and EBV-negative B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By transfection experiments, these <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> were shown to reduce cell proliferation and to sensitize otherwise relatively insensitive Raji cells to IFN-alpha </plain></SENT>
