<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated serum Ca 125 levels in 44 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 59 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at initial presentation and 4 weeks after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum Ca 125 levels were measured chemilumimetrically with a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of elevated serum Ca 125 levels was significantly higher in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (14 children) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (26 children) than in the healthy children (2 children) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) who had abdominal involvement and/or serous membrane involvement (ascides, pleural, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo>) at presentation, serum Ca 125 levels were significantly higher than in the patients without abdominal and/or serosal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum Ca 125 levels were impressively increased in the patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) in whom abdominal and/or serous membrane involvement were observed more frequently than the other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased serum Ca 125 levels in the patients returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 4 weeks after chemotherapy when they achieved complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, serum Ca 125 seems to be a good indicator for serous membrane involvement and it seems to be a promising <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker in the assessment of therapeutic response in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and NHL </plain></SENT>
