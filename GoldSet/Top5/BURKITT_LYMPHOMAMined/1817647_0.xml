<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the basic technology of cell culture conditions for production of useful substances such as cytokines, and related proteins produced by Namalwa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Namalwa cells, human B lymphoblastoid cells, were used for large scale production of alpha-interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Namalwa KJM-1, a subline of Namalwa cells, adapted to serum- and albumin-free medium, can grow at a high density above 1 x 10(7) cells/ml in suspension manner by the use of a perfusion culture system, Biofermenter, containing a cone-type cell-sedimentation column as cell separator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several kinds of cytokine cDNA can be introduced and expressed in Namalwa KJM-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of these were produced in large quantities by use of a gene amplification method with dhfr, even through the Namalwa KJM-1 cells contained endogenous dhfr genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For stable production of the target protein, Namalwa KJM-1 cells are very useful host cells, because they have no effective endogenous protease activity in the conditioned medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using Biofermenter with micro-<z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> fibers and a dialysis system, the specific productivity of the target proteins was not depressed at a high cell density </plain></SENT>
