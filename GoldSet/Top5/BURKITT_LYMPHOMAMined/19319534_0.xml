<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> possessing large <z:mp ids='MP_0003327'>liver cysts</z:mp>, up to the size of 7 x 7 cm, wherein clearance of high-dose MTX was severely delayed, despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal and liver functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The serum MTX concentration was higher than 0.1 microM on day 12 and remained at toxic levels, higher than 0.01 microM, even on day 25, resulting in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was presumed that MTX accumulated in the <z:mp ids='MP_0003327'>liver cysts</z:mp> over time and was slowly released back into the serum, resulting into prolonged high serum MTX concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High dose of MTX in patients with large <z:mp ids='MP_0003327'>liver cysts</z:mp> induces severe toxicity by virtue of MTX accumulation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> and its subsequent delayed clearance </plain></SENT>
