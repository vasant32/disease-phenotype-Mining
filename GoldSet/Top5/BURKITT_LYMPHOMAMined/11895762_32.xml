<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed detailed molecular studies in 96 childhood precursor-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> at diagnosis and at relapse (n = 91) or at presumably secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clonal Ig and TCR targets for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> detection were identified in 94 patients, with 71% of these targets being preserved at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The best stability was found for IGK-Kde rearrangements (90%), followed by TCRG (75%), IGH (64%), and incomplete TCRD rearrangements (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combined Southern blot and PCR data for IGH, IGK-Kde, and TCRD genes showed significant differences in stability at relapse between monoclonal and oligoclonal rearrangements: 89% versus 40%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 38% of patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>-PCR targets were preserved at relapse, and in 40% most of the targets (&gt; or = 50%) were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 22% of patients most targets (10 cases) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> targets (10 cases) were lost at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter 10 cases included 4 patients with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> with germline Ig/TCR genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 5 other patients additional analyses proved the clonal relationship between both disease stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, in 1 patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Ig/TCR gene rearrangements were completely different between diagnosis and relapse, which is suggestive of secondary ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on the presented data, we propose stepwise strategies for selection of stable PCR targets for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> monitoring, which should enable successful detection of relapse in most (95%) of childhood precursor-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
