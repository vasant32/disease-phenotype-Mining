<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Syndecan-1 is a cell surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> containing a highly conserved transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain, and an extracellular domain bearing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through these domains, syndecan-1 is proposed to have roles in growth factor action, extracellular matrix <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, and cytoskeletal organization that controls cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the role of syndecan-1 in cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and cytoskeleton reorganization, mouse syndecan-1 cDNA was transfected into human Raji cells, a lymphoblastoid cell line that grows as suspended cells and exhibits little or no endogenous cell surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High expressing transfectants (Raji-Sl cells) bind to and spread on immobilized thrombospondin or fibronectin, which are ligands for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> chains of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This binding and spreading as not dependent on the cytoplasmic domain of the core protein, is mutants expressing core proteins with cytoplasmic deletions maintain the ability to spread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The spreading is mediated through engagement of the syndecan-1 core protein, as the Raji-S 1 cells also bind to and spread on immobilized mAb 281.2, an antibody specific for the ectodomain of the syndecan-1 core protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spreading on the antibody is independent of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> chains and can be inhibited by competition with soluble mAb 281.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spreading can be inhibited by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">cytochalasin</z:chebi> D or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the core protein of syndecan-1 mediates spreading through the formation of a multimolecular signaling complex at the cell surface that signals cytoskeleton reorganization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This complex may form via intramembrane or extracellular interactions with the syndecan core protein </plain></SENT>
