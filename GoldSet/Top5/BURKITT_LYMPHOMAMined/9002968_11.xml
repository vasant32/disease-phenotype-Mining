<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the geographic differences in EBV expression in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), and the lack of studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> NHL from developing countries, we decided to survey the presence of EBV in a series of primary intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from patients in Mexico and in Western Europe, and to analyze whether EBV status is influenced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> phenotype, and geographic or ethnic determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Paraffin-embedded tissue from 43 primary intestinal NHLs (19 cases from Mexico and 24 from Western Europe) were examined, including 17 high grade B-NHLs, 9 low grade B-NHLs, and 17 T-NHLs; 6 of which were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002242'>enteropathy</z:hpo> associated T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of histologic subtypes was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of EBV was investigated with a combined approach using a nested polymerase chain reaction technique as well as immunohistochemistry for latent membrane protein-1 and in situ hybridization for EBV early <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcripts (EBER 1/2) <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age of the Mexican patients was significantly lower than the median age of the European patients (32 v 62 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This difference was most pronounced in patients with T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (24 v 63 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBER-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were detected in 13 of the 43 (30%) cases of primary intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including 5 of 26 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> B-NHL (3 high grade and 2 low grade), and 8 of 17 T-NHL, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were classified as pleomorphic, medium and large cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rates of EBV-positivity were markedly different for European and Mexican cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whereas 7 of 7 (100%) T-NHL and 5 of 12 (42%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> B-NHL of Mexican origin were EBER-positive, only 1 of 10 T-NHL and 0 of 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> B-NHL from Europe showed EBER expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Latent membrane protein was positive in only 2 of 43 cases, 1 of which was an EBER-negative high grade B-NHL from Mexico that showed intact total <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in control hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CD30 expression was found in 4 of 8 EBV-positive T-NHL and in none of the EBV-positive B-NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast to European cases, intestinal NHLs from Mexico show a very high frequency of EBV-positivity, which is not limited to T-NHL, but includes a significant proportion of B-NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study strongly suggests that similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and probably <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, there are important epidemiologic differences in EBV association in intestinal T-cell NHL between European and Mexican populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These differences might be the result of environmental factors, for example, earlier contact with childhood viruses on intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
