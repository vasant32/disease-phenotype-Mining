<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on the Oriental populations are very limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the current study was performed on the Chinese population of Hong Kong, where the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> is low and EBV seroconversion occurs early in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three consecutive samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> collected from 18 male and five female patients over a 12-year period were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first age peak occurred in the second decade of life, and the second peak in the seventh decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the sensitive and specific EBV-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (EBERs) in situ localization technique, positive labeling of the Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants was detected in five of five samples (100%) of mixed cellularity, nine of 16 samples (56%) of nodular sclerosing, one of one sample (100%) of lymphocyte depleted, and none of one sample (0%) of nodular lymphocyte predominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of the data by age group yielded the following results: four of five (80%) for age younger than 15 years, three of nine (33%) for age 15 to 49, and eight of nine (89%) for age 50 or higher, confirming the reported strong association of EBV with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> at the extremes of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall positivity rate was 65%, which was intermediate between that reported in the Western populations and that in the Third World countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings can be explained by the epidemiological pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> in Hong Kong, in which the first age peak is left-shifted to a younger age compared with that of Western populations (but not as early as that observed in Third World countries), moving the peak toward an age bracket in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> shows stronger association with EBV </plain></SENT>
