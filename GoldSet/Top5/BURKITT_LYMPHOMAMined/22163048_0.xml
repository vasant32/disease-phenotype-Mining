<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The virus infects and immortalizes B cells establishing a persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> characterized by varying patterns of EBV latent gene expression (latency 0, I, II and III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CDK1 activator, Response Gene to Complement-32 (RGC-32, C13ORF15), is overexpressed in colon, breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> tissues and we have detected selective high-level RGC-32 protein expression in EBV-immortalized latency III cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significantly, we show that overexpression of RGC-32 in B cells is sufficient to disrupt G2 cell-cycle arrest consistent with activation of CDK1, implicating RGC-32 in the EBV transformation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, RGC-32 mRNA is expressed at high levels in latency I Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells and in some EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell-lines, although RGC-32 protein expression is not detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that RGC-32 mRNA expression is elevated in latency I cells due to transcriptional activation by high levels of the differentially expressed RUNX1c transcription factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that proteosomal degradation or blocked cytoplasmic export of the RGC-32 message were not responsible for the lack of RGC-32 protein expression in latency I cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly, analysis of the ribosomal association of the RGC-32 mRNA in latency I and latency III cells revealed that RGC-32 transcripts were associated with multiple ribosomes in both cell-types implicating post-initiation translational repression mechanisms in the block to RGC-32 protein production in latency I cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, our results are the first to demonstrate RGC-32 protein upregulation in cells transformed by a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> virus and to identify post-initiation translational mechanisms as an expression control point for this key cell-cycle regulator </plain></SENT>
