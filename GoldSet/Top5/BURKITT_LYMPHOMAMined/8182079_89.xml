<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our efforts to identify glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of those ligands, we achieved expression cloning of a novel human alpha 1,3-fucosyltransferase termed Fuc-TVII from a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cDNA library by enrichment of the Namalwa cells highly expressing that determinant with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of the COOH-terminal catalytic domain of Fuc-TVII showed an alpha 1,3-fucosyltransferase activity for a type II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> with a terminal alpha 2,3-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> among various acceptors, consistent with that in vivo acceptor specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alignment of the primary sequences of five alpha 1,3-fucosyltransferases and assignment of the chromosomal location of Fuc-TVII gene, together with that acceptor specificity, indicate that Fuc-TVII consists of a unique class of the alpha 1,3-fucosyltransferase family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Determination of the expression levels of these alpha 1,3-fucosyltransferases in various cells revealed that both Fuc-TVII and a myeloid fucosyltransferase Fuc-TIV were significantly expressed in myeloid lineage cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fuc-TVII-transfected Namalwa cells exhibited significant binding to E-selectin in contrast to little binding of the Fuc-TIV-transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Fuc-TVII may participate in the biosynthesis of the selectin ligands </plain></SENT>
