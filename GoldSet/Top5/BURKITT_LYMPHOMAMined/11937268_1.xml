<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blasts from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> patients with a hyperdiploid karyotype have a tendency to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> when cultured on stromal layers in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we apply a novel method to investigate the relationship between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and hyperdiploidy in lymphoblasts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The DNA content of individual ALL blasts in Feulgen-stained archival bone marrow smears can be determined by static cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TUNEL (TdT-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling) detects the DNA degradation associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed TUNEL in situ sequential to DNA ploidy analysis in archival bone marrow smears from 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients were diploid and seven were hyperdiploid (51-65 chromosomes) by conventional cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the five diploid cases, the percentage of TUNEL-positive blasts ranged from 1.0% to 1.3%; in the seven hyperdiploid cases, the percentage of TUNEL-positive blasts ranged from 3.6% to 9.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparing TUNEL and corresponding Feulgen images, we found that apoptotic blasts were predominantly of high DNA ploidy in both diploid and hyperdiploid cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean DNA value of apoptotic blasts was larger than that of the total blast population in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate an increased incidence of spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in situ of hyperdiploid blasts in ALL bone marrow and indicate that this phenomenon is not restricted to in vitro cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings provide a possible rationale for the good prognosis associated with hyperdiploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
