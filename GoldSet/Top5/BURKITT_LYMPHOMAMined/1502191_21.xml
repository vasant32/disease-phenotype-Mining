<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined the interaction of the microbial superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> corresponding to overlapping regions of the T-cell antigen receptor beta chain variable region V beta 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SEA is known to stimulate murine T cells bearing certain V beta elements, among them V beta 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were synthesized representing amino acids 1-24, 20-44, 39-60, 57-77, and 74-95 of V beta 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here that soluble V beta 3-bearing beta chains can bind to a complex of SEA and major histocompatibility complex class II and that the synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> V beta 3-(57-77) blocked this interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> V beta 3-(57-77) also inhibited SEA-induced interferon-gamma production and SEA-induced proliferation of B10.BR spleen cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> corresponding to amino acids 57-77 of V beta 8.2, a V beta element that is not recognized by SEA, decreased staphylococcal enterotoxin C-2-induced proliferation but did not affect SEA-induced proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> inhibition of SEA-induced function was due at least in part to inhibition of V beta 3-bearing T-cell activity, since the percentage of T cells reactive with an anti-V beta 3 monoclonal antibody was significantly reduced by V beta 3-(57-77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the region of V beta 3 encompassing amino acids 57-77 is an area that displays the appropriate sequence and conformation for binding of the SEA molecule and blocking of the resultant interaction with the T-cell antigen receptor </plain></SENT>
