<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the significance of this translocation in indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the case of a 75-year-old white male with left upper quadrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, and an elevated white cell count of 30.3x10(9) cells/L (84% large lymphoid cells with scanty cytoplasm and prominent central nucleoli) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotyping revealed a clonal B-cell population coexpressing CD5, CD19, and CD20 with weak CD23 and CD25 and very weak, restricted, surface lambda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cytogenetic analysis showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 cells with t(2;8)(p12;q24.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, four of the 20 cells also showed a second translocation: t(12;17)(p13;q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis using c-myc and p53 probes showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results with no indication of amplification of C-MYC or deletion of TP53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was managed as an indo-lent/low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> with excellent response to eight cycles of fludarabine </plain></SENT>
