<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we aimed to evaluate and compare the drug resistance in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) in association with their immunophenotypes and genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> and 14 patients with MM were classified according to prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard MoAb panel for ALL and triple labeled antibodies (CD38/CD56/CD19) and detection of intracellular light chains for MM were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51903">calcein</z:chebi> assay was performed for measure of P- <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1) and multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP-1) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Markers CD19, CD20 and HLA-DR proved to be useful in identifying cells of B-lymphoid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD34 progenitor cell antigen was present in high proportion of ALL blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both the abnormal plasmacell populations and their monoclonality in MM were confirmed by immunophenotyping, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> activity factor (MAF) values were not different in patients with MM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B- ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the mean MRP-1 values in MM were significantly lower than MAF-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1 (1.85+/-3.8 versus 5.92+/-7.45, p=0.05), but we have found lower values in refractory conditions as expected from previous studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotyping was helpful in detection of abnormal populations showing no correlation with the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in this study we could not confirm high <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> activity despite of the failure of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51903">calcein</z:chebi> assay seems to be useful for quantitative and sensitive measurement of the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The low activity of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>- 1 and MRP-1 in MM need further clarification, indicating the involvement of different transport in the resistance mechanism </plain></SENT>
