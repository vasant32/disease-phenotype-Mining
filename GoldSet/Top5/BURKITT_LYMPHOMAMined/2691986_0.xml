<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among several oligodeoxynucleotides, this protein bound to the fragments containing the sequence of 5'-CAPyCTCTNA-3' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Competition analysis revealed that the ARS binding protein could recognize not only the nucleotide sequences but also the high ordered structure </plain></SENT>
