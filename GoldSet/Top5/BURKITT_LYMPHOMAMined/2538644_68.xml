<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genes expressed in B lymphocytes immortalized in vitro or in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells infected in vivo have been characterized previously; however, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> products which are essential for immortalization or for establishment of EBV latency are still not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To approach this question, we compared the kinetics of expression of EBV nuclear antigens and the two EBV-encoded small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, EBER1 and EBER2, after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of primary B cells or EBV genome-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells with either an immortalizing EBV strain (B95-8) or the nonimmortalizing deletion mutant (HR-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of primary cells with B95-8 virus, EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA)-2 was expressed first, followed by EBNA-1, -3, and -4 (also called leader protein [LP]) and the two small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> of EBV genome-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells with the same strain of virus resulted in a similar pattern of gene expression, except that the EBNAs appeared together and more rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBERs were not apparent in one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line converted by B95-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only products detected after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of primary B lymphocytes with the HR-1 deletion mutant were the EBNA-4 (LP) family and trace amounts of EBER1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although HR-1 could express neither EBNA-1, EBNA-3, nor EBER2 in primary cells, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these products were expressed rapidly after HR-1 infection of EBV genome-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the mutation in HR-1 virus affects immortalization not only through failure to express EBNA-2, a gene which is deleted, but also indirectly by curtailing expression of several other EBV genes whose coding regions are intact in the HR-1 virus and normally expressed during latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of latent EBV gene expression after HR-1 infection is dependent on the host cell, perhaps through products specific for the cell cycle or the state of B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
