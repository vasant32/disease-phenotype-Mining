<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pediatric head and neck lesions can be difficult to characterize on clinical grounds alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the use of dynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> digital subtraction angiography as a noninvasive adjunct for the assessment of the vascularity of these abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients (age range, 2 days to 16 years) with known or suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Routine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, time-of-flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> digital subtraction angiography were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dynamic sequence was acquired in two planes at one frame per second by using a thick section (6-10 cm) selective radio-frequency spoiled fast gradient-echo sequence and an IV administered bolus of contrast material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The images were subtracted from a preliminary mask sequence and viewed as a video-inverted cine loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> digital subtraction angiography was successfully performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The technique showed the following: 1) slow flow lesions (two choroidal <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp>, eyelid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo>, and scalp venous malformation); 2) high flow lesions that were not always suspected by clinical examination alone (parotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo>, scalp, occipital, and eyelid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> plus a palatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo>); 3) a hypovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> for which a biopsy could be safely performed (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>); and 4) a hypervascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030215" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor of the palate</z:e> (cystic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our early experience suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> digital subtraction angiography can be reliably performed in children of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages without complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The technique provided a noninvasive assessment of the vascularity of each lesion that could not always have been predicted on the basis of clinical examination or routine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging alone </plain></SENT>
