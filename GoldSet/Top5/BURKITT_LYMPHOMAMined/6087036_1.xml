<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>False positive results were obtained in 15/15 tonsillectomy samples and in 9/27 specimens from children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> in remission, perhaps due to antihuman lymphocyte activity in the rabbit heteroantisera which are used in the indirect immunofluorescence technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon may be more pronounced in 'activated' <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such reactions are not due to antibodies directed against adenovirus, papovavirus or EB virus antigens, although these are common constitutents of human tonsillar cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional problems with TdT heteroantisera may result from immunization with non-TdT determinants in calf thymus extracts, as was manifest in human non-lymphoid (KB) cells cultured in fetal bovine serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These difficulties will be overcome only by production of a monoclonal antibody using human TdT as the antigen </plain></SENT>
