<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In childhood MNHL, drug response is variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At present the degree of presence of microsatellite variation, i.e., intrinsic DNA instability is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine presence and range of microsatellite variability in common childhood MNHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1.3.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Study Populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consecutive, unselected (1976-96) cases of childhood Large Cell diffuse, N = 16; (9T,7B), age range 1y5m-16y8m; Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo>, n = 13, age range 4y2m-14y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-malignant/pre-treatment tissue of 20 cases, 13 LC, 7 Burkitt's MNHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>1.3.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Molecular Pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Routine DNA extraction, amplifications at loci D3S 1304 and D3S1537 (both closely distal to VHL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor gene); ELN gene D7S1870; IFNA D1S243 (1p36) which show microsatellite variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Isotopic labelling in amplification, non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microsatellite variability was found 3/16 LC and 2/13 Burkitt's MNHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LC MNHL, 4 abnormal areas: n = 1, 3 abnormal areas: n = 1, 2 abnormal areas n = 1; Burkitt's MNHL, 3 abnormal areas: n = 1, 1 abnormal area n = 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No variability was found in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (constitutional) DNA of any of the 20 patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microsatellite variability occurred in 5/29 patients with common types of childhood MNHL, indicating a limited contribution to reduced drug resistance through this mechanism </plain></SENT>
