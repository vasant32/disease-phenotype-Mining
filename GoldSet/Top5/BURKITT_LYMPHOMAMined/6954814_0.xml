<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nuclear chromatin was coarsely clumped, and each nucleus contained multiple, prominent nucleoli </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preservation of nuclear detail obtainable in fixed wet imprints is emphasized, as is the use of these imprints as an aid in avoiding diagnostic pitfalls in the rapid diagnosis of a lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
