<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> EB-3 cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">gangliosides</z:chebi> GM1 or GM3 results in their binding to and partial incorporation into the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>About 25% of cell-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> GM1 can interact with the ricin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, such an increase in the number of binding sites does not enhance but rather decreases the cytotoxic effect of ricin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A similar protective effect was observed when the cells were pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> GM3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the increase in ricin biding sites caused by pretreatment of the cells with neuraminidase was accompanied by increase in ricin cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences may be related to observed differences in the rate of ricin-endocytosis by native and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi>-treated cells </plain></SENT>
