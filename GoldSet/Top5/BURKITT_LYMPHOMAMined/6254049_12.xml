<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such proteins could not be detected on the surface of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> resting human lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most prominent cytoskeletal protein identified on the surface membrane of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-transformed T and B lymphocytes was actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Epstein-Barr virus genome-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphoblastoid cell lines and in two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, the major iodinated membrane protein components were actin and alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-tubulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These proteins were firmly connected to the cytoplasmic skeleton and could not be removed by <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concurrent immunofluorescence studies with specific antibodies and F(ab')2 fragments confirmed the appearance of cytoskeletal components on the biochemical data, and indicated that such cytoskeletal proteins formed distinctive patterns on the cell surface, ranging from small patches to large projections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five-hour labeling with [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]methionine indicates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> such cells released large quantities of labeled actin and tubulins into the culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These materials were not readsorbed to the membrane surfaces of the cells </plain></SENT>
