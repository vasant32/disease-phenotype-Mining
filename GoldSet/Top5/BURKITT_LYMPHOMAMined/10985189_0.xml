<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The significant progress made in pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> during recent years has been due to a major breakthrough in the field of molecular biology and the introduction of new therapeutic strategies that take into account both the quality and the duration of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular biology has already been instrumental in more fully categorizing the 'small round-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>' group, and in reclassifying the 'Ewing family' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It also provides a valuable tool for the prognostic evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastomas</z:hpo> through the analysis of the N-myc oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, it has permitted the identification of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="LFS">Li-Fraumeni syndrome</z:e> of predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the child, thereby raising the problematical ethical issue of communicating relevant information to subjects at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two examples illustrate innovative strategic concepts: 1) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or an example of the successful de-intensification of treatment; and 2) <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> in young children, regarding which the desire to improve the quality of life has led to innovative attempts to replace radiotherapy by chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considerable progress has been made in the field of neuropsychology, thereby permitting an improved assessment of disorders and a better management of rehabilitation programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>New anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> agents and also chemo- and radiotherapy that spare healthy tissue are also being developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gene therapy and molecular biology will play a major role in future therapeutic strategies; and are now at the preclinical trial stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This significant overall progress leads to a reconsideration of the organizational approach toward treatment of the pediatric patient population suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and a critical assessment of disease management, which should take into account not only the technical aspects of the disease but also familial and social considerations </plain></SENT>
