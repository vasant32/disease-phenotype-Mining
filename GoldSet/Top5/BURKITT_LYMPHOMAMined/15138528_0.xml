<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study are: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To classify NHL cases in Jordan, using the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification system, 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To identify the most common types of NHL in Jordan, and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To compare <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types and patterns in Jordan with those in surrounding countries and the West </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL cases, diagnosed during 1996 through to 1999 inclusive, at 2 major medical centers in Jordan, in order to identify their main types and patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eleven cases of confirmed NHLs were reexamined and immunophenotyped in the year 2000, at the Department of Pathology, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan, using an immunohistochemical panel of antibodies, including CD3, CD15, CD20, CD30, CD43, CD45 and CD45RO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Confirmed NHL cases were reclassified according to the recently proposed WHO system of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Hematological Malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age of NHL cases was 44-years (range 2-85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of cases were of B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>; only 14% of the cases were T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most of the cases were of the aggressive intermediate to high-grade large cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) comprised 53% of NHLs and 62% of B-cell NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were uncommon, comprising 14% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine cases were seen among patients less than 20-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> represented the largest group (55%) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220612" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood NHLs</z:e> followed by diffuse large cell and lymphoblastic types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are rare in Jordan and account for less than 15% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; on the other hand, account for the majority of NHLs in Jordan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> affected children less than 10-years of age with a median of 4.5-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that NHLs in Jordan have different type distribution and patterns from those seen in the West </plain></SENT>
