<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, these IFN-sensitive and IFN-resistant cells have similar numbers of high-affinity IFN-alpha receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IFN-receptor complexes that are insoluble in <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100 accumulate in IFN-sensitive but not in IFN-resistant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ligand-induced accumulation of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi>-insoluble complexes in IFN-sensitive cells was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">cytochalasin</z:chebi> B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the solubility change of IFN-receptor complexes results from their interaction with the cytoskeletal matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dissociation of IFN-alpha from IFN-sensitive and IFN-resistant cells can be resolved into fast and slow components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IFN-alpha dissociates more slowly from IFN-sensitive cells than from IFN-resistant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Very slow dissociation of IFN-alpha from <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi>-insoluble complexes correlates with this difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that IFN-receptor complexes become coupled to the cytoskeletal matrix in IFN-sensitive but not in IFN-resistant cells, and that such interaction is an important element in the mechanism of the antiproliferative action of IFN-alpha on Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
