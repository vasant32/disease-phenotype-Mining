<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B-cell lines have identified two distinct forms of virus latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lymphoblastoid cell lines generated by virus-induced transformation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells in vitro, express the full spectrum of six EBNAs and three latent membrane proteins (LMP1, LMP2A, and LMP2B); furthermore, these lines often contain a small fraction of cells spontaneously entering the lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines retaining the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsy <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> express only one of the latent proteins, the nuclear antigen EBNA1; such cells do not enter the lytic cycle spontaneously but may be induced to do so by treatment with such agents as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> and anti-immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study set out to determine whether activation of full virus latent-gene expression was a necessary accompaniment to induction of the lytic cycle in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detailed analysis of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines responding to anti-immunoglobulin treatment revealed three response pathways of EBV gene activation from EBNA1-positive latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A first, rapid response pathway involves direct entry of cells into the lytic cycle without broadening of the pattern of latent gene expression; thereafter, the three "latent" LMPs are expressed as early lytic cycle antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A second, delayed response pathway in another cell subpopulation involves the activation of full latent gene expression and conversion to a lymphoblastoidlike <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A third response pathway in yet another subpopulation involves the selective activation of LMPs, with no induction of the lytic cycle and with EBNA expression still restricted to EBNA1; this type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> in B lymphocytes has hitherto not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the EBNA1+ LMP+ cells displayed some but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the phenotypic changes normally induced by LMP1 expression in a B-cell environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies highlight the existence of four different types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in B cells, including three distinct forms of latency, which we now term latency I, latency II, and latency III </plain></SENT>
