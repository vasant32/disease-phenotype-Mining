<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The accurate identification of MYC rearrangements in these three subtypes of high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is becoming increasingly critical both in terms of diagnosis of classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and in light of the prognostic implications in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and BCLU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe three cases of high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in which cryptic insertion events, resulting in clinically significant IGH-MYC rearrangements, were detectable using an IGH/MYC three-color, dual-fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe set, but were not detected using break-apart MYC FISH probes, thus highlighting the limitations of using break-apart probes as a stand-alone test, particularly with the increased use of interphase FISH analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections in the diagnostic work-up of these patients </plain></SENT>
