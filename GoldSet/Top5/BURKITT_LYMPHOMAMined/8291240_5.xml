<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B-LCL have also proven useful in the study of human immunology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a novel system for inducing efficient foreign gene expression in B-LCL using biotinylated adenovirus as an endosome-disrupting agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasmid DNA is coupled to the exterior of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> particles by streptavidin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53411">polylysine</z:chebi> chimeric proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Up to 67% of B-LCL may be induced to express foreign genes in vitro in transient expression systems, and gene expression lasts for at least 17 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have expressed firefly luciferase, beta-galactosidase (beta-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase, HIV gag, and env genes, as well as infectious HIV, and the EBV-specific BZLF gene in B-LCL with this system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo delivery of a beta-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi> reporter gene to B-LCL was documented in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Potential applications include study of genetic regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and transformation events, study of potential gene therapies for EBV-related B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and production of antigen-presenting cells for use in immunologic assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because of the high percentage of cells transformed and the length of foreign gene expression, the possibility of examining foreign gene expression in transient assays, without selection for clonal populations, exists </plain></SENT>
