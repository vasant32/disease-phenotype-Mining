<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recognition that the globotriaosyl moiety of this neutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi> is a receptor for Escherichia coli-derived Verotoxin-1 (Shiga-Like Toxin-1) offers a potential delivery system for the attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that CD77-expressing Group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells which are normally susceptible to activation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> on binding Verotoxin-1 B chain are protected in the presence of CD40 ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of either bcl-2 or bcl-xL also afforded resistance to the actions of the B chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total contrast, neither of the survival genes nor a CD40 signal - even when acting in concert - protected against killing mediated by the holotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that while therapeutic modalities for CD77-expressing B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (which include follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) based on the use of Verotoxin-1 B chain might be compromised by the activation of endogenous or exogenous survival pathways, those exploiting the holotoxin should be left unscathed </plain></SENT>
