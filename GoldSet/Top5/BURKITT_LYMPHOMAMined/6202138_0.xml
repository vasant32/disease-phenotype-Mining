<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the rosetting of B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) by peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) reflected possible interactions between lymphoid cells and immature cells of the hematopoietic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rosette formation could be blocked by the addition of soluble antigen extracted from B-LCL or blasts obtained from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This inhibition was specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blasts (similarly extracted material from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> lines had no inhibitory effect) and for the B-LCL receptor (leukemic extracts had no effect on surface receptors for sheep red blood cells (E) or antibody-sensitized red blood cells (EA)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The B-LCL receptor is present on leukemic Sezary T-cells as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T-cells and its sensitivity to various enzymatic treatments is markedly different from that of E and EA receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, B-LCLs derived from in vitro EB-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor's B lymphocytes were significantly rosetted by that donor's autologous PBLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggests the B-LCL receptor, present on mature T-cells, can recognize self determinants on myeloblasts and B-LCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further investigation will determine whether this interaction can affect the function of rosetted target cells </plain></SENT>
