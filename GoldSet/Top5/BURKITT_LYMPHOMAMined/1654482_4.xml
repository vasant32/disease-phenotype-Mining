<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This condition has been termed monoclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> of undetermined significance (MLUS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to search for functional differences between the monoclonal B-cell population of CLL (n = 3) and MLUS (n = 5) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MLUS derived B-cell populations were susceptible to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> measured as the production of EB nuclear antigen (EBNA) whereas CLL derived cells were resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 4 out of 5 MLUS patients, lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) like cell-clumps were formed, but not in CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clonal B-cell population from 2 of 5 MLUS patients was immortalized by EBV (LCL restricted to the expression of one Ig light chain) while no cell line emerged from the CLL patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study further enlarges previous observations and strengthens the assumption that MLUS clonal B cells are functionally close to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells while CLL B cells display various functional abnormalities </plain></SENT>
