<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DFMO (50-100 micrograms/ml) prevents proliferation although cells remain viable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon exposure to DFMO, lamellae with a few pores form within 2-3 days and well-developed stacks of annulate lamellae in 5-6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Formation of annulate lamellae involves the addition of electron-dense fibrous material to cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum while the latter are in close association with the Golgi complex </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following recovery from DFMO treatment, P3J cells appear similar to untreated ones in that they do not possess stacks of annulate lamellae </plain></SENT>
