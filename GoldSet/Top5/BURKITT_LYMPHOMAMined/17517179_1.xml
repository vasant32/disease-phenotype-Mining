<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can function as a target for T cell-mediated immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials of IgHV protein vaccines against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have demonstrated induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, complementary determining regions-based individual vaccines have disadvantages for wide clinical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although a recent study demonstrated that immunogenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> are derived from framework regions (FR) shared among patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, how to choose the appropriate <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> for each patient is still unsolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether immunoglobulin heavy chain FR-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> shared in each IgHV family are potential CTL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> presented by B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such CTL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> might be beneficial to shifting vaccination strategies against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> from individual specificity to family specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven IgHV gene families were amplified respectively by PCR and sequenced directly from 71 childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatics was applied in analyzing characteristics of sequences available and predicting HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> for each IgHV family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An antigen-specific T cell expansion system was used to generate <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-specific CTLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxicity of CTLs against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cells was assessed in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase release assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete IgHV rearrangements were identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 71 B-ALL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of 40 sequences available showed &gt; or = 98% homology with the nearest germline IgHV genes, indicating IgHV genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> of germline nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twelve nonapeptides of high HLA-A*0201-binding scores were obtained from 26 productive IgHV protein sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ten (83%) of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were located in FR1 and FR3 shared among the corresponding IgHV family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CTLs specific for the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> QLVQSGAEV located in FR1 (3 - 11) shared among the IgHV1 family could be successfully generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of two HLA-A*0201 + healthy donors in vitro and were capable of killing HLA-matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cell clones belonging to the IgHV1 family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> CTLs against immunoglobulin heavy chain FR-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> have family-specific cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
