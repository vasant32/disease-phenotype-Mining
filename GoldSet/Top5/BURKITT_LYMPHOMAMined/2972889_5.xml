<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Children with ALL diagnosed at less than 2 years of age have a poor prognosis when compared with older children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an effort to identify biologic features of ALL in children less than 2 that might explain this difference, we performed extensive immunophenotypic and molecular genetic analyses on a series of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For comparison purposes patients were divided into four groups: CALLA- (CD10-) infants less than 2 years of age at diagnosis (n = 10), CALLA- children greater than 2 years of age at diagnosis (n = 10), CALLA+ infants (less than 2 years, n = 21) and CALLA+ children (older than 2 years, n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No immunophenotyping differences in CALLA- or CALLA+ subgroups were identified when cases less than 2 were compared with cases greater than 2 years of age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most interesting results were in the CALLA- group where 94% of the samples expressed the B cell antigen CD19 but 27% co-expressed CD7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double labeling experiments confirmed leukemic blast cells co-expressed CD19 and CD7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The double-labeled cells represent either leukemic conversion of a precursor cell which has not yet committed to B or T cell lineage or aberrant expression of these antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic studies demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples, regardless of the patients' age or immunophenotype, had rearrangement of the Ig heavy chain gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most striking molecular results were in CALLA- patients; in patients less than 2 at diagnosis neither the beta- nor the gamma-chain gene of the T cell receptor (TCR) was rearranged, whereas DNA from 5 of 10 patients over the age of 2 demonstrated beta- or gamma-chain TCR gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CALLA+ cases under the age of 2 years with rearrangements in TCR genes is less than that found in CALLA+ cases over the age of 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The finding of no TCR rearrangements in CALLA- ALL and a decreased number of gamma-TCR rearrangements in CALLA+ cases under the age of 2 suggest that age may affect TCR gene rearrangements in lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The molecular differences in TCR gene rearrangements do not appear to correlate with the response to therapy </plain></SENT>
