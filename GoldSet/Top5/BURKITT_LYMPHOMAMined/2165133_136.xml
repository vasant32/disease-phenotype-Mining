<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serial passage of such lines is often accompanied by a broadening of virus latent gene expression and a corresponding change in the cell surface/growth phenotype towards that shown by in vitro transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sequence of events, both <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and cellular, involved in this transition needs to be defined properly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present work, phenotypically distinct cell clones have been derived from early passage cultures of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line in phenotypic transition, thereby giving access to relatively stable cell populations through which the different EBV-B cell interactions within the parental line can be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clones retaining the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> biopsy <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> (CD10/CD77-positive, activation antigen/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-negative) expressed the virus-encoded nuclear antigen EBNA 1 but not any of the other known latent proteins, EBNAs 2, 3a, 3b, 3c, -LP and latent membrane protein (LMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other clones which had developed an LCL-like phenotype (CD10/CD77-negative, activation antigen/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-positive) now expressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the above latent proteins and also contained significant numbers of cells in lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic change occurring within the parental <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line itself was initiated in a small subpopulation of cells in which the virus-encoded proteins EBNA 2 and LMP were transiently induced to an unusually high level of expression; this was accompanied by the first detectable changes in cell surface phenotype, namely the increase of cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some control over EBNA 2/LMP expression then appeared to be re-imposed since the presumed clonal descendents of these cells stably expressed EBNA 2 and LMP at much reduced levels typical of those seen in conventional LCLs </plain></SENT>
