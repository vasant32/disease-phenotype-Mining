<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC), only EBNA 1 is regularly expressed; LMP is detected in about 50% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, only EBNA 1 is expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-derived cell lines that maintain the phenotypic markers characteristic of the in vivo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> (group I), only EBNA 1 is expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBV was rescued by induction or cocultivation from one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line with a restricted group I pattern, and from one NPC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the resulting LCLs EBNA 1 to 6 and LMP were expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assessed the level of methylation in the genes encoding ENBNA 2 and LMP by restriction fragment analysis using the methylation-sensitive enzymes SmaI and HpaII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These genes were extensively methylated in the group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line Rael and the <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse-passaged C15 NPC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, but were demethylated in the derived LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the LMP-expressing NPC C15 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> the 5' flanking region of the gene was hypomethylated, whereas the coding exons were methylated [corrected] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The EBNA 1 coding exon was methylated in the Rael line and in NPC, in spite of expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CpG pairs in oriP were originally hypomethylated and remained so after their transfer to LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>-dependent pattern of EBV gene methylation correlated with the phenotype-dependent pattern of EBNA and LMP expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The specific patterns of methylation localized to controlling regions (oriP and 5' flanking sequences) also suggest a specific role for methylation in the regulation of EBNA and LMP expression </plain></SENT>
