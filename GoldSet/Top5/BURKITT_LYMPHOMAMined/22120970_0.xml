<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a subset of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are characterized by chromosomal alterations affecting the MYC oncogene on 8q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases MYC is found juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Translocations to the immunoglobulin kappa (IGK) gene locus on 2p11 are observed in around 5-10% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Little data exist on the molecular mechanisms leading to this aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal breakpoints on chromosome 8 have been found dispersed over a large area 3' of MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to obtain a better understanding of this chromosomal translocation we developed a long-distance inverse (LDI) PCR method for the identification of chromosomal translocations affecting the IGK locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We investigated a number of cytogenetically mostly uncharacterized high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples and identified a MYC-IGK juxtaposition in seven patients and three t(2;8)-positive cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal breakpoints were molecularly characterized and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The linear distance of the breakpoints on chromosome 8 to MYC ranged from some 100 bp to more than 0.5 MB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reciprocal translocated allele could be characterized in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study represents the largest series of t(2;8)-positive cases analyzed so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The LDI PCR method developed here should also be useful for the analysis of chromosomal translocations affecting the IGK locus in general </plain></SENT>
