<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possibility that an analogous effect is operative in lytically infected cells was suggested by the observation of distant sequence homology between an Epstein-Barr virus-coded early lytic cycle protein, BHRF1, and Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show by gene transfer that BHRF1 resembles Bcl-2 both in its subcellular localization and in its capacity to enhance B-cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus confocal microscopic analysis of cells acutely cotransfected with BHRF1 and Bcl-2 expression vectors revealed substantial colocalization of the two proteins in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In subsequent experiments, stable BHRF1 gene transfectants of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells paralleled Bcl-2 transfectants in their enhanced survival under conditions that induce cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite their limited sequence conservation, therefore, the two proteins appear to be functionally homologous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that BHRF1 provides an alternative, Bcl-2-independent, means of enhancing B-cell survival that may operate during the virus lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
