<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the effects of LMP1 have been most closely studied in human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines retaining a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsy-like phenotype in vitro, we have examined the response of a panel of such lines to CD40 ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two distinct patterns of response were observed that were unrelated to the surface level of CD40 or to the EBV genome status of the lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following exposure to either CD40-specific mAbs or the soluble trimeric ligand (sCD40L), high responder (HR) lines showed rapid aggregation, activation of NF-kappa B, up-regulation of cell surface markers ICAM-1/CD54 and Fas/CD95, and growth inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aggregation was seen at lower doses than those required to elicit the other effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, low responder (LR) lines showed no detectable response to CD40 mAbs, while their responses to sCD40L were limited to activation of NF-kappa B and up-regulation of CD95 only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in transfection experiments, LMP1 uniformly induced the full spectrum of phenotypic effects in both HR and LR lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines show a highly restricted response to CD40 ligation but remain fully susceptible to LMP1 </plain></SENT>
