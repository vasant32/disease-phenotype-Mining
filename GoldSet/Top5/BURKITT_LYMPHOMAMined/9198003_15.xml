<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cell cycle arrest in G1/G0 phase induced by type I IFNs, especially IFN-alpha, was recognized as a manifestation of their antiproliferative effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article, we report that the cell cycle block in G1/G0 is observed mainly in certain cell types, such as Daudi Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a variety of human transformed cells, but not nontransformed primary cells, IFN-beta and IFN-alpha induced a significant increase in the S phase population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase appeared to be due to a continued S phase entry and subsequently a failure of S phase cells to transit efficiently into G2 and M phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells to exhibit the S phase effect correlated with proper IFN signaling and loss or inactivation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> G1 checkpoint conferred by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein (pRB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overriding the G1 checkpoint switched human nontransformed primary cells from nonresponsive to sensitive to the IFN-induced effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the cell cycle regulatory machinery could function, at least in part, as a determining factor that affects the IFN-induced cell cycle effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IFN effect in transformed cells may suggest intriguing prospects for combinatorial therapies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
