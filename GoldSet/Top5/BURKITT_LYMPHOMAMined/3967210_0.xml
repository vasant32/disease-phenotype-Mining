<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One had two acrocentric marker chromosomes comprised of material from chromosome #1 (1q21----q44) translocated to the Y gonosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other two cases had a cytogenetic alteration of chromosome #12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies carried out systematically in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> could be a great help in possibly establishing differences in the biologic and clinical aspects of cases presenting with the t(8;14) versus cases with variant translocations, as this would allow for classification of these patients into groups which, at present, cannot be differentiated using other diagnostic methods </plain></SENT>
