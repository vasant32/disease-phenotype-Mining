<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients were treated with BCG, and 19 were controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients in each group relapsed during a follow-up period long enough to make it unlikely that further relapses would occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the length of remission or the site of relapse that could be attributed to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients died: of these none of the six patients in the BCG group but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the five in the control group had stage D <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BCG treatment increased the rate of recovery from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-induced immunosuppression, but within the BCG group immunocompetence improved most rapidly in the patients who relapsed-a finding that appears to contradict the tenet retionalising the use of immunological adjuvants as treatment </plain></SENT>
