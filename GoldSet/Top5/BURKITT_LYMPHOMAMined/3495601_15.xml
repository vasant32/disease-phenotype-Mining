<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Incubation of purified peripheral blood lymphocytes for 4 days with autologous AM and 1 U/ml of IL 2 resulted in AM-mediated suppression of LAK activity, whereas peripheral blood monocytes isolated freshly by centrifugal elutriation from the same donor potentiated induction of LAK activity by IL 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The suppression of LAK cell induction by human AM was dependent on the density of AM added to the lymphocyte cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recombinant IFN-gamma did not affect AM-mediated suppression of LAK cell induction by IL 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both AM and monocytes stimulated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> markedly suppressed LAK cell induction by IL 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AM-mediated down-regulation was seen only when AM were added immediately after the start of incubation of lymphocytes with IL 2; AM potentiated LAK activity when added 1 day later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar AM-mediated suppression of LAK cell induction was observed with four lines of allogeneic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> cells as targets for LAK activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that AM may be important in regulation of in situ induction of LAK activity in the lung </plain></SENT>
