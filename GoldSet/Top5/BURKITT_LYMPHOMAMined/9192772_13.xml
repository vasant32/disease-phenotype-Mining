<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A specific molecular activity for the Bcl-2 protein has not been identified, but several lines of evidence have supported a role in protection of cells from <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether there is a correlation between expression of high levels of Bcl-2 and susceptibility of human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>-induced killing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> required to kill 50% of cells in 24 hours varied widely in the seven different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines that were tested, ranging from 35 to 500 micromol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, expression of high levels of endogenous Bcl-2 did not protect the cells from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>-induced killing, even though it was effective in protecting the cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by agents such as A23187 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, Bcl-2 was functional in preventing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> but did not act in an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were confirmed using a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line overexpressing transfected bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results may be explained by the observation that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> was inefficient at inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in these mature B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonapoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> was not prevented by Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
