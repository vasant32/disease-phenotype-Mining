<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent report has found Epstein-Barr virus genome in association with 4 of 11 cases (36%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002242'>enteropathy</z:hpo>-associated T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective study, we have characterized 22 consecutive cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002242'>enteropathy</z:hpo>-associated T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from the West of Ireland where <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> is endemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were immunophenotyped with T- and B-cell markers including the anaplastic large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> marker CD30 or Ki-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen cases were studied for latent membrane protein expression and 16 for Epstein-Barr virus small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> by in situ hybridization using EBER oligonucleotides on routinely processed sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 1 of 16 cases (6%) showed Epstein-Barr virus in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and no cases stained with latent membrane protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight of 22 cases (36%) including the EBER-positive case were positive for CD30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the Epstein-Barr virus does not commonly play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002242'>enteropathy</z:hpo>-associated T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from this area </plain></SENT>
