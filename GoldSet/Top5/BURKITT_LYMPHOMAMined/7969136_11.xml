<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An in vivo footprint over a potential NF-kappa B site in the first exon of the c-myc gene has been identified on the translocated allele in the Ramos Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential NF-kappa B site in the 5' flanking sequence of c-myc was found to be occupied on the translocated allele in the Raji Burkitt's cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with each of these sequences demonstrated complexes with mobilities identical to those of the NF-kappa B site from the kappa light-chain gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A supershift was obtained with anti-p50 antibody with the exon site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The upstream-site shift complex disappeared with the addition of anti-p50 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binding of NF-kappa B proteins to the c-myc exon and upstream sites was demonstrated by induction of binding upon differentiation of pre-B 70Z/3 cells to B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>UV cross-linking experiments revealed that a protein with a molecular mass of 50 kDa bound to the exon and upstream sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transfection experiments with Raji cells demonstrated that both sites functioned as positive regulatory regions, with a drop in activity level when either site was mutated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Access to these sites is blocked in the silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc allele in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, while Rel family proteins bind to these sites in the translocated allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the two NF-kappa B sites function as positive regulatory regions for the translocated c-myc gene in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
