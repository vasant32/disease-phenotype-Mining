<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations disrupting the nuclear localization signal of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo>-related gene RB2/p130 have been documented recently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given the importance of the RB2/p130 gene in controlling cell growth, mutations of this gene may result in uncontrolled cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the expression and genomic organization of the RB2/p130 gene in relation to the proliferative features of a series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> samples collected from the endemic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> regions, regardless of whether the samples were acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>)-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of the Rb2/p130, p107, and cell proliferation-related proteins (cyclin A and B) was determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The structures of exons 19 through 22 of the RB2/p130 gene, encoding for the B domain and C terminus, were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The direct PCR products were sequenced to identify the actual mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> is composed of a mixture of molecular types with distinct genetic and phenotypic patterns, probably resulting from different pathogenetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, the RB2/p130 gene is mutated in most of the cases, and the protein is restricted to the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, high levels of nuclear expression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> pRb2/p130, p107, and cell proliferation-related proteins were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding is in line with the molecular mechanisms observed in virus-linked <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000351'>increased cell proliferation</z:mp> due to different alterations of cell growth control by Rb-related proteins may be the first step in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, during which additional genetic changes, including missense mutations of c-myc, may subsequently occur </plain></SENT>
