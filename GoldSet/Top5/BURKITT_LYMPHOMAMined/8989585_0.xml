<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the bulk protocol, the PBMC were stimulated with 100 ng/mL SEB for 3 days before separation to CD4+ and CD8+ T subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the direct protocol, the separated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were stimulated with 100 ng SEB preabsorbed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>)-treated APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the results of the two different protocols revealed the following differences: (i) PBMC in the direct protocol provided greater cytolytic activity than in the bulk protocol; and (ii) the CD4+ T cells acquired cytotoxicity only in the direct protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, the superantigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (SDCC) of SEB-stimulated cells was not dominant compared with the basal cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The classical NK target, K-562 was also sensitive to SEB-augmented cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The parallel stimulation with IL-2 and SEB caused a similar extent of cytotoxicity enhancement against both types of target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CSA) inhibited only the SEB-induced cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that SEB-induced PBMC acquire mainly a LAK-like cytotoxicity, as a consequence of newly produced lymphokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This observation might propose a different approach in pathological studies </plain></SENT>
