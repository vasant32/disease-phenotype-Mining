<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The capacity of highly purified preparations of ricin A and B chains to reconstitute ricin toxicity both in vitro and in vivo was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When the nontoxic A and B chain subunits were mixed and electrophoresed on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gels (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE), reconstituted ricin was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mixtures killed cells of the human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Daudi in vitro and killed mice after i.v. injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was also shown that when mice were injected with one ricin subunit followed by administration of the complementary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> up to 8 hr later, they died with lesions similar to those of ricin-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that A and B chains recombine either in the serum or on the surface of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of clearance of A and B chains from the blood of rats indicated that sufficient concentrations of either chain were present in the circulation 8 hr after injection to account for the observed toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The above studies therefore suggest that the subunits of ricin have a very high affinity for each other and are capable of reconstituting biologically active ricin in vitro and in injected mice </plain></SENT>
