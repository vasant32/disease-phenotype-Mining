<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A simple and convenient method for efficiently establishing 8-azaguanine-resistant mutant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines (for example, the T cell lines Jurkat and CCRF-CEM, human myeloid/macrophage-like cell lines HL60 and U937, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line Raji and the human <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> line RPMI 8226), is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method relies on culturing the cell lines in RPMI 1640 medium containing 8-azaguanine and supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and large amounts of amino acids and vitamins, and removes the necessity for pretreatment with mutagenic reagents such as ethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25224">methylsulfonate</z:chebi> or X-irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The possibility of obtaining mutant cell lines using the method described here is about 15 times greater than using media without high levels of amino acids and vitamins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hybridomas produced between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes and an 8-azaguanine-resistant Jurkat mutant cell line (established by this method) were shown to produce soluble T cell-derived macrophage activating factor (MAF)-like material </plain></SENT>
