<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activation of the JAK/STAT pathway has been implicated in IL-7R signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated which STAT complexes are formed upon stimulation of B cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (BCP-ALL) cells with IL-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gel retardation assays with STAT-binding oligonucleotides showed that IL-7 induces the formation of two major STAT complexes in BCP-ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Supershifts with anti-STAT antibodies identified these as STAT1 and STAT5 complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This pattern of STAT activation was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BCP-ALL cases that respond to IL-7 in proliferation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-7 also induced STAT/DNA binding in BCP-ALL cases that failed to proliferate in response to IL-7, suggesting that the ability of IL-7R to activate the JAK/STAT pathway per se is not sufficient for proliferation induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine the contribution of the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7R alpha) to activation of STAT proteins, transfectants of the murine pro-B cell line BAF3 were made that express chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular domain of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R) and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of human IL-7R alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activation of the chimeric G-CSF-R/IL-7R alpha with G-CSF resulted in a full proliferative response and induced the phosphorylation of JAK1 but not JAK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Major STAT complexes activated by G-CSF-R/IL-7R alpha contained STAT1 or STAT5, while some formation of STAT3-containing complexes was also seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings establish that STAT1 and STAT5, and possibly STAT3, are activated upon stimulation of precursor B cells with IL-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data further indicate that the IL-7R alpha chains are directly involved in the activation of JAKs and STATs and have a major role in proliferative signaling in precursor B cells </plain></SENT>
