<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that upon surface immunoglobulin cross-linking followed by co-culture with activated cloned T cells, the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BL2 is induced to mutate its IgV(H) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repeated activation of BL2 cells increased the frequency of mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The in vitro-induced mutations, which do not affect the IgM constant region, are point mutations distributed over the entire V(H)DJ(H) gene segment and do not show evidence of antigen-driven selection </plain></SENT>
