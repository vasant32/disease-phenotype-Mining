<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, biochemical, cell biological, and genetic studies have converged to reveal that integral membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> (HSPGs) are critical regulators of growth and differentiation of epithelial and connective tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a large number of cytokines involved in lymphoid tissue homeostasis or <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> contain potential HS-binding domains, HSPGs presumably also play important roles in the regulation of the immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we explored the expression, regulation, and function of HSPGs on B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that activation of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and/or CD40 induces a strong transient expression of HSPGs on human tonsillar B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By means of these HSPGs, the activated B cells can bind hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a cytokine that regulates integrin-mediated B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This interaction with HGF is highly selective since the HSPGs did not bind the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1 alpha, even though the affinities of HGF and SDF-1alpha for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> are similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the activated B cells, we observed induction of a specific HSPG isoform of CD44 (CD44-HS), but not of other HSPGs such as syndecans or glypican-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the expression of CD44-HS on B cells strongly promotes HGF-induced signaling, resulting in an HS-dependent enhanced phosphorylation of Met, the receptor tyrosine kinase for HGF, as well as downstream signaling molecules including Grb2-associated binder 1 (Gab1) and Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that the BCR and CD40 control the expression of HSPGs, specifically CD44-HS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These HSPGs act as functional coreceptors that selectively promote cytokine signaling in B cells, suggesting a dynamic role for HSPGs in antigen-specific B cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
