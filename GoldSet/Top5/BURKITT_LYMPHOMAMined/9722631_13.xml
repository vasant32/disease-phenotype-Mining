<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aside from an N-terminal acidic transcriptional activation domain, little is known about how this factor functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extensive mutagenesis of CIITA was undertaken to identify structural motifs required for function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability of mutants to activate a reporter gene under the control of MHC class II conserved W-X-Y or X-Y regulatory elements was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two mutants displayed differential activity between the two promoters, activating transcription with the W-X-Y but not the X-Y elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mutants were tested for their ability to interfere with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> CIITA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five CIITA mutant constructions were able to down-regulate <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> CIITA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of these mutants contained targeted disruptions of potential functional motifs: the acidic activation domain, a putative <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-binding motif and two leucine charged domains (LCD motifs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other two contained mutations in regions that do not have homology to described proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The characterization of CIITA mutants that are able to discriminate between promoters with or without the W box strongly suggests that CIITA requires such interactions for function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The identification of LCD motifs required for CIITA function brings to light a previously undefined role of these motifs in CIITA function </plain></SENT>
