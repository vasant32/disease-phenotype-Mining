<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through the corresponding imidazolidates, these oligonucleotide 5'-monophosphates were converted to the 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphates</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When evaluated for its ability to bind to the 2-5 A-dependent endonuclease of mouse L cells, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48267">tubercidin</z:chebi> analogue of trimeric 2-5A, namely, ppp5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A), and the corresponding tetramer were bound as effectively as 2-5A itself; nonetheless, it and the corresponding tetramer, ppp5'-(c7A)2'p5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A), failed to stimulate the 2-5A-dependent endonuclease as judged by its inability to inhibit translation in extracts of mouse L cells programmed with encephalomyocarditis virus <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and to give rise to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> cleavage in the same cell system under conditions where 2-5A showed activity at 10(-9) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The trimer, ppp5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A), was an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of 2-5A action in the L cell extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the lysed rabbit reticulocyte system, both the trimeric and tetrameric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48267">tubercidin</z:chebi> 2-5A analogues were bound to the 2-5A-dependent endonuclease as well as 2-5A, but in this case, the tetramer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>, ppp5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A)2'p5'(c7A), was just as potent an inhibitor of translation as 2-5A tetramer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
