<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aminoethyl-Sephadex G-25 beads labelled with different amounts of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>) were used to calibrate an Epics V cell sorter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The quantity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> molecules bound per bead was found to be a linear function of relative fluorescence intensity expressed by channel number for intermediate and high levels of fluorescence and a non-linear function for low levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lowest limit of detectable fluorescence was 3400 FITC molecules bound per bead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (m.Ab.) the number of HLA class I molecules expressed at the surface of murine LMTK- (H-2Kk) cells transfected by cloned HLA class I genes was estimated and compared with the amount expressed on human B (Raji) and T (MOLT 4) lymphoblastoid reference cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Murine transformed cells expressed approximately 3 times less HLA class I determinants per surface unit (micrometer 2) than Raji cells and 1.4 times less than MOLT 4 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained by Scatchard analysis of the same populations using radiolabelled m.Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A detailed analysis of fluorescent cells showed that 5-20% of transformed cells expressed less than 33,000 HLA class I molecules/cell whereas most MOLT 4 cells exhibited at least 280,000 molecules/cell and the majority of Raji cells more than 700,000 molecules/cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of foreign antigen did not reduce the amount of H-2Kk molecules at the surface of transformed cells (mean of 350,000 molecules/cell) </plain></SENT>
