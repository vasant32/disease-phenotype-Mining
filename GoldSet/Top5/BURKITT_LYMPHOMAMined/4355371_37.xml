<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under the fractionation conditions used, intact Epstein-Barr virus DNA from virus particles can be separated from the less-dense cellular DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a large proportion of the intrinsic Epstein-Barr virus DNA component of Raji cells remains associated with cellular DNA, as determined by nucleic acid hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This interaction, which is resistant to Pronase and <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> treatment, is not the result of aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the molecular weight of Raji DNA is reduced by hydrodynamic shear, the amount of virus DNA associated with cell DNA decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, some virus DNA still remains bound to fragments of cellular DNA after shearing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association is completely destroyed in alkaline solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Molecular weight analysis of Raji DNA after denaturation showed that the alkali-induced release of Epstein-Barr virus DNA was specific and not the result of random single-strand breaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that Epstein-Barr virus DNA is linearly integrated into Raji cell DNA by alkali-labile bonds </plain></SENT>
