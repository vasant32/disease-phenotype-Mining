<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We isolated peripheral lymphocytes from blood drawn from patients before and after the chemotherapy and collected Microscopic FTIR (FTIR-MC) spectra of the isolated lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that nucleic acids content decreased in both types of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and proteins level could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall effects of drugs administered to the patients can be understood at the molecular level using FTIR-MC and these results are expected to stimulate wider applications of spectroscopy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> research </plain></SENT>
