<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The recently identified ETV6/CBFA2 (formerly known as <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>/AML1) fusion gene occurs as a result of the t(12;21)(p12;q22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial reports have indicated that the fusion transcript occurs in up to 30% of children diagnosed with B-cell precursor (CD10+, CD19+) <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to characterize the incidence of the t(12;21) at both the chromosomal level as well as the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcript level, we have used a combination of classical cytogenetics, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to examine the bone marrow of 34 children diagnosed with B-cell precursor ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 34 patient samples expressed the ETV6/CBFA2 transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the results of RT-PCR were compared with the conventional karyotype, the fusion was present in 3 of 10 (33%) with chromosome 12 abnormalities, none of whom had an obvious t(12;21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The transcript was also detected in 5 of the 12 (41%) bone marrow samples with other abnormalities and in 1 of 12 (8%) samples with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 9 RT-PCR positive patient samples were studied with FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 7, FISH confirmed the ETV6/CBFA2 fusion in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One other patient with a 12p abnormality had evidence for the fusion using FISH which was not detected by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results not only confirm that the frequency of the t(12;21) is unusually high in childhood B-cell precursor ALL, but also that none of the translocations in our series was detected with conventional cytogenetic techniques </plain></SENT>
