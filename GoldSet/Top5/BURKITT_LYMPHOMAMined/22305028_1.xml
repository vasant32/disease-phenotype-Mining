<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>My favored treatment approach for patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> continues to evolve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can now be cured in more than 50% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a result of improved definitions of the disease, improved diagnostic capabilities, better staging and restaging techniques, a useful prognostic index to guide therapeutic decisions, and the development of increasingly effective therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomographic scans have improved the accuracy of both staging and restaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Findings on a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomographic scan at the end of therapy are the best predictors of a good treatment outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Numerous subtypes of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have been identified that require specific treatment approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For example, plasmablastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> typically lacks CD20 and does not benefit from treatment with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> originating in specific extranodal sites such as the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, testes, and skin presents special problems and requires specific treatment approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a very high proliferative rate seems to have a poor outcome when treated with CHOP-R and does better with regimens used for patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New insights into the biology of these disorders are likely to further change treatment approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recognition that diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is not one disease, but a variety of clinicopathologic syndromes provides the opportunity to further improve our ability to benefit patients </plain></SENT>
