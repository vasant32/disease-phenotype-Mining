<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This protein in extracts of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells differed by overall charge and phosphorylation from the 47 KDa protein isolated from B lymphocytes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before and after purification the 47 KDa protein of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells reacted with an antibody directed against the dodecapeptide Arg-Arg-Leu<z:chebi fb="84" ids="32607">-Ile</z:chebi>-Glu-Asp<z:chebi fb="1" ids="32654">-Asn</z:chebi>-Glu-Tyr-Thr-Ala-Arg (conserved region of pp60src), the 47 KDa protein from B cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> origin did not; the same protein from both cell lines reacted with anti-pp60src antibody </plain></SENT>
