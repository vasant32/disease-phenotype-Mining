<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> can avoid T cell-mediated attack through multiple mechanisms including downregulation of major histocompatability complex (MHC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, engineering T cells to target intact protein antigen directly, thus bypassing the need for MHC presentation, can facilitate T cell targeting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood lymphocytes from nine of nine patients with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) were successfully gene-modified to express a receptor consisting of a CD19 single chain variable fragment (scFv) fused to the T cell CD3zeta signalling molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These T cells were functionally active against the CD19(+) Raji Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, engineered T cells from seven of nine NHL patients efficiently lysed autologous lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> biopsy cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a clear correlation between levels of CD19 expression on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and effective killing by the engineered T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For two patients with a low or absent CD19(+) cells within the biopsy, no significant killing was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that patients with CD19(+) NHL would be suitable candidates for this form of therapy in the setting of a phase I clinical trial </plain></SENT>
