<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A series of 5' deletion test plasmids harboring promoter sequences of the HLA-DQ beta gene fused to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> transferase (CAT) gene were constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transient CAT expression from these constructs in several types of cells was employed to examine the role of the promoter sequence in the regulation of DQ beta gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The DQ beta constructs drove CAT expression in Raji cells (human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells) to at least 25-fold or 50-fold higher levels than in Hela cells (human cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells) or Jurkat cells (human T-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A short promoter sequence of -160 bp containing the conserved X and Y sequences was sufficient for expression in Raji cells, and deletion to -106 bp which interrupted the X sequence abolished the expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequences further upstream to -160 bp as far as -2500 bp which included an Ig-like octamer appeared to have no effect on expression in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the promoter up to -160 bp has <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the sequences required for B cell specific expression of CAT in this assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CAT expression from the 5' deletion constructs introduced into RJ2.2.5 and 6.1.6 cells (class II-negative mutant B cells lines) was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the 5' deletion constructs, including that with -160 bp of promoter, showed CAT expression in these cells, suggesting that a transcriptional factor(s) required for the activity of the DQ beta promoter was missing in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the -160 to -66 bp sequence (including the X and Y elements), which functions as a B cell specific enhancer, was inactive in the mutant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the missing factor(s) are required for the enhancer function of this fragment </plain></SENT>
