<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A combination of chromosomal translocations associated with bcl-2 re-arrangement (t(14;18)) and c-myc re-arrangement (t(8;14), t(8;22), or t(2;8)) is a rare event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the first cell line exhibiting t(14;18) and t(8;22), which will enable us to study the interactions of bcl-2 and c-myc systematically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell culture was started with circulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells from the peripheral blood of an adult male Caucasian patient with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> after the second relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells grew spontaneously without cytokines, fulfilled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> criteria of a cell line and were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome-negative cell line (DoGKiT) has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RC-banding analysis of the chromosomes showed a complex karyotype with a modal number of 48, XY, dup(1)(q31;q44), t(8;22)(q24;q11), der(10), t(14;18)(q32;q21), add(16)(pter), dup(17)(q12q24), +der(18), +20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of t(8;22)(q24;q11), a variant translocation of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and t(14;18)(q32;q21), typical for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), was confirmed by FISH and SKY-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surface marker studies of the cell line showed that the cells were positive for CALLA (CD10), CD19, cyCD22, cyCD79a and HLA-DR and negative for TdT, IgM, CD5 and CD23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first established cell line carrying these two translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to already established cell lines carrying the more common combination of t(8;14)(q24;q32) and t(14;18)(q32;q21) with both IgH alleles being involved in translocations, the cell line DoGKiT carries only one translocated IgH allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This cell line may serve as an important tool in the study of the combination of the chromosomal translocations t(14;18) and t(8;22) and in molecular genetic studies of transformed FL </plain></SENT>
