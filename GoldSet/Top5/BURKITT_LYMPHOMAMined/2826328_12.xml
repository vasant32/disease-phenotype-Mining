<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cylindrical confronting cisternae (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi>), also known as test-tube and ring-shaped forms, are frequently present in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes and occasionally in other cells from patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data indicate that the presence of these cisternae and tubuloreticular structures (TRS) in lymphocytes from patients at risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> is predictive of the development of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> are formed by an alteration of the membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, but the mechanism by which they are formed or demonstration of their induction by specific agents has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We cultured Daudi lymphoblastoid cells in medium containing recombinant alpha-interferon and induced the formation of both TRS and <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> formed in Daudi cells was directly proportional to the concentration of interferon used and the length of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> were in direct continuity with TRS, which were induced in cells by interferon at an earlier time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of cell sections containing TRS stayed the same or decreased somewhat after 72 hours of culture, whereas the number of <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> could be present in various cells from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and other diseases as a result of elevated interferon levels in these conditions </plain></SENT>
