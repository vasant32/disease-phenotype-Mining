<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fresh and transformed human B lineage cells were found to be sensitive to the cytotoxic action of Shiga-like toxin (SLT), a <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> cytotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The toxin was specifically bound by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> globotriosylceramide and galabiosylceramide expressed on the surface of sensitive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutant Daudi cells selected for resistance to SLT cytotoxicity (SLTR20) were deficient in SLT-binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> and failed to bind SLT to their surface, suggesting a role for these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> in the mediation of SLT cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of a number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and transformed lymphoid and myeloid cells screened for SLT sensitivity, only B lymphoid cells were susceptible to SLT action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, B lymphoid cells were the only cells expressing the SLT binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro B cell activation studies with Epstein-Barr virus and pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> both indicated that the vast majority of SLT-sensitive B cells belong to the IgG and IgA committed subset, whereas most IgM and IgM/D producing cells were resistant to SLT toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The selective elimination of IgG and IgA committed cells may explain the production of only IgM class anti-SLT antibodies in Shigella-infected humans leading to the failure of long-term immunity to dysenteric disease </plain></SENT>
