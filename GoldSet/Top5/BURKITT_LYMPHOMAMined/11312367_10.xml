<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>) can be infected in vitro with prototype EBV strains to study how the virus may affect the phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies thus far have concentrated on the use of transforming B95-8 and nontransforming P3HR1 strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunological and phenotypic differences between the sublines infected with these two strains were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of these differences, if not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, can be attributed to the lack of EBNA-2 coding sequences in the P3HR1 strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recent development of a selectable Akata strain has opened up new possibilities for infecting epithelial and T cells as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We infected five EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines with the recombinant Akata virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the infected cell lines BL28, Ramos, and DG75 express EBNA-1, EBNA-2, and LMP1, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> proteins associated with type III latency, and use both YUK and QUK splices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, two EBV-negative variants of Akata and Mutu when reinfected displayed restricted type I latency and expressed only EBNA-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> clones of infected Mutu cells used the QUK splice exclusively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The usage of Qp was observed in a majority of Akata clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some Akata clones, however, were found to have double promoter usage (Qp and C/Wp) but at 4 months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> did not express EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate differential regulation of EBV latency in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> with the same recombinant <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> strain and suggest that the choice of latency type may be cell dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The restricted latency observed for infected Akata and Mutu cells indicates that a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> may opt for type I latency in the absence of immune pressure as well </plain></SENT>
