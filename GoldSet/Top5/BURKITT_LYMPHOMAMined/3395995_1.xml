<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A constant lymphoblastoid line Raji (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) has been used as a model for population cytogenetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In analyzing 100 G-banded metaphase plates, four karyotypically distinct clones of cells with 48 chromosomes have been recognized, forming a modal class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In tracing the origin of marker chromosomes (in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15), the presence of material specific for Burkitt chromosome markers 14q+ and 8q- has been shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The application of the method of karyotype reconstruction has shown a uniformity in the overall chromosome material of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four groups of cells despite a different set of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of 40% of cells with unique structural rearrangements (USR) demonstrated, to a significant extent, the structural instability of chromosomes in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nonrandom nature of distribution of "hot spots" along the chromosomes in the process of formation of both markers and USR has been shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A preferential involvement of chromosomes #6, #7, and #8, as well as of separate regions 1p32, 6q15, 11q13, and 21p13 has been recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This report discusses aspects of karyotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of cell populations in vitro and structural instability of regions of chromosomes #1 and #11, that coincide with the localization of the oncogene L-MYC or sequence BLYM-1 and the oncogene BCL-1 </plain></SENT>
