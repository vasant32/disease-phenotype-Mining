<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> (13) EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines were CALLA+ LB-1-, whereas 30 EBV-carrying lines showed a more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the EBV-negative lines, the follicle mantle zone markers BA-1 and 35.1C5 were expressed concordantly, at a different level in each line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This coordination was disrupted in EBV-carrying lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the EBV-negative lines, there was also an inverted correlation between the expression of 35.1C5 and the germinal center marker BLA, suggesting that some etiologically important event, perhaps the translocation, had fixed the cells at different stages of their transition from one zone to the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This inverted relationship was also disrupted in the EBV-carrying lines, suggesting that EBV can interfere with the maturation program of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This conclusion was also supported by a comparison between 5 EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines and their EBV-converted sublines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> converted lines have undergone marker changes, but the degree and nature of these changes was different for each EBV-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both the coordinated expression of BA-1 and 35.1C5 and the inverted relationship between CALLA and LB-1 were disrupted in several other convertants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have reexamined our previous finding (Ehlin-Henriksson and Klein, 1984) that the majority of the variant translocation-carrying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines were CALLA- LB-1+, in contrast to the majority of the typical translocation carriers that were mostly CALLA+ LB-1- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> II EBV-negative lines were CALLA+ LB-1-, irrespective of the type of translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the EBV-carrying lines, 4 of 17 typical (8;14) translocation carriers were CALLA- LB-1+, whereas 7 of the 12 variant translocation-carrying lines were CALLA- LB-1+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remaining two expressed both antigens to some extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The difference is statistically significant at the 0.03 level </plain></SENT>
