<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study was conducted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ALL cases (&lt; or = 12 years old) diagnosed and treated in University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia between 1 January 1992 and 30 May 1995, with available immunophenotype data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presenting features and treatment outcome of 39 B-lineage ALL patients with myeloid antigen coexpression (My+B) were compared with 112 B-lineage ALL patients without myeloid antigen coexpression (My-B) for similarity in demographic, clinical and laboratory features and their treatment outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>My+B and My-B patients were treated with a uniform treatment protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myeloid antigen coexpression was defined as more than 30% isolated leukemic cells positive for CD13 and/or CD33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ages at diagnoses ranged from 2 months to 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median age was 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of myeloid antigen coexpression was 23 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses showed that presenting features were similar between My+B and My-B with regard to age, sex, race, FAB <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, white cell count, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, platelet count, liver/spleen size, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system or mediastinal involvement, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, and proportion of blast cells detected in the marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment outcome were not significant between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 2-year event free survival was achieved in 44 per cent of My+B and 57 per cent of My-B (p = 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 2-year overall survival rates were 62 per cent for My+B vs. 77 per cent for My-B (p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that myeloid antigen coexpression is fairly common and constitutes 23 per cent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> within the Malaysian population and that it is not an adverse risk factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
