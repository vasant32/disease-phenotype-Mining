<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic and molecular genetic characteristics of 4 variant sublines of the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Namalwa have been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sublines are DNA-fingerprint-identical and derived from a monoclonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, as shown by a rearrangement of the T-cell-receptor beta-chain gene common to the 4 sublines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is non-co-ordinate expression of MHC class-I MHC class-II, surface immunoglobulin and a number of antigens recognized by CD MAbs on the different sublines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These different phenotypes of the cells are reminiscent of B cells arrested in varying states of cellular maturity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On Southern blots there are different patterns of restriction fragments hybridizing with Ig heavy- and light-chain gene probes among the sublines, indicating that multiple rearrangements or mutations of Ig genes have occurred in the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different patterns of hybridizing fragments among the sublines were also found by using c-myc probes, implying the existence of different mutations of the c-myc locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The c-myc mutation found in one of the sublines mapped to the 5' flanking sequence and in another 3' to the c-myc locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using the J17BS8 probe, which detects a restriction fragment length polymorphism in the 3' flanking region of the c-myc gene, a 4-fold variation in the gene copy number among the subline was found and one of the sublines was shown to be hemizygous for c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Examination of DNA from early cultures of Namalwa cells showed that the alternations in Ig and c-myc structure had occurred on prolonged culture of the cells </plain></SENT>
