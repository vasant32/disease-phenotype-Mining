<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human neoplastic cell lines used were HeLa (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007847" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">uterine cervical cancer</z:e>), MCF-7 (mammary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>), WI-38 CT-1 (embryonic lung fibroblasts transformed in culture by Co-60 gamma-ray irradiation), KMM-1 (<z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>) and Raji (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human cell strain used was WI-38 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human lung fibroblasts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic effects were determined by colony formation for HeLa, MCF-7, WI-38 CT-1 and WI-38 cells, and by cell growth for KMM-1 and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each cell line was different in sensitivity to interferon or 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interferon potentiated synergistically the cytotoxic effects of 5-FU on HeLa, WI-38 CT-1 and KMM-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the case of Raji cells, the cytotoxic effects of the combination of interferon and 5-FU were additive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither synergistic nor additive lethal effects of the combination of the 2 agents were observed in MCF-7 and WI-38 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate a possibility that interferon and 5-FU can mutally reduce the amount of the other needed to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
