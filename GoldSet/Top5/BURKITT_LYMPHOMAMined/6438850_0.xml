<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a Burkitt's type lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-LL) case characterized by an abnormal IgMk immunoglobulin secretion and referred to us on February 12, 1982 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis has been histologically documented and the pathological stage of the disease (IV B) was determined according to the diagnostic criteria usually employed for the non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum proteins were determined by electrophoresis and immunodiffusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The review of the literature has allowed us to ascertain that the presence of a monoclonal IgM peak can be associated with NHL, particularly with those of B cell type and in adult subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Up to now, only six IgM B-LL secreting cases have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The biological and prognostic significance of this elevated Ig secretion is uncertain; therefore it may be important for the future to evaluate, in B-LL this immunological parameter </plain></SENT>
