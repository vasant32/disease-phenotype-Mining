<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the nature and the biological relevance of these homodimers have not yet been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we demonstrated that Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells and CD40-transfected HEK 293 cells constitutively expressed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-linked CD40/CD40 homodimers at low levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oligomerization of CD40 leads to a rapid and significant increase in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-linked CD40/CD40 homodimer formation, a response that could be prevented using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Formation of CD40/CD40 homodimers was found to be absolutely required for CD40-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which, in turn regulated B7.2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CD40 monomers provided the minimal signal emerging from CD40, activating p38 MAP kinase and inducing homotypic B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD40/CD40 homodimer formation was totally independent of TRAF1/2/3/5 associations with the threonine at position 254 in the cytoplasmic tail of the CD40 molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding may be vital to better understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern cell signaling triggered by CD40/CD154 interactions </plain></SENT>
