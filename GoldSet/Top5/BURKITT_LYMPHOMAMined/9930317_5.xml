<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of EBV is a transmembrane protein that is essential for the transformation of B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LMP1-mediated up-regulation of Bcl-2 is thought to be an important element in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As an approach to explore novel treatments for EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, we constructed a single-chain antibody (sFv) directed against LMP1 to achieve functional inhibition of this oncoprotein in EBV-transformed B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that intracellular expression of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted form of this sFv markedly reduced LMP1 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also observed a decrease in intracellular level of this protein which correlated with a marked reduction of Bcl-2 expression in EBV-transformed B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrated that anti-LMP1 sFv-mediated reduction of Bcl-2 correlated with increased sensitivity of these cells to drug-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these data suggest that an anti-LMP1 sFv used in combination with conventional chemotherapy may be useful for gene therapy of EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in immunocompromised patients </plain></SENT>
