<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its sensitivity is 85%, its specifity 96.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In specific clinical problems the number of pathological roentgen findings rises: from 34.4% when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> indications are taken into consideration to 58% in indications specific to the small intestine such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Morbus Crohn</z:hpo> or the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Search for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and the double contrast of the small bowel in unclear gastro-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002584'>intestinal bleeding</z:hpo> are unproductive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The weak point of this screening method is the lower part of the small intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the selective peroral or retrograde analysis of the terminal ileum supplement the contrast method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A precondition for good results is an adequate technical standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Besides the clinical results some technical results are therefore discussed such as contrast medium quantities, examination and X-ray time, radiation exposure and influences on the image quality </plain></SENT>
