<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that this susceptibility requires exposure of the anionic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> phosphatidylserine on the external face of the cell membrane, experiments were repeated with a human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Raji cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes or S49 mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, most of the Raji cells (83%) did not translocate phosphatidylserine to the cell surface upon treatment with ionomycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those few that did display exposed phosphatidylserine were hydrolyzed immediately upon addition of phospholipase A(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the remaining cells were also completely susceptible to the enzyme but were hydrolyzed at a slower rate and after a latency of about 100s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contradistinction to the defect in phosphatidylserine translocation, Raji cells did display other physical membrane changes upon ionomycin treatment that may be relevant to hydrolysis by phospholipase A(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These changes were detected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52129">merocyanine 540</z:chebi> and trimethylammonium <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51594">diphenylhexatriene</z:chebi> fluorescence and were common among <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes, S49 cells, and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of these latter effects corresponded well with the relative rates of hydrolysis among the three cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that while phosphatidylserine enhances the rate of cell membrane hydrolysis by secretory phospholipase A(2), it is not an absolute requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other physical properties such as membrane order contribute to the level of membrane susceptibility to the enzyme independent of phosphatidylserine </plain></SENT>
