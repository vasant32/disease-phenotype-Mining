<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marker studies of marrow blasts show an unusual and possibly unique pattern, in that an unequivocal monoclonal B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, having K-IgM with HLA-DR and B cell subset antigen (BA-1) expression, was superimposed with a mature suppressor T cell marker profile (pan-T, mature T, and suppressor/cytotoxic T antigens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The leukemic blasts were totally negative for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), human T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> virus (HTLV) p19 antigen, and other immunoglobulin isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis of marrow cells disclosed that 70% of the cells had 47,XY, + 12,t(8;14)(q24;q32) chromosome complement, and 30% of the cells had a 47,XY, + 12,dup1q + (q22-31),t(8;14)(q24;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The consistent finding of the specific chromosome rearrangement (8/14 translocation) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abnormal cells suggests that the cells were derived from a common precursor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With regard to the partial T cell marker expression, the significance of these markers in B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> is unclear, as is their relation to the additional chromosome abnormalities that apparently developed in the process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> </plain></SENT>
