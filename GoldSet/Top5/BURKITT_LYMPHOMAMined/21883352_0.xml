<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The B subunits (Stx1B) are cell-binding subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously established mouse hybridoma cell line producing IgA and IgG monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Stx1B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we cloned cDNAs encoding each of the heavy, light and joining (J) chains from the hybridoma cell lines by means of the 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon assignment of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains to known germline sequences, we found substantial somatic hypermutation in the complementarity-determining regions in both the IgA and IgG mAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also established a hybrid-IgG/IgA heavy chain having variable regions of the IgG mAb by means of recombinant PCR methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upon transient expression of the hybrid-IgG/IgA heavy, IgG-associated light and J chains in COS-1 cells, the translated dimeric hybrid-IgG/IgA bound to immobilized Stx1B, as revealed on ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The production of dimeric hybrid-IgG/IgA was revealed on immunoblot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dimeric hybrid-IgG/IgA inhibited the binding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi>-conjugated Stx1B to natural ligands (CD77) displayed on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Ramos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the replacement of variable regions resulted in the production of more useful recombinant dimeric IgA against Stx1B </plain></SENT>
