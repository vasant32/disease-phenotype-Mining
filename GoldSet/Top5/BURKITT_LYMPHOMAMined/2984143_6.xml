<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mode of action of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), we have examined the possibility that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> may lead to a change in oncogene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Levels of oncogene-related <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> were compared in the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>)-derived, EBV-negative cell line BJAB and in two isogenic, EBV-converted sublines of BJAB whose growth characteristics differ from the EBV-negative parent line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The oncogenes c-myc, Ha-ras, and Blym were each found to be expressed at equally high levels in the three cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the mechanism of action of EBV in altering the growth properties of lymphoid cells is not dependent on the induction of cellular oncogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, since the 8,14 chromosomal translocation has been related to increased c-myc expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, a karyotype analysis was done to confirm the initial report of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype in BJAB cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosomes 8 and 14 were seen to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, BJAB cells are a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line in which the elevated expression of c-myc is independent not only of EBV but also of translocations involving chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
