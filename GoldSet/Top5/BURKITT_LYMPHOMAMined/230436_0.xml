<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes and Raji cells revealed only traces of activity, significantly increased (p less than 0.001) collagenolytic activity was detected in samples of P3HR1, the cell-free EBV-suspension alone showed no collagenolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The described enzymatic activity was fully inhibited by 0-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="36417">phenanthroline</z:chebi> and EDTA indicating collagenase action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As main explanations for the phenomenon we suggest the possibility of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> enzyme induction, increased release of protease and thirdly that EBV carries a gene for synthesis of a collagenase </plain></SENT>
