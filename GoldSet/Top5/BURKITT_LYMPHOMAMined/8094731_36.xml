<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study confirms this finding by using a mAb specifically recognizing hsp60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This mAb can block outgrowth of human gamma delta T cells in response to stimulation with Daudi and in response to an extract of the mycobacteria H37Ra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This anti-hsp60 mAb stains the surface of Daudi cells, but does not stain either Raji or EBV-transformed B cells, cells which do not stimulate gamma delta T cell outgrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-hsp60 mAb could immunoprecipitate a 60-kDa molecule from the H37Ra extract but was unable to precipitate this 60-kDa molecule if the mAb was first absorbed on Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This mAb also precipitated a 60-kDa molecule from the surface of Daudi cells which shows an electrophoretic mobility pattern consistent with hsp60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These experiments demonstrate that human gamma delta T cells recognize hsp60-related <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on the surface of Daudi cells and within mycobacterial extracts </plain></SENT>
