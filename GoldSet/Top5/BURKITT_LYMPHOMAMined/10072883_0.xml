<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Two cases of primary nasopharyngeal Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in children were studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical features include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001742'>nasal obstruction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histology of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was confirmed by use of immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and double labelling techniques, the immunophenotype and EB virus locating sites were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The EB positive cells are B cells and represent 60%-95% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Nasopharyngeal primary Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is associated with EB virus in Chinese </plain></SENT>
