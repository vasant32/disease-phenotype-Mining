<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells the proto-oncogene c-myc is constantly juxtaposed through chromosomal translocation to one of the immunoglobulin loci on chromosomes 14, 2 or 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the majority of cases the chromosomal breakpoint is localized 3' or 5' of the gene leaving the physiological c-myc transcription unit intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of the translocation the c-myc gene on the translocation chromosome becomes transcriptionally activated in such a manner that the c-myc promoter P1 is more active than promoter P2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to define elements involved in c-myc activation through t(2;8) translocation we have studied the expression of constructs consisting of c-myc and different parts of the immunoglobulin kappa locus after stable transfection into Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The c-myc gene under the control of the complete Ig kappa locus containing matrix attachment region, intron enhancer, constant kappa gene and 3' enhancer was strongly activated with predominant usage of promoter P1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deletion analysis revealed that the intron or 3' enhancers alone activated c-myc to a much lesser extent and with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> promoter usage (P1 &lt; P2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cooperation of the same regulatory elements is required not only for transcriptional activation and induction of the promoter shift but also for down-regulation of promoter P1 of the translocated c-myc allele by <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, another characteristic feature of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This supports the notion that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> elements involved in transcriptional activation and dysregulation of c-myc are contained within the myc-Ig specific minichromosome </plain></SENT>
