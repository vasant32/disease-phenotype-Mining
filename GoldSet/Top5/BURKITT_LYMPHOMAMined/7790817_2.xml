<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The class II major histocompatibility complex genes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> contain in their proximal promoters three cis-elements called S, X, and Y that are conserved in both sequence and position, and a fourth element, J, conserved in sequence but not in position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>J, X, and Y and, to some extent, S, have been shown to be functionally important in regulation of expression of these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a protein factor that binds cooperatively to the S plus J elements of the promoter of the class II major histocompatibility complex gene <z:chebi fb="14" ids="39867,4640,53488">DPA</z:chebi> has been detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, functional cooperativity between S and J in activation of the enhancerless -40 interferon-beta (-40 IFN-beta) promoter has been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, the latter assay appears to subdivide complementation group A of class II negative human B cell lines that includes both mutants generated in vitro and cells from patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242583" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bare lymphocyte syndrome</z:e> (type II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three of these cell lines, the enhancerless -40 IFN-beta promoter containing the S plus J elements was functionally active, while in the others it was inactive </plain></SENT>
