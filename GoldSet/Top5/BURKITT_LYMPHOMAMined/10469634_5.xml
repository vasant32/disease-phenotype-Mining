<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxicity of the model DNA carboxymethylating agent azaserine was investigated in human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of the DNA repair enzyme O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) did not affect sensitivity to the drug in two related Raji Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA mismatch repair-defective variants of Raji cells which display increased tolerance to DNA methylation damage were not selectively resistant to azaserine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complementary results were obtained with a second carboxymethylating agent, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> diazoacetate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, lymphoblastoid cell lines representative of each of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043346" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">xeroderma pigmentosum</z:e> complementation groups, including the variant, were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly more sensitive to azaserine than nucleotide excision repair-proficient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hypersensitivity of XP cells was not due to systematic differences in the concentrations of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> compounds or related <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> metabolizing enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that of the two types of potentially lethal DNA damage which azaserine introduces, carboxymethylated bases and O(6)-methylguanine, the former are repaired by nucleotide excision repair and are a more significant contributor to azaserine <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> in human cells </plain></SENT>
