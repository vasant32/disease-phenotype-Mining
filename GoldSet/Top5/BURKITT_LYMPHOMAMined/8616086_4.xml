<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show that, in the first year after initiation of therapy, in 17/18 patients (10 patients were analysed after first diagnosis and nine patients after first BM relapse; one patient was analysed on both occasions) the percentage of CD10+ CD19+ cells and CD20- CD22+ cells in the CD34+ cell population indicated the likelihood of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A suppression of cells expressing these phenotypes after initiation of therapy was followed by an outgrowth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> precursor B cells after 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore this early test for impending relapse (which occurred 10-28 months after starting chemotherapy) was only applicable in the first year after beginning the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, despite this predictive value, comparison of fluorescence data with PCR results obtained from the same BM sample indicated that only a subpopulation of the CD34+ CD10+ CD19+ and CD34+ CD20- CD22+ cells above the determined threshold value represented malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A large prospective study to confirm the predictive value of this three-colour immunofluorescence assay is warranted </plain></SENT>
