<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The binding of four different <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 4Gal-specific antibodies was examined using several natural and synthetic <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 4Gal-containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> on thin-layer chromatograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the antibodies, MC2102, bound much better to galabiosylceramide (<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 4Gal beta Cer) than to the elongated structure globotriaosylceramide (<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 4Gal beta-4Glc beta Cer, CD77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two antibodies, 38.13 and Pk002, bound best to globotriaosylceramide but cross-reacted with the P1 antigen (<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 4Gal beta 3GlcNAc beta 3Gal beta 4Glc beta Cer) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fourth antibody tested, P001, reacted most strongly with the P1 antigen but also to some extent with globotriaosylceramide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the antibodies bound to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 4Gal placed internally in the carbohydrate chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The synthetic <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 4Gal beta-bissulfone (3-hexadecylsulfonyl-2-hexadecylsulfonylmethylprop-1-yl) was bound by MC2102, Pk002, and 38.13 with a strength comparable to <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 4Gal beta Cer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A large number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> lacking terminal <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 4Gal were also tested, but none of the antibodies bound to any of these structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the studied antibodies was used to investigate the presence of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 4Gal beta-containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> in several human and animal tissues and cells and in an experimental Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line grown in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">Glycolipids</z:chebi> were also isolated from a series of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and several of them were, by antibody binding, found to contain <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 4Gal beta Cer </plain></SENT>
