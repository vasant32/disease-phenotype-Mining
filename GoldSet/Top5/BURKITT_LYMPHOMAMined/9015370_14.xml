<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> (human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi>) gene, previously cloned in our laboratory, codes for a 12-kDa protein found in the culture supernatant of several hemopoietic human cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This protein is secreted by a nonclassical pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The role of the secreted enzyme as a signalling soluble mediator was demonstrated, but nothing is known about a membrane associated form of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> which could be involved in cell/cell contacts and accessory signal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we performed experiments to determine if human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> is also expressed at the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report here positive results based upon indirect immunofluorescence flow cytometric analysis of different human cell lines (HeLa, U 937, Jurkat, 3B6, Daudi and Raji) using a cross reactive sheep anti E. coli <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> polyclonal antibody demonstrating a significant expression of human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> at the surface of human cells </plain></SENT>
