<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This audit attempts to put forward the clinicopathological attributes and treatment outcomes of AYA NHL treated with both pediatric and adult protocols from a single centre in a developing country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Hospital records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive NHL patients registered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> clinic from January 2007 to May 2010 were reviewed for information on demography, clinical features, histology subtype, staging, treatment regimen, response rates, toxicities, and follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two-year progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated with Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AYA NHL constituted 4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell (DLBL) was the most frequent subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following were the 2-year PFS and OS - DLBL 64%, 76.9%, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>: 56%, 56%, lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>: 33.2%, 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results did not show any improvement in outcome of DLBL with the use of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> like regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights some of the key features of AYA NHL occurring in developing world </plain></SENT>
