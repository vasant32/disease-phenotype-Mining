<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In spite of the high toxicity, Stx1 has been proposed in the treatment of Gb3Cer/CD77-expressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell model expressing this receptor, namely Raji cells, that Stx1, at quasi-non-toxic concentrations (0.05-0.1 pM), inhibits the repair of mafosfamide-induced DNA alkylating lesions, synergistically potentiating the cytotoxic activity of the anticancer drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, human promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60, which do not express Gb3Cer/CD77, were spared by the toxin as previously demonstrated for CD34+ human progenitor cells, and hence, in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516211" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">cancer model</z:e>, no additive nor synergistic effects were observed with the combined Stx1/mafosfamide treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that Stx1 could be used to improve the mafosfamide-mediated purging of Gb3Cer/CD77+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells before autologous bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
