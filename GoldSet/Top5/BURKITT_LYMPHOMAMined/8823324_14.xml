<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the results of treatment for adult patients with Burkitt's and Burkitt-like non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) undergoing high-dose therapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT), and to determine prognostic factors for this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 117 adult patients reported to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> registry of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) between June 1984 and November 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy of these patients received high-dose therapy and stem-cell transplantation in first complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were reviewed, and prognostic factors were determined by univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The actuarial overall survival (OS) rate for the entire group was 53% at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major factor predicting for outcome after transplantation was disease status: the 3-year actuarial OS rate was 72% for patients transplanted in first CR, compared with 37% for patients in chemosensitive relapse, and 7% for chemoresistant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For patients transplanted in first CR, disease bulk at the time of ASCT was the only factor predictive of progression-free survival (PFS) and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of high-dose therapy and ASCT for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e>, particularly chemosensitive relapse, are superior to those reported for conventional-dose salvage regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results for patients transplanted in first CR require comparison with modern dose-intensive regimens </plain></SENT>
