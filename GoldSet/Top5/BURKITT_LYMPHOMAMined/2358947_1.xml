<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one children with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the head, neck, and maxillofacial region diagnosed between 1976 and 1988 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The age range was 2 to 17 years (median, 7.2 years), and 77.4% were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common presenting symptoms were detectable masses, floating and/or painful teeth, <z:mp ids='MP_0008542'>enlarged cervical lymph nodes</z:mp>, sore throat, and neurologic signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> sites were the jaws and tonsils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were staged by a clinical staging system, 17 of them having stage I-II, and 14 stage III-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase and ferritin were the only significant laboratory parameters correlating with initial staging and disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiologic features in the jaws were poorly circumscribed destructive lytic lesions with migration and crypt destruction of unerupted teeth buds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete disappearance of these findings was noted after successful chemotherapy and clinical regression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighteen (58.1%) patients attained complete remission with a follow-up of 5 to 100 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stage was the most significant variable affecting outcome, with 90.2% disease-free survival of stage I patients, 72.4% of stage II, and 18.2% of stage III-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, it is concluded that localized (stage I and II) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is responsive to chemotherapy and thus has a favorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
