<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty to fifty per cent of the lymphocytes were stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MP sera reacted also with 75%-100% of cells from two lymphoblastoid cell lines and one Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line and with about 80% of peripheral blood lymphocytes from one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_339'>lymphatic leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IFL reaction was negative with cells from leukaemic lymphoid T-cell line (Molt-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte fractionation experiments gave no evidence of a selective reactivity of MP sera and B or T lymphocytes of peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Removal of cold agglutinins from the MP sera by absorption with human O erythrocytes significantly reduced the IFL reactivity with lymphocytes and lymphoblastoid cells, indicating the presence of I antigen on these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, lymphoblastoid cells but not Molt lymphoid cells absorbed out most of the cold erythroagglutinins </plain></SENT>
