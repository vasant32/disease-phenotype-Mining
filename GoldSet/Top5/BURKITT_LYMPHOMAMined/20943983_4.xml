<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide a pipeline for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transcriptome analysis using <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-seq and we apply it to two type I latency cell lines, Mutu I and Akata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This analysis revealed substantial average expression levels of many lytic genes in predominantly latent cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lytic transcripts BHLF1 and LF3 were expressed at levels greater than those for 98% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cellular polyadenylated transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exon junction mapping accurately identified the Qp-derived EBNA1 splicing pattern, lytic gene splicing, and a complex splicing pattern within the BamHI A region </plain></SENT>
