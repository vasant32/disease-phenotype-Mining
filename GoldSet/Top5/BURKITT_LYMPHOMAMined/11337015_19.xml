<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>p73 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was not expressed in 19 (31.1%) of 61 ALL cell lines, including 11 (31.4%) of 35 B-precursor ALL cell lines, 2 (16.7%) of 12 B-ALL/Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines (totally 27.7% of B-lineage cell lines), 6 (42.9%) of 14 T-ALL cell lines, and expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Restriction-enzyme related PCR (REP) and methylation-specific PCR (MSP) revealed that the cell lines lacking p73 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were hypermethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes and most cell lines that expressed detectable p73 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were not hypermethylated with the exception of five cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> genomic sequencing confirmed the results obtained by REP and MSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that p73 inactivation may be involved in the pathogenesis of both T- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALLs</z:e>, and that hypermethylation is the predominant mechanism of inactivation of the p73 gene in ALL </plain></SENT>
