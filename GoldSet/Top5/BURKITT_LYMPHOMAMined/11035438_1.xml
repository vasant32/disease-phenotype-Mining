<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objectives were to provide estimates of the prevalence of autoantibody (Ab) directed to CD45 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients, identify the target autoantigen(s), and determine the ability of such reactivity to mediate neutralization of T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sera from 64 patients were studied using 2 assays: Western blot and an ELISA with CD45 eluted from 3 cell lines as antigen (U937, Jurkat and Daudi) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of carbohydrate specificity was investigated using enzyme digestion of blotted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi>, competition with <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi>, and inhibition with lectins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was studied through annexin V binding, and cell cycle analysis using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AutoAb to CD45 were detected in 16/64 sera (25%) by Western blot, and 21/32 sera (66%) found positive in the ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD45 purified from Daudi cells was identified in the ELISA, but not in the blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AutoAb were of the IgM and the IgG isotypes, but not specific for a particular cell type or CD45 isoform: 2 dominant specificities were recognized, one against p180, and another against high MW isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuraminidase-induced enhancement of reactivity, together with the inhibitory effect of N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28328">galactosamine</z:chebi> and Dolichos diflorus lectin suggest that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> are carbohydrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AutoAb which were specific for activated CD4+T cells triggered the annexin V binding, and, in 2 of 4 cases, lymphocytes underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, carbohydrate conformational <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> may be important as target antigens, and some CD45 autoAb have the capacity to neutralize activated T cells through anergy or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
