<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A factor, RF-S, was partially purified from human S phase cells based on its ability to activate DNA replication in extracts from G1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RF-S contained a human homologue of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe p34cdc2 kinase, and this kinase was necessary for RF-S activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The limiting step in activation of the p34 kinase at the G1 to S transition may be its association with a cyclin since addition of cyclin A to a G1 extract was sufficient to start DNA replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the role of p34cdc2 in controlling the start of DNA synthesis has been conserved in evolution </plain></SENT>
