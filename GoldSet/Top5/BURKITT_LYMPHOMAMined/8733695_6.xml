<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The therapy of choice for relapsed childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively compared the outcome of 57 patients who received autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with 17 patients who underwent allogeneic BMT for B cell lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> after at least one marrow relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The allogeneic BMT cohort included only those who would also have been eligible for autologous BMT had they not had a matched sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, patients who were not in complete remission, those with T cell positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, t(9;22) or those with only an extramedullary relapse were excluded from both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimens included total body irradiation and chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, white blood count at diagnosis, and duration of first and longest complete remissions were comparable for the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up of the event-free survivors was 4.8 years for those who received an autologous BMT (n = 26) and 4.6 years for those who received an allogeneic BMT (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relapse rate was higher in the autologous BMT group and the incidence of non-leukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> higher in the allogeneic BMT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival at 3 years was comparable for the two groups (47% +/- 7 vs 53% +/- 12, autologous vs allogeneic, respectively; P = 0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based upon these findings, we concluded that the outcome for autologous BMT was equivalent to allogeneic BMT for relapsed childhood B cell lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> in selected clinical situations </plain></SENT>
