<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The influence of time, temperature, and anti-metabolites on this process was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that when particles with an immunoligand are added to cells with a corresponding membrane receptor, three successive steps are initiated, the first two of which are not dependent on the temperature or the metabolic state of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first step in this process is the binding of particles to the cell surface through the immunoligand on the particle and the receptor on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial binding formed by immunoligand and corresponding receptor is followed by a stronger interaction between cell and particle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This second step seems to be governed by a successive antibody-antigen interaction: the zipper mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A third step in the particle-to-cell interaction is characterized by movements of the cellular surface, as revealed by membrane folds, pseudopods, and lamellae extending from the surface and enveloping large parts of the particle </plain></SENT>
