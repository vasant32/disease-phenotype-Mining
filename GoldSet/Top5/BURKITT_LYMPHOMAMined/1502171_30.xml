<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the major histocompatibility complex class II gene promoter DRA has previously identified at least five cis-acting regions required for maximal expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have examined the DRA promoter for protein-DNA interactions in the intact cell, which may mediate transcriptional activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using in vivo genomic footprinting we identified interactions in B-cell lines at the octamer site and the Y, X1, and X2 boxes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Class II antigen expressing T-cell lines maintained contacts identical to B-cell lines, while class II-negative T-cell lines exhibited no interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In lymphoid cell lines, the octamer site is occupied and required for maximal expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is most likely due to the presence of the lymphoid-specific OTF-2 factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the class II-positive nonlymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> cell line does not exhibit interactions at the octamer site despite the presence of the ubiquitous OTF-1 factor and an open binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the DRA promoter discriminates against OTF-1 activation at the level of DNA binding in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interferon gamma induces class II expression in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> cell line and, in parallel, up-regulates X1 and X2 box protein-DNA interactions, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other interactions remain unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that interferon gamma functions on a poised promoter by altering weak, nonproductive interactions at the X boxes to strong interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings provide direct in vivo evidence to strongly suggest that the modulation of X1 and X2 interactions is an important constituent of the interferon gamma induction pathway </plain></SENT>
