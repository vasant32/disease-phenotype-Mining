<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had almost complete removal of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, 16 had little over half of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> removed, and 43 underwent biopsy only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients subsequently received chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a highly significant difference in the proportion of patients achieving a sustained durable remission (P &gt; 0.0001) and a significant difference in survival (P &gt; 0.05) between the group having almost complete removal and the partial resection group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Partial resection gave no advantage over no surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We believe that whenever possible complete removal of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">abdominal tumour</z:e> should be attempted regardless of the presence of extra-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">abdominal tumour</z:e>; but unless at least 90% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> can be removed there is no advantage in partial resection in terms of response to subsequent chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular the removal of one of two involved ovaries can no longer be recommended </plain></SENT>
