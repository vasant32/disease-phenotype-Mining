<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequent activation of CD40, a membrane receptor of the nerve growth factor receptor superfamily, transits the B cells to the S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD40 may also act synergistically in combination with IL-4 (B lymphocytes) or IL-3/IL-7 (B-cell precursors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the proliferative responses of B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) cells to CD20/CD40 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 18/56 ALL cases, CD20 activation resulted in significant increases in DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar, although more moderate, effects were seen of activation of CD40 in 10/44 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responses to CD20 or CD40 activation were independent of co-stimulation with IL-3, IL-4 or IL-7, and various cocktails of the different growth stimuli did not act synergistically </plain></SENT>
