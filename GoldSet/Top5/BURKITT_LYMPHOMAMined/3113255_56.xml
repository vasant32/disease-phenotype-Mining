<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three well characterized B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, with diagnoses previously established by conventional cryostat immunocytochemistry or limited paraffin immunocytochemistry, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> encompassed most of the Kiel subtypes and included the newly recognized entity, sclerosing mediastinal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>. by the avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> peroxidase complex technique, each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was stained with a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies reactive in routinely fixed wax-embedded tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The panel included four reagents recognizing probable T-cell and B-cell restricted leukocyte common moieties (UCHL1, MT1, MB1, 4KB5), three antibodies to B-cell-related antigens (KiB3, MB2, LN1), and one to a macrophage-related antigen (Mac411) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other antibodies employed included anti-mu chain, anti-kappa, anti-lambda, and seven antibodies to non-phenotype-associated antigens, including HLA-DR (TAL-1B5, LN3, LN2, MB3), CD15 (C3D-1), and CD30 (BER-H2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monotypic surface or perinuclear space and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin were detected in 80% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Distinctive immunocytochemical profiles were demonstrable in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> categories by means of the panel of antibodies, thus facilitating the differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of similar <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results, together with our work on T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in paraffin sections, show that accurate phenotypic analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is now possible in routinely processed tissues </plain></SENT>
