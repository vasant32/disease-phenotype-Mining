<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first, the virus-producing cells were covered with human EBV antibody and subsequently passaged through anti-human-Ig columns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the second methods, untreated P3HR-1 cells were allowed to pass through columns of EBV receptor-positive cell lines or, as controls, EBV receptor-positive cell lines or, as controls, EBV receptor-negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of the VCA-positive cells were selectively removed by both techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second method involves the attachment of EBV-producer cells, known to accumulate <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> envelope material in their plasma membrane, to EBV receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In view of recent evidence indicating an association between EBV and complement receptors, human and mouse complement were tested for their ability to block this attachment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fresh mouse and human complement regularly exerted blocking activity, whereas heat-inactivated human serum did not block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heat-inactivated mouse serum did block occasionally, but the effect was more irregular than with fresh mouse serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Trypsin treatment of the EBV-receptor colum abolished its ability to retain VCA-positive cells </plain></SENT>
