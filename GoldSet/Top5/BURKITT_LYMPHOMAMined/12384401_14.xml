<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The B-cell receptor (BCR) for antigen is composed of surface immunoglobulin (sIg), which provides antigen specificity, and a noncovalently associated signaling unit, the CD79a/b heterodimer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defects in CD79 can influence both BCR expression and signaling and may explain why cells from certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, such as B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL), often express diminished and inactive BCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, an alternative transcript of CD79b (DeltaCD79b) has been reported that is up-regulated in B-CLL and may explain this diminished BCR expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we assess the expression of DeltaCD79b in B-CLL and other lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and investigate its function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High relative expression of DeltaCD79b was confirmed in most cases of B-CLL and found in 6 of 6 cases of splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with villous lymphocytes (SLVLs) and hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a range of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, expression of DeltaCD79b was relatively low but correlated inversely with the ability of the BCR to signal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> when cross-linked by antibody (Ab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, when Ramos-EHRB cells, which express low DeltaCD79b, were transfected with this transcript, they were transformed from being sensitive to anti-Fcmu-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> to being highly resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although DeltaCD79b was expressed as protein, its overexpression did not reduce the level of cell surface BCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we showed that the inhibitory activity of DeltaCD79b depended on an intact leader sequence to ensure endoplasmic reticulum (ER) trafficking and a functional signaling immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic tail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results point to DeltaCD79b being a powerful modulator of BCR signaling that may play an important role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
