<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its function is to protect cells from attack by homologous complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adsorption of purified HRF20 to Raji cells which have little, if any, of this factor increased their resistance to cytolysis by homologous complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the same cells treated with HRF20 remained sensitive to cytotoxic attack by IL-2 activated lymphocytes (lymphokine activated killer cells; LAK cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since LAK cells are effector cells which release perforin, HRF20 does not appear to protect cells from the damage caused by perforin </plain></SENT>
