<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two untreated childhood and adolescent B-NHL were enrolled in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of them 18 cases were Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 16 diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 8 anaplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 10 cases in stage II and 32 in stage III/IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were grouped by risk factors into low, medium and high risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with the B-NHL-BFM 90 (Berlin-Frankfurt- MÃ¼nster) protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The low risk group received A, B courses for 4 cycles, the medium risk group AA, BB courses for 6 cycles, and the high risk group AA, BB, CC courses for 6 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 37 patients (88%), and partial remission (PR) in 5 (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 5 PR patients, I received autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 3 received radiotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> and 1 just under watching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Major toxicity was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> and mucositis, especially in AA, BB and CC cycles, but was tolerant and manageable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 20 (4 - 89) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyse survival data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two year event free survival (EFS) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 86 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>24%, being 100% for stage II and 80.95% for stage III/IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Short term and intensive chemotherapy can improves the efficacy and survival rate of childhood and adolescent B-NHL, especially for advanced stage patients </plain></SENT>
