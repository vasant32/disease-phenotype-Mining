<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have called these complementary-strand transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They are also expressed in B cells, including Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and EBV-immortalized marmoset cell lines, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> generated in cottontop tamarins in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, but at a lower level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The complete structure of the major 4.8-kb <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (seven or eight exons) was determined in this study; the larger, but related, transcripts appear to be produced by differential splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The transcriptional promoter for the major complementary-strand transcripts, located in BamHI-I, contains several well-characterized transcriptional control elements (E2A, SP1, and AP1) and is functionally active in both B lymphocytes and epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It appears to be a bifunctional <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> promoter, as it also contains the initiation codon for a gene (BILF2) that encodes a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> that is expressed off the other strand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Splicing events create a number of small AUG-initiated open reading frames, one of which has homology to functionally significant regions of the EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 2 and to E2 (in papillomavirus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The complex nature of these transcripts and their potential role in the virus association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> are considered </plain></SENT>
