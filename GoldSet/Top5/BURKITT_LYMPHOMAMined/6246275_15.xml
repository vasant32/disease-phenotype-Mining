<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are three classes of virus-induced proteins; these are an early class, consisting of eight proteins synthesized by 6 h postinfection, an intermediate class, containing two proteins synthesized 9 h postinfection, and a late class, consisting of five proteins synthesized 12 h postinfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is a fourth class of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi>, called persistent, that are found both before and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rates of synthesis of the proteins fall into three patterns; these are pattern A, in which the rate of synthesis decreases, pattern B, in which the rate of synthesis remains steady, and pattern C, in which the rate of synthesis increases after the initial appearance of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
