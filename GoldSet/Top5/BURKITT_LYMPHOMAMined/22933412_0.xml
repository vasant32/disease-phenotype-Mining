<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported a series of synthetic anticancer heptapeptides (H-KKWβ(2,2) WKK-NH(2) ) containing a central achiral and lipophilic β(2,2) -amino acid that display low toxicity against non-malignant cells and high proteolytic stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have further investigated the effects of increasing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> and amphipathicity of two of our lead heptapeptides by preparing a series of seven to five residue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23449">cyclic peptides</z:chebi> containing the two most promising β(2,2) -amino acid derivatives as part of the central lipophilic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were tested for anticancer activity against human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Ramos cells), haemolytic activity against human red blood cells (RBC) and cytotoxicity against healthy human lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated a considerable increase in anticancer potency following head-to-tail <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> cyclization, especially for the shortest derivatives lacking a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32732">tryptophan residue</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-resolution NMR studies and molecular dynamics simulations together with an annexin-V-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> fluorescent assay showed that the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> had a membrane disruptive mode of action and that the more potent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> penetrated deeper into the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> bilayer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The need for new anticancer drugs with novel modes of action is demanding, and development of short cyclic anticancer <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> with an overall rigidified and amphipathic structure is a promising approach to new anticancer agents </plain></SENT>
