<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas individual inducers led to activation only in a limited number of cells, certain combinations of inducers greatly enlarged the reactive cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In synergistically acting combinations of drugs, the dose necessary for half-maximal induction of the first inducer was shifted to a much lower value by the second inducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum factor cooperated with any of the four inducers <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, IUdR, anti-IgM and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30772">n-butyric acid</z:chebi>, whereas <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> only interacted with IUdR and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30772">n-butyric acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of the serum factor and of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> showed some similarities but were not identical, whereas IUdR and n-BA showed identical effects </plain></SENT>
