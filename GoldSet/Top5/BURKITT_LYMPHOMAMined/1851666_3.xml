<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined the correlation between rearrangement and methylation status of the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain gene in 23 patients with B precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In B precursor ALL, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had a CCmeGG sequence in the C beta 2 region, a pattern similar to that observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mature B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Approximately 55% of patients with B precursor ALL exhibiting a hypomethylated CCGG sequence at the J beta 1 region showed rearrangement of this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the same allele of rearranged J beta 1 always contained an unmethylated sequence in the region, although another allele without rearrangement contained methylated J beta 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, none of the patients had a rearrangement in the J beta 1 region without hypomethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, rearrangement of the J beta 1 region may link to the hypomethylation status of this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A close association between hypomethylation of the J beta 1 region may promote accessibility to a putative common recombinase to produce TCR J beta 1 rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, about 45% of patients with a hypomethylated J beta 1 did not show rearrangement in this region, thus allowing categorization of B precursor ALL patients into subtypes, according to the combination of TCR beta-chain gene rearrangement and hypomethylation status, especially in the J beta 1 region </plain></SENT>
