<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proteins of the progeny virus were analysed for the presence of variant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, a few variant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One-dimensional <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> maps of the major virus protein p30 revealed no modifications after 25 cycles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> on the three cell lines studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> map of Pr65gag of virus grown through 25 passages on a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0006765'>chondrosarcoma</z:hpo> cell line was slightly different from that of the virus stock before passaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative amount of the virus protein p30 as compared to p18 and p16 (possibly the SSaV equivalents of p15E and p12E) was variable depending on the host cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Virus grown on Daudi cells was relatively deficient in p18 and p16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These virus particles were morphologically altered and had a low infectivity </plain></SENT>
