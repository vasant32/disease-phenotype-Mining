<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have generated hexavalent antibodies (HexAbs) comprising 6 Fabs tethered to one Fc of human IgG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three such constructs, 20-20, a monospecific HexAb comprising 6 Fabs of veltuzumab (humanized anti-CD20 immunoglobulin G1κ [IgG1κ]), 20-22, a bispecific HexAb comprising veltuzumab and 4 Fabs of epratuzumab (humanized anti-CD22 IgG1κ), and 22-20, a bispecific HexAb comprising epratuzumab and 4 Fabs of veltuzumab, were previously shown to inhibit pro-liferation of several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines at nanomolar concentrations in the absence of a crosslinking antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now report an in-depth analysis of the apoptotic and survival signals induced by the 3 HexAbs in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and provide in vitro cytotoxicity data for additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and also <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> patient specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the key findings are the significant increase in the levels of phosphorylated p38 and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 HexAbs and the notable differences in the signaling events triggered by the HexAbs from those incurred by crosslinking veltuzumab or rituximab with a secondary antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the greatly enhanced direct toxicity of these HexAbs correlates with their ability to alter the basal expression of various intracellular proteins involved in regulating cell growth, survival, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, with the net outcome leading to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
