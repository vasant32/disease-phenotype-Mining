<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we correlated the growth pattern with the clinical outcome of patients from whom the leukemic cells were derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> displayed three distinct growth patterns, ie, either aggressive, indolent, or no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leukemic cells from 6 of 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 4 of 7 T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>), and 11 of 16 patients with B-lineage ALL grew as subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, with a significant number subsequently disseminating into distant organs in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients whose leukemic blasts displayed an aggressive growth and dissemination pattern in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice had a relatively poor clinical outcome, whereas patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and T- or B-lineage ALL whose leukemic blasts grew indolently or whose cells failed to induce growth had a more favorable clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study has shown that the subcutaneous inoculation of patient-derived human leukemic cells in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice can engraft and grow as subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with subsequent dissemination to distant organs in a manner analogous to their pattern of growth in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, these data suggest a clinical correlation to the growth and dissemination of some leukemic subtypes that may represent not only an additional prognosticator for patient outcome, but also a vehicle for the study of the biologic behavior of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and the development of novel therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
