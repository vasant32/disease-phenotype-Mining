<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To delineate the cis-acting element through which EBNA-2 transactivates latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), we assayed the effect of EBNA-2 on the activity of LMP1 promoter upstream deletion mutants in the context of the LMP1 or heterologous promoters controlling <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene expression in Epstein-Barr virus-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Assays of progressive 5' deletions of the LMP1 promoter revealed low constitutive and at least eightfold EBNA-2-stimulated activity from -512 to +40 (-512/+40), -334/+40, and -234/+40 LMP1CAT plasmids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More extensive 5'-deleted -205/+40, -155/+40, and -147/+40 LMP1CAT plasmids also had low constitutive activity but were not EBNA-2 responsive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most 5'-deleted -55/+40 LMP1CAT plasmid had moderate constitutive activity and was not EBNA-2 inducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Either orientation of the -334/+40 LMP1 sequence conferred EBNA-2 responsiveness when positioned upstream of an enhancerless simian virus 40 or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase (TK) promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBNA-2 and the cis-acting LMP1 DNA were both required to increase TK promoter-initiated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, indicating that the EBNA-2 effect is at the transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further deletion analysis of the EBNA-2-responsive cis-acting element defined a -234/-92 LMP1 DNA fragment which conveyed EBNA-2 responsiveness to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus TK promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5' 30 bp between -234 and -205 were essential for EBNA-2 responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, these experiments define a 142-bp cis-acting element which is sufficient for conveying EBNA-2 responsiveness and an essential 30-bp component of that element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The role of this element in LMP1 and LMP2B expression and its possible role in LMP2A expression are discussed </plain></SENT>
