<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxicity of 5EtdUrd was investigated with seven established human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines as well as with human peripheral blood PHA-stimulated lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells were susceptible to the toxicity of 5EtdUrd as assayed with a [U-14C]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15603,30006">L-leucine</z:chebi> incorporation system developed for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 50% inhibition of leucine incorporation in 3-day cultures was induced by 1.3-3.8 microM 5EtdUrd with leukemic cells, but the concentration required to induce similar inhibition with PHA-stimulated lymphocytes was approximately was approximately 100-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The toxicity of 5EtdUrd seemed to require active DNA synthesis, since the inhibition of leucine incorporation became obvious only after the first 24 hours of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DNA incorporation studies were based on a new isotopically labeled 5EtdUrd derivative, [2-14C]5EtdUrd, synthesized for this study in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was demonstrated for the first time that most of the radioactivity derived from [2-14C]5EtdUrd in DNA was in 5-ethyluracil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>5EtdUrd has a powerful antileukemic potency in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Its effects against human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in vivo remain to be tested </plain></SENT>
