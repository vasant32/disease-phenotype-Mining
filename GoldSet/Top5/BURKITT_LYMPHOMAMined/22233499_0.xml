<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Repeated virological investigations on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biopsies proved negative, leading to the idea that a latent virus might be activated if <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells could be cultured, although no human lymphoid cell had at that time ever been maintained in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A chance event reminding of the need for suspension culture with mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> led to success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cultured cells carried a morphologically unequivocal, strangely inert, herpesvirus shown later to be immunologically, biologically and biochemically unique </plain></SENT>
