<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBNA-3C associates with the cellular DNA sequence-specific transcription factors RBP-Jkappa and PU.1 and coactivates the EBV LMP1 promoter with EBNA-2 in BL2 and Raji cells under conditions of restrictive growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now find that EBNA-3C is similar to EBNA-LP in coactivating the LMP1 promoter with EBNA-2 in non-EBV-infected Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells under conditions of maximal cell growth, whereas the EBV Cp promoter is repressed under the same conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBNA-3A and EBNA-3B coactivation are at most 40% that of EBNA-3C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The RBP-Jkappa binding sites of EBNA-2 and the LMP1 promoter are not required for EBNA-3C coactivation, whereas the PU.1 site in the LMP1 promoter is required for EBNA-2-mediated activation and EBNA-3C coactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBNA-3C amino acids (aa) 365 to 545, including most of the previously identified repression domain (M </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>EBNA-3C can also coactivate with the EBNA-2 acidic activating domain; this activation does not require aa 343 to 545 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that there are at least two mechanisms by which EBNA-3C coactivates the LMP1 promoter with EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Of the proteins that interact with EBNA-3C in a yeast two-hybrid screen, only the ubiquitin-like proteins SUMO-1 and SUMO-3/hSMT3B map to aa 365 to 545, implicating these molecules in EBNA-3C coactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In addition, SUMO-1 associates at a high level with EBNA-3C in lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Promoter coactivation by EBNA-3C is likely to be important in ensuring adequate levels of LMP1, while inhibition of the EBNA-Cp promoter under the same conditions prevents uncontrolled up-regulation of EBNA expression from a positive-feedback loop </plain></SENT>
