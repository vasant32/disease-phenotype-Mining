<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is endemic in the Equatorial Belt of Africa, its molecular hallmark is an activated, MYC gene mostly due to a chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Especially in its endemic clinical variant, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is associated with the oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and holoendemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> acts as an amplifier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Environmental factors may also cooperate in Burkitt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> in the endemic regions, such as plants used as traditional herbal remedies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Euphorbia tirucalli, a plant known to possess EBV-activating substances, has a similar geographical distribution to endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> and is used as a hedge, herbal remedy and toy in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> BeltI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we aimed at determining if exposure to Euphorbia tirucalli could contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, and at which extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lymphoblastoid and cord blood-derived cell lines were treated with plant extracts, and the expression of EBV-coded proteins was checked, to assess EBV reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of chromosomal translocations was then investigated by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary results suggest that E. tirucalli is able to reactivate EBV and determine chromosomal alterations, which leads to c-MYC altered expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The existence of genomic alterations might determine the accumulation of further genetic alteration, which could eventually lead to a transformed phenotype </plain></SENT>
