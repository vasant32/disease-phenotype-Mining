<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: We determined whether therapeutic responses using a bispecific antibody that pretargeted (90)Y-hapten-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> radioimmunotherapy or a directly radiolabeled, humanized, (90)Y-anti-CD20 IgG (veltuzumab) could be improved by combining these treatments with unlabeled humanized antibodies against CD22 (epratuzumab), CD74 (milatuzumab), or veltuzumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>Nude</z:mp> mice bearing established subcutaneous Ramos human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated with antibodies alone or in combination with pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PT-RAIT) or radioimmunotherapy, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> was monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biodistribution studies examined the effect that predosing with unlabeled veltuzumab had on radioimmunotherapy and PT-RAIT targeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the unconjugated antibodies was effective against established and rapidly growing xenografts, but PT-RAIT, at approximately 30% of its maximum tolerated dose, and radioimmunotherapy alone, at its maximum tolerated dose, were able to arrest growth and even entirely ablate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in some animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only combinations with veltuzumab improved therapeutic responses, most significantly when a veltuzumab regimen (weekly, 1.0 mg followed by 3 x 0.5 mg) was initiated 1 wk after PT-RAIT or (90)Y-veltuzumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biodistribution data indicated that when unlabeled veltuzumab (1.0 or 0.25 mg) was administered in advance of the radiolabeled veltuzumab or bispecific antibody injection, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> uptake was significantly reduced ((111)In-veltuzumab, 47% and 25%, respectively; (111)In-hapten-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, 74% and 49%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite an approximately 50% decrease in radioactivity uptake in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, antitumor responses were not diminished significantly for (90)Y-veltuzumab, and in the case of PT-RAIT responses were improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, higher amounts of predosed veltuzumab reduced the effects of PT-RAIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These studies suggest that administering unlabeled anti-CD20 IgG therapy after the radioactivity dose provides the best efficacy and that the amount of unlabeled anti-CD20 IgG administered as a predose to anti-CD20-targeted radionuclide therapy should be minimized </plain></SENT>
