<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate the non-neoplastic nature of lymphoblastoid cell lines in spite of their high proliferative activity in vitro and their <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> after long-term cultivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cell lines of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> origin apparently are truly malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, characterized by <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and by the presence of a 14q+-marker chromosome even in the EBV-negative cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 14q+-marker chromosome, observed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as well as in other malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, seems to be related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, independent on the presence of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The significance of the <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> for the differentiation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphoblastoid cell lines is discussed </plain></SENT>
