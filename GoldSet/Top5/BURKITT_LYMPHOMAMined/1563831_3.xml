<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the expression of c-myc and 2 other members of the myc gene family, L- and N-myc, at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein level, and analyzed for possible rearrangements of these genes in the human counterpart to the mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo>--<z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine well-characterized MM cell lines were examined by using Northern- and Southern-blot analysis and immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The c-myc gene was found to be highly expressed in most MM cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of expression was comparable to that observed in the COLO 320 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cell lines, carrying amplified c-myc genes, and to that of B-cell lines with a higher proliferative activity than the MM cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the U-266 MM cell line, L-myc, but no c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> or protein, was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The L-myc gene was expressed in both early- and late-passage U-266 cells, suggesting that the L-myc expression was not the result of the in vitro cultivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>N-myc was not expressed in any of the MM cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No rearrangements of c-myc or L-myc genes were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We thus conclude that (a) in contrast to the corresponding mouse and rat B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, c-myc is not frequently rearranged in MM; (b) c-myc is highly expressed in most MM lines; and (c) L-myc but not c-myc is expressed in the U-266 MM cell line </plain></SENT>
