<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have characterized two of these antibodies by screening on haematopoietic cell lines, and frozen sections of both reactive and neoplastic lymphoid tissue, and found reactivity with separate cellular components of lymphoid follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal FW37.4.D5 reacts in section specifically with follicular dendritic reticular cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal 35.1C5 reacts with a subpopulation of splenic marginal zone, and lymph node mantle zone, B lymphocytes, but stains only rare cells within germinal centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This monoclonal is operationally B lymphocyte specific, distinguishing an 'intermediate' B cell subset, represented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by B <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, B hairy cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and centrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
