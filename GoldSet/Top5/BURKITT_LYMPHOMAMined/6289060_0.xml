<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In virus-producing cells no significant differences in the molecular weight of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>-methionine-labeled EBV-associated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> patterns could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis 125I-labeled <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> from purified virus particles of four different strains revealed that, in addition to common <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi>, individual EBV strains contain strain-specific high molecular weight glycopolypeptides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi>, constituting part of the membrane antigen complex, are present in varying amounts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While P3HR-1 virus particles contain a major component of 250 000 and small amounts of 340 000 molecular weight <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi>, Q IMR-WIL virus particles have more 340 00 than 240 000 molecular weight <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in B95-8 particles and in particles from an EBV strain isolated from an African green monkey (AGM-EBV) respectively, large amounts of 360 000 and 250 000 polypeptides could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since these glycopolypeptides carry strain-, subgroup- and group-specific antigenic determinants, also found in virus strains produced in human and marmoset cells, it should be further investigated whether these differences in molecular weight are virus-strain- or cell-specific </plain></SENT>
