<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Representation of the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was verified by demonstration of (1) identical biallelic rearrangement of Ig genes for 2F7 and (2) shared idiotype for 10C9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both cell lines displayed cell-surface Ig and secreted Ig (IgM lambda for 2F7, IgM kappa for 10C9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgMs from both cell lines immunoprecipitated actin; in addition, 2F7 IgM lambda immunoprecipitated recombinant human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp 160 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2F7 IgM lambda did not react with other autoantigens (double-stranded and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi>, actin, bovine serum albumin, IgG), whereas 10C9 IgM kappa reacted with human IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2F7 IgM heavy-chain variable region (VH) showed a 95% nucleotide homology with a previously sequenced VHIII germline gene, hv3019b9, whereas the 10C9 IgM VH showed a 95% homology with a previously sequenced VHIV germline gene, VH4.21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Use of minimally modified VH genes and demonstration of reactivity with chronically present antigens (ie, actin, HIV-1 gp 160, or human IgG) suggests that B cells in HIV-1-infected individuals proliferating in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> antigenic stimulation may be at increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
