<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Each case was reclassified according to the Working Formulation and an attempt made to allocate an immunophenotype using a panel of monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were correlated with clinical data on site and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 43 cases, 30 were males and 13 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 17 cases of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 15 cases of small non-cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (SNCC), and four cases of large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SNCC group was subdivided into 10 cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and five cases of non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An immunophenotype was allocated in 65.1% of cases (23 B, 5 T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SNCC cases were spread throughout the 0-16 year age range while the lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases tended to occur in older children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025063" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mediastinal tumours</z:e> were lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">abdominal tumours</z:e> were SNCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis failed to show a significant difference in survival among histological subgroups or immunophenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No histological variables of prognostic importance were identified partly due to the great variation in treatment regimens, standard of supportive care, and prognosis over the period of the study (1972 to 1988) </plain></SENT>
