<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dialysis, a well as Sephadex G-200 gel filtration of AB serum revealed that the immunoglobulin containing fraction was the responsible factor for the increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results suggest the involvement of antibodies in NCMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autologous and allogeneic serum of patients with gynecological <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> inhibited (10-64%) and/or stimulated (10-250%) the NCMC activity in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Residual NCMC activity exceeding 20% has been present after the trypsin digestion in serum free medium of effector lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar 20% residual activity has been observed after the addition of anti-immunglobulin and antigen-antibody complexes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggested the role of antibodies and serum factors in natural killer activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless other mechanisms resistant to trypsin treatment and of a certain specificity to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells may not be excluded </plain></SENT>
