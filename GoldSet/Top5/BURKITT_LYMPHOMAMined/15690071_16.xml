<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrated that Bcl-2 was constitutively phosphorylated in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumor</z:e> cell lines and in primary ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased phosphorylation of Bcl-2 protein in the JM1 ALL cell line, achieved by expression of the phosphomimetic Bcl-2 construct S70E, enhanced JM1 cell chemoresistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, initiation of JM1 cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was coincident with dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 and elevated protein phosphatase 2A activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>S70E expression also diminished tBid-mediated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release and blunted chemotherapy-induced activation of caspases-9 and -3 in JM1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine whether soluble factors produced by stromal cells in the bone marrow influence phosphorylation of Bcl-2 protein, a panel of recombinant cytokines was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of those tested, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 protein and blunted <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release during chemotherapy or tBid treatment of ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, JM1 cells transfected with S70A, resulting in expression of Bcl-2 protein that cannot be phosphorylated, were not efficiently rescued from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that optimal protection of leukemic cells by VEGF may require activation of a pathway that includes Bcl-2 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
