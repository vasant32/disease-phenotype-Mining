<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CULTURES WERE INITIATED WITH PERIPHERAL LEUKOCYTES FROM INDIVIDUALS: (i) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (IM); (ii) with past histories of IM; and (iii) without histories of IM and without antibodies to EB virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In confirmation of other reports, the first group of cultures developed readily and rapidly into lines of blastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cellular replication commenced in 24 of 25 attempts within 17 to 28 days, regardless of the technique employed; i.e., initial seeding of the leukocytes with or without addition of phytohemagglutinin onto monolayers of human diploid cells (WI-38) or direct establishment of suspension cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBV was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cultures by immunofluorescence and also by electron microscopy when tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the nine cultures which were examined cytogenetically revealed the C-group (#10) chromosomal marker previously found in cultured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings supported the earlier conclusion that EBV is related to, if not identical with, the causative agent of IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cultures of the second group commenced growth only within 30 to 60 days in five of seven attempts, depending apparently upon the early presence of WI-38 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cultures also revealed the presence of EBV and, in the three examined, the C-group chromosomal marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Leukocytes of the third group, seeded onto WI-38 monolayers, failed to become established in four attempts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The possible implications of these findings are discussed </plain></SENT>
