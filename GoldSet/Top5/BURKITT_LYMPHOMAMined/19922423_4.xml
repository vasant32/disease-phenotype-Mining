<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alleles of the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) -A2 family are dominantly expressed in Caucasians so we sought to identify EBNA1-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses restricted through this allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on the characterization of the LQTHIFAEV (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e>) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e>-specific memory CTL responses were reactivated in three of 14 healthy EBV seropositive donors (21%) whereas responses to HLA-A2-restricted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi>, two derived from LMP2 and one from EBNA3A, were detected in 93%, 71% and 42% of the donors, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e>-specific CTL clones did not lyse EBV-carrying lymphoblastoid cell lines and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines nor EBNA1-transfected Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells but specifically released interferon-gamma upon stimulation with HLA-matched EBNA1-expressing cells and this response was enhanced by deletion of the Gly-Ala repeat domain that inhibits proteasomal degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The poor presentation of the endogenously expressed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> was not affected by inhibition of peptidases that trim antigenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in the cytosol but full presentation was achieved in cells expressing a trojan antigen construct that releases the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> directly into the endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence, inefficient proteasomal processing appears to be mainly responsible for the poor presentation of this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
