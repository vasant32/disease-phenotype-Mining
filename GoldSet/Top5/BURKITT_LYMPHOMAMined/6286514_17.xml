<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>38-13 is a hybridoma-produced monoclonal rat IgM which appears to define a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated antigen (BLA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we described the reactivity of 38-13 with a panel of human haematopoietic and lymphoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In indirect immunofluorescence (IF) assays, 15 of 26 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) lines studied were clearly stained with 38-13 (from 13 to 100% positive cells) by microscope, with varying numbers of heavily labelled cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these positive cell lines, fluorescence-activated cell-sorter (FACS) analysis demonstrated that BLA was actually present on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> included Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome-carrying lines and EBV-negative ones; thus, BLA is not related to the presence of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the 15 BL cells that reacted with 38-13 contained a typical t(8;14) translocation, but had variant translocations such as t(2;8) and t(8;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cells were derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients of different geographical origins and clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines were poorly stained and seven were negative with 38-13 in IF assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 32 EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell-lines (LCL) studied were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In three line pairs, consisting of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> line and an LCL from the same patient, only the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line was demonstrated to react with 38-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A series of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, including haematopoietic, lymphoid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> lines, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> failed to react with 38-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Various attempts to modulate the expression of BLA on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells were unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, it cannot be ruled out that BLA is actually a transient B-cell differentiation marker </plain></SENT>
