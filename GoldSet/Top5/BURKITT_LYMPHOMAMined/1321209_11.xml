<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that both EBERs are expressed in the major EBV-carrying cell types, group I and III Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and in two <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse-passaged nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relative amount of EBER 1 and EBER 2 varied in different host cells but did not correlate with the <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EBER coding and flanking sequences were predominantly hypomethylated at HpaII sites not only in LCLs which usually carry hypomethylated EBV genomes but also in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and NPC cell lines harbouring EBV episomes that are highly methylated in other regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the EBER transcription units, actively transcribed by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase III in the major EBV-carrying cell types, represent a methylation-free region in the EBV genome similarly to regulatory sequences of the latent membrane protein gene when the latter is transcribed by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase II </plain></SENT>
