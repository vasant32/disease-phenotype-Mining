<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that an anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody (MAb; HD37) inhibits the function of the P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (P-gp) pump in a multidrug-resistant (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>) B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Namalwa/MDR1, and that this effect is not due to the recognition of a cross-reactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> on P-gp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have used the same cell line to define the mechanisms responsible for the effect of HD37 on the P-gp pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we show that CD19 and P-gp are constitutively associated in cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the absence of treatment with anti-CD19, 40% of P-gp molecules expressed by Namalwa/MDR1 cells reside in the low-density <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> (ie, cholesterol-rich) microdomains (<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following treatment of the cells with HD37 and disruption of the interactions between P-gp and CD19, P-gp translocated out of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts and CD19 translocated into <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of chemosensitization on Namalwa/MDR1 cells was specific for CD19; an anti-CD22 MAb had no such effect, although the cells express CD22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that anti-CD19 might chemosensitize P-gp(+) cells by interfering with interactions between CD19 and P-gp, rapidly resulting in the translocation of P-gp into a compartment on the plasma membrane where it is no longer active </plain></SENT>
