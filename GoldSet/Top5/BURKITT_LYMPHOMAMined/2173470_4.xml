<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two patients treated with TF and 2 controls relapsed early (less than or equal to 12 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two out of 12 TF-treated patients and 5 out of 11 controls subsequently suffered relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time to first late relapse was longer among TF-treated patients (p = 0.08), and no late relapse occurred while a patient was receiving TF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus it seems that specific TF might be useful in the management of endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and also in the treatment of other virus-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and diseases </plain></SENT>
