<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic rate of Daudi cells treated with PHI was measured by flow cytometry, the changes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 and H4 acetylation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3K9 and H3K4 methylation in Daudi cells treated with PHI were detected by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that PHI could induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Daudi cells, increased the acetylation level of H3 and H4, enhanced the methylation of H3K4, but reduced the methylation of H3K9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the PHI can up-regulate the acetylation level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 associated with transcription stimulation and the methylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3K4, down-regulate the methylation on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3K9 associated with transcription inhibition, promotes the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PHI may be a potential agent for target therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
