<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The relationship between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e>, pharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Further relationship seems to exist between EBV and the lymphoproliferative syndromes appearing in immunodeficient subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present work is aimed to study the possible relationship between the virus and the lymphoproliferative syndromes presented by people without any apparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The presence of antibodies against different antigens of the virus was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibodies against the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen were studied along with those against the early antigen and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> core antigen in 55 patients with lymphoproliferative syndromes, of whom 38 had non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 17 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, and none of them had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly higher geometric means of the titres against capsid antigen and of the prevalence of antibodies against early antigen were seen in the patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with respect to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> showed lower immunologic response than the control group, although the difference was not significant for any of the antibodies under study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The higher immunologic response against EBV and its reactivation in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> would suggest that such agent could play a role favouring the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease, if not as a direct aetiological factor </plain></SENT>
