<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both sequence-specific and nonspecific mechanisms have been elaborated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have presented evidence that methylation-associated inhibition of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) major latency promoter (BamHI C promoter or Cp) in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> may play an important role in the pathogenesis of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> by protecting them from CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell immunosurveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of transcriptional repression may relate to specific inhibition of the binding of a cellular transcription factor by methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To dissect the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> promoter with regard to transcriptional sensitivity to methylation, we have devised an assay that allows the methylation of discrete regions of reporter plasmids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the course of the assay, methylation patterns appeared to be stable; there was no evidence of either spread or reversal of the imposed methylation pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Application of the assay to the 3.8-kb region upstream of the major EBV latency promoter with natural Cp reporter plasmids showed that sensitivity to methylation is not homogeneously distributed but is concentrated in two discrete regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The first of these methylation-hypersensitive regions (MHRI) is the previously identified EBNA-2 response element, which includes the methylation-sensitive CBF2 binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second (MHRII) is a sequence further downstream whose potential role in methylation-mediated transcriptional repression had been previously unsuspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In chimeric enhancer/promoter plasmids, methylation of this downstream region was sufficient to virtually abolish simian virus 40 enhancer-driven transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further dissection indicated that methylation of the EBNA-2 response element (MHRI) was sufficient to abolish EBNA-2-mediated Cp activity while methylation of a region including the EBNA-2 response element and downstream sequence (MHRI and MHRII) was sufficient to abolish <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Cp-mediated reporter activity, including that driven by the EBNA-1-dependent enhancer in the origin of plasmid replication, oriP </plain></SENT>
