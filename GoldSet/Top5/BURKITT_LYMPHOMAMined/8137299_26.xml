<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this work, the expression of the BARF1 gene was studied in the human Louckes B-lymphocyte cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Introduction of the BARF1 open reading frame under the control of the Mo-MuLV LTR promotor into nontumorigenic Louckes lymphoid cells led to the activation of the c-myc protooncogene and increased expression of the B-cell surface proteins, the transferrin receptor, CD21, and CD23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BARF1-expressing cells induced a diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in newborn rats treated with anti-thymocyte serum that was, however, transient and regressed after 3-4 weeks as the immune system recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> induction was similar to that observed with lymphoid cell lines in vitro generated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with the B95-8 virus strain, in which lytic antigens are expressed at low levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After long-term culture, Louckes cell clones lost expression of the BARF1 gene and were unable to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
