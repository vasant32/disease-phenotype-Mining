<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to treat patients with B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with radioimmunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies (mAb) such as CD19, CD20 and CD22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the rate of internalization and catabolism of these mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 24 h at 37 degrees C, 20%-25% of initially cell-bound (125)I-CD19 mAb and (125)I-CD22 mAb was degraded in B cells, whereas almost no degredation occurred after binding of (125)I-CD20 mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For B cells expressing Fcgamma receptor II (FcgammaRII), isotype-dependent degradation was noted as the CD19 IgGl mAb showed an enhanced degradation rate compared to the switch variant IgG2a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of various pharmaceutical agents that delay the internalization or subsequent degradation of mAb was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degradation was inhibited most effectively by a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and vinblastine, resulting in accumulation of radioactivity in the target cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also the simultaneous application of CD20 or CD22 with (125)I-CD19 mAb or of CD20 with (125)I-CD22 mAb proved to be a potent inhibitor of the rapid degradation of these mAb, by inhibiting internalization via an FcgammaRII-mediated mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both methods of reducing the degradation of radioiodinated mAb are expected to prolong irradiation of malignant b cells and consequently result in an enhanced therapeutic effect in vivo </plain></SENT>
