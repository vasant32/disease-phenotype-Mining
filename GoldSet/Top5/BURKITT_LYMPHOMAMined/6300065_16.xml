<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) is speculated to be involved in cell transformation by the virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies on the molecular properties of EBNA, however, have yielded conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, three Epstein-Barr virus(EBV)-induced antigens were isolated and purified from extracts prepared from Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These antigens were able to block the anticomplement immunofluorescence reaction, indicating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three were related to EBNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The soluble antigen was found wholly in the cytosol fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An EBV-induced nuclear antigen I was found both in the cytosol and the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EBV-induced nuclear antigen II was found associated with the chromatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The soluble antigen and the nuclear antigen I were separated and partially purified using phosphocellulose chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each was further purified 1,400-fold with respect to the whole cell state by chromatography on CL-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> 6B followed by blue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi>. subunit molecular weights of 70,000 were determined for each of these antigens, both in the crude and purified state, by radioimmunoelectrophoresis and gel filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The nuclear antigen II was purified 2,500-fold using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52255">hydroxylapatite</z:chebi>, CL-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> 6B, and blue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> chromatographies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This antigen displayed two subunits by radioimmunoelectrophoresis with molecular weights of 65,000 and 70,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> antigens shared similar molecular weights, the extent of their homology remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
