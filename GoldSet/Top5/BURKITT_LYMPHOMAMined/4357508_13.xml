<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This restriction is characterized by a low proportion of cells yielding infectious virus and is associated with limited production of 42S virion <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary transcription of 13S and 26S VSV-specific <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> is not restricted in Raji cells, and the 13S <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> produced contains adenylate-rich sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the block in Raji cells involves some step required for the replication of virion <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
