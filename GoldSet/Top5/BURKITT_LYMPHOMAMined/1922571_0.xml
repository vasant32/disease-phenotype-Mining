<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>P3HR-1 cell line derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was chosen as a model for studying the development of the cell population during long-term cultivation from the cytogenetic point of view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty G-banded karyotypes at two different passage levels were analyzed, using also C-, Q- and Ag-staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The modal chromosomal number at the 15th passage was 49, at the 75th passage 48 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the 15th passage considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of karyotypes was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only four metaphases had an identical karyotype: 49, XY, +7, +21, +psu dic mar, dup(1) (q21q42), del(1) (p ter----q23:), t(8;14) (q24;q32), 16qh+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This clone turned out to be important in the further development of the cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the 75th passage there was only one metaphase with this karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen metaphases (30%) revealed a karyotype with only one difference from the karyotype mentioned above: deletion of a part of the short arm of one chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further 16 metaphases (32%) had 48 chromosomes, where one chromosome 7 was missing in comparison with the above mentioned karyotype, and 3 metaphases (6%) with 48 chromosomes, where the loss of chromosome 21 and deletion of a part of the short arm of one chromosome 7 were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These three clones could have originated from the clone described at the 15th passage through loss of a whole or part of chromosome, or both; i.e. the clone forming 8% of the cell population at the 15th passage gave rise to 70% of the cell population during 60 passages in vitro (30 weeks of cultivation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis at two different passages enables the observation of the dynamic changes in the cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A wide gamut of cell clones enables heterogenous selection influences in vitro </plain></SENT>
