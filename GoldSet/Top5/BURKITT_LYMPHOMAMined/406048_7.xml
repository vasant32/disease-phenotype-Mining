<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Double-antibody radioimmunoassays were established for kappa and lambda light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulins were detergent-extrated by <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100 and quantified by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Raji parent expressed small amounts of kappa chains on its surface, and the Namalwa parent a 10 fold greater amount of lambda chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that the majority of the hybrid clones co-express both parental phenotypes </plain></SENT>
