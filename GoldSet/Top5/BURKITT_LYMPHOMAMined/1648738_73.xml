<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) expresses six nuclear antigens (EBNAs) and three integral latent membrane proteins (LMPs) in latently infected growth-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, EBV protein expression in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue or in newly established Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines is frequently restricted to the EBV genome maintenance protein, EBNA-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBNA-1 expression in the absence of other EBNAs and LMP-1 has been an enigma since, in LCLs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBNA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> are processed from a single transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now show that the basis for restricted EBV expression in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells is selective EBNA-1 mRNA transcription from a hitherto unrecognized promoter that is 50 kb closer to the EBNA-1-encoding exon than previously described EBNA-1 promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infected cells with EBNA-1-restricted expression could preferentially persist in vivo in the face of EBV-immune T-cell responses, which are frequently directed against other EBNAs and are also dependent on LMP-1 expression </plain></SENT>
