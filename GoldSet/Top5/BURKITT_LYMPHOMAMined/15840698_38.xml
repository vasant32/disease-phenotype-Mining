<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterpart of the neoplastic B cells in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies, some authors suggest an origin from germinal center cells and others from memory B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, most of these studies rely on cell lines or on a small series of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To help clarify the cell of origin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify the VDJ rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (V(H)) genes, and the resultant amplificates were sequenced for comparison with known germline V(H) segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of this approach revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases (15 endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> [eBL], 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> [sBL], and 6 AIDS-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) harbor mutated V(H) genes, with different mutation ranges among the 3 types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The eBL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related forms showed considerably higher mutation rates than the sBL form (5.1%, 5.4%, and 1.5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutations in eBL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> also showed signs of antigen selection, whereas no signs of antigen selection were found in sBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, after subcloning the amplificates, sequence analysis revealed no signs of ongoing mutations in any of the cases analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given that one of the main differences between eBL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> on the one hand and sBL on the other hand is the association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), we compared EBV-positive and EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> independently of their geographic origin and HIV status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The differences in the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> and antigen selection were even more evident when this approach was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>According to our molecular results, it appears that EBV-positive and EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> may originate from 2 distinct subsets of B cells, pointing to a particular role for the germinal-center reaction in the pathogenesis of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The different types of C-MYC translocation reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> may also be related to the different stages of B-cell maturation </plain></SENT>
