<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We screened for immunoglobulin (Ig) production stimulating factor (IPSF) which enhanced Ig production of human-to-human hybridomas in serum-free culture, and found that culture supernatant and lysate of human lymphoblastoid Namalwa cells stimulated proliferation and Ig production of human-to-human hybridoma HB4C5 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IPSF in Namalwa lysate was partially purified with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi>-Toyopearl 650M, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52255">hydroxylapatite</z:chebi> and Superose 6HR 10/30 column chromatographies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The partially purified IPSF was a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="33839">macromolecule</z:chebi> of about 500,000 dalton containing 72,000 dalton protein as a major component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activity was stable at pH 6 to 12, but inactivated partially by heating over 40 degrees C (60% decrease) and completely by trypsin digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the IPSF activity is due to its protein and heat-stable components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Namalwa IPSF stimulated proliferation of human-to-human hybridomas but not that of mouse-to-mouse hybridomas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IPSF also stimulated Ig production of human-to-human hybridomas derived from NAT-30 cells, but not that of other human-to-human or mouse-to-mouse hybridomas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NAT-30 is a human fusion partner derived from Namalwa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the Namalwa IPSF is an autocrine factor that stimulates proliferation and Ig production of hybridomas derived from NAT-30 cells </plain></SENT>
