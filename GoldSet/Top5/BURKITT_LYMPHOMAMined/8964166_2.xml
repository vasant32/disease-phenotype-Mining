<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenetic role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is of interest due to its established role in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> in immunosuppressed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three cases of histologically confirmed PCNSL with corresponding cytology were identified, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> obtained under stereotactic guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients were human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) positive, two were HIV negative, and one was of unknown status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Papanicolaou-stained slides were selected from each case and evaluated for the presence of EBV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> via in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) utilizing a biotinylated probe specific for EBER 1 RNA, and detected by a conventional streptavidin-peroxidase system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cases included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> (12), large cell (10), and mixed small and large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The predominant immunophenotype was B-cell (19), although T-cell (2) and biphenotypic (1) cases were also identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> showed nuclear positivity for EBV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in 19 of 23 cases (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the presence of EBV in PCNSL in immunosuppressed patients and implies a potential etiologic role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ability to demonstrate EBV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in cytologic preparations by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> also raises the possibility of early identification of high-risk patients through detection of EBV-infected lymphocytes in CSF specimens </plain></SENT>
