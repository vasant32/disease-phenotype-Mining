<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>B-cell antigen receptor signaling is initiated upon binding of the antigen to membrane-bound immunoblobulin (Ig), and the anti-Ig antibody (Ab) mimics this signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In B cells latently infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the same signals induce virus activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examine here whether rheumatoid factors (RFs), autoantibodies directed against the Fc portion of IgG, induce EBV and B-cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a source of RFs, RF-producing lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) clones were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and synovial cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) by EBV transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived Akata cells, which are highly responsive to EBV activation by anti-Ig Abs, were used for the assay of EBV activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Akata cells expressed IgG3 as membrane-bound Ig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RFs from a synovium-derived LCL were directed to IgG3 and induced EBV activation in 16 to 18% of Akata cells, whereas RFs from another synovium-derived LCL were directed to IgG1 and did not induce EBV activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of RFs with the purified Fc fragment of human IgG completely abolished EBV activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, B-cell activation was assessed by incorporation of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RFs from synovium-derived LCLs efficiently induced B-cell activation, and the addition of CD40 ligand had a synergistic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, RFs from PBMC-derived LCLs were polyreactive, had a lower affinity to IgG, and did not induce EBV and B-cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present findings imply a possible role for RFs as EBV and B-cell activators </plain></SENT>
