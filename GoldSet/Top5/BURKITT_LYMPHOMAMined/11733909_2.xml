<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records of children who were treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039590" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">testicular tumor</z:e> in our unit from 1970 to 1999, inclusive, were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information recorded for each patient included age, sex, past medical history, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatment methods, histopathologic findings, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-one patients with a mean age of 3.8 +/- 0.5 years were treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039590" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">testicular tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 35 (69%) had germ cell <z:mp ids='MP_0006262'>testis tumor</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>) and 16 (31%) had non-germ cell <z:mp ids='MP_0006262'>testis tumor</z:mp> (NGCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_314'>Endodermal sinus tumor</z:mpath> and paratesticular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> were the dominant histologic subtypes in each group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common mode of presentation was painless scrotal mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At initial presentation, retroperitoneal (n = 5), both retroperitoneal and lung (n = 2), and retroperitoneal and liver (n = 3) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were recorded in 10 (19%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initial operative procedures were radical inguinal orchiectomy (RIO) (n = 29), scrotal orchiectomy (SO; n = 9), bilateral RIO (n = 2), both RIO and unilateral retroperitoneal lymph node (RPLN) excision (n = 6), testis-sparing enucleation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="29824">SOs</z:chebi> were performed elsewhere, and these patients underwent high ligation (n = 4) and both high ligation plus RPLN excision (n = 5) in our unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histopathologically, spermatic cord invasion and RPLN involvement were present in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Scrotal recurrences were encountered in 2 patients who had scrotal orchiectomy initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Retroperitoneal recurrences were noted in a patient presenting with stage I embryonal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and in 2 patients presenting with group IV paratesticular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 89 +/- 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Four patients with stage IV embryonal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (n = 2) and group IV paratesticular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> (n = 2) died of progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> remaining patients were alive and disease free at their last outpatient appointment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was noted with regard to 5-year survival rates between (1) malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e> and paratesticular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> patients (91% v 80%) and (2) patients treated by RIO (88%), SO plus high ligation (87%), and RIO plus RPLN excision (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival rates were 100% for stage I, II, III patients and 33.3% for stage IV and group IV patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153594" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant testicular tumors</z:e> (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039590" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">testicular tumors</z:e> deserve special attention from the therapeutic point of the view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A solid scrotal mass should be considered malignant until proved otherwise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Any suspicion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039590" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">testicular tumor</z:e> warrants an inguinal approach to prevent scrotal violation by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Current trends emphasize that testis-sparing surgery should be performed for benign lesions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009592'>leydig cell tumor</z:mp>, and epidermoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> based on frozen biopsy findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Literature findings and our experience suggest that RIO is the accurate treatment for stage I malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e> and group I and IIa paratesticular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>RPLN excision is not of benefit either as a staging or therapeutic procedure in stage I and group I and IIa diseases of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>RPLN excision should be reserved for (1) malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e> patients who have persistent elevation of alpha-fetoprotein after orchiectomy in the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> total body CT scan, and for patients presenting with stage II and III disease with definitive abnormality on CT scans, and (2) group IIb, IIc, and III paratesticular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> patients with radiologic evidence of retroperitoneal involvement on CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>High ligation should be done as a complementary procedure after SO to increase the survival rates </plain></SENT>
