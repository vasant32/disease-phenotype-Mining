<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this 5-year period, 1245 cases were recorded in males (an estimated age-standardized incidence of 92.0 per 100,000) and 1003 in females (an age standardised rate (ASR) of 88.8 per 105) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall percentage of cases with histological verification was just 41.8%, indicating that case-finding outside the laboratory had been quite successful; nevertheless the rather low rates suggest possible underdiagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, as well as cases missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As in other reports from the region, the contemporary pattern is dominated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo> (KS) (55.2% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in men, 28% in women), the effect of the evolving epidemic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007847" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervix cancer</z:e> in women is high (ASR 26.2 per 105), and there are moderately high rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> (ASR 15.4 per 105 in men, 9.3 per 105 in women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In childhood, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> profile is dominated by Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which accounts for 42.4% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>; KS is now the second most frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> of childhood </plain></SENT>
