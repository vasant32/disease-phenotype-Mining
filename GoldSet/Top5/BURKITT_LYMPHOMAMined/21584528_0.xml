<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In six out of ten published <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> sequences the translocated c-myc gene contains mutations and/or deletions in an Spl site in the first exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show by competition gel mobility shift assays and association constant comparison that the binding of Spl to this site is altered in four of these clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The affinity of Spl for this site is increased 5-10 fold in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> BL22 and decreased approximately 5 fold in BL2 </plain></SENT>
