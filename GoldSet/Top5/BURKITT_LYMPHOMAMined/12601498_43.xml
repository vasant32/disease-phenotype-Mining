<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To be a reliable predictor of response, changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> [(18)F]FDG uptake should reflect changes in viable cell fraction, but little is known about the contribution of apoptotic and necrotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells and inflammatory tissue to the [(18)F]FDG signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> mouse model we investigated the relation between chemotherapy-induced changes in various tumoral components and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> uptake and size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice were subcutaneously inoculated in the right thigh with 5 x 10(6) Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> measured 15-20 mm, Endoxan was given intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At different time points [1-15 days (d1-d15) after the injection of Endoxan], ex vivo autoradiography and histopathology were performed in two mice and [(18)F]FDG uptake in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> size were correlated with the different cell fractions measured with flow cytometry in five mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At d1/d3, similar reductions in [(18)F]FDG uptake and viable tumoral cell fraction were observed and these reductions preceded changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By d8/d10, [(18)F]FDG uptake had stabilised despite a further reduction in viable tumoral cell fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At these time points a major <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At d15, an increase in viable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells was again observed and this was accurately predicted by an increase in [(18)F]FDG uptake, while the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> volume remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast with variations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> volume, [(18)F]FDG is a good marker for chemotherapy response monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, optimal timing seems crucial since a transient increase in stromal reaction may result in overestimation of the fraction of viable cells </plain></SENT>
