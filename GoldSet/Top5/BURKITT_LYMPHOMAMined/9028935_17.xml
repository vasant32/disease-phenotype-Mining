<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene rearrangement is the most common genetic lesion in pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), occurring in about 25% of B-lineage cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that, among patients treated on St Jude protocols, <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> rearrangement independently conferred an excellent prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To extend these results to patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolite</z:chebi>-based therapy, we performed Southern blot analysis to determine the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene status of 104 cases of B-lineage ALL treated on Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group 8602, matched on age, gender, and leukocyte count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 52 failures among the 77 patients with germline <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>, compared with only 8 failures among 27 patients in the rearranged group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on a two-sided logistic regression analysis, stratified for age (subdivided at 10 years), leukocyte count (subdivided at 50,000), and gender, the estimated odds of failing by 4 years in the germline <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> group is 5.4 times that of the rearranged <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> group, with 95% confidence from 1.9 to 15.6, two-sided P = .0009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the presence of a rearranged <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene is also associated with an improved survival among patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolite</z:chebi>-based therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> newly diagnosed ALL patients should be screened for <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene rearrangements and suggest that these patients are candidates for less intensive therapy </plain></SENT>
