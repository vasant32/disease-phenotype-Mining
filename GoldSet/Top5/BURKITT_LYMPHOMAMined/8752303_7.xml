<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>53, 4164-4167, 1993) found no evidence of resistance in fibroblasts derived from p53 null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to compare the radiation response of hemopoietic colony-forming cells (in vitro CFC) and of fibroblastoid colony-forming cells or units (CFU-F) within the same tissue (marrow) in p53 null mice (-/-), heterozygotes (+/-) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> animals (+/+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have also tested the hypothesis that, in proliferating cells, radiation-induced cell killing is mediated through chromosome damage by examining the relationship between these end points in hemopoietic cells of the three mouse types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both in vitro CFC and CFU-F of -/- mice were resistant to cell killing compared with +/+ and +/- mice whose cellular sensitivities were indistinguishable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The resistance was characterized by a broader "shoulder" on the cell survival curve, i.e. a higher extrapolation number but similar D0 values using the multitarget model or a lower alpha coefficient using the linear-quadratic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of chromosomally abnormal marrow cells after irradiation was similar for the three genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, marrow cells with aberrations carried more aberrations in -/- mice than in +/+ or +/- mice such that the total number of aberrations per 100 cells was higher in -/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since there were no differences in the yields of aberrations between genotypes in spleen lymphocytes or in CFU-F (both noncycling at the time of irradiation) and less mitotic inhibition in -/- marrow cells than in +/+ or +/- cells, the chromosomal radiosensitivity of -/- marrow hemopoietic cells might be related to reduced cell cycle delay allowing insufficient time for repair, but other explanations have been considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We postulate that the radiation resistance of both hemopoietic CFC and CFU-F in -/- mice is a consequence of the failure of DNA/chromosome damage to trigger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> or permanent cell cycle arrest to the same extent as in the +/+ or +/- mice: hence the lack of correlation between chromosome damage and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the three mouse types </plain></SENT>
