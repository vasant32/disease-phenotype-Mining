<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported powerful pro-apoptotic actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi> (BEZ) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6716">medroxyprogesterone acetate</z:chebi> (MPA) against Burkitts <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that BEZ and MPA individually, and more potently when combined (BEZ+MPA), induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of unsorted and CD19(+ve)-selected CLL cells and abrogate the pro-proliferative activity of CD40(L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This action was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell specific, as the drugs had little impact on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antiproliferative actions of BEZ+MPA were associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the proapoptotic actions were associated with the generation of both ROS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> (MSO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BEZ increased <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> D(2) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>(2)) synthesis by CLL cells, and treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>(2) and its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> derivative 15dDelta(12,14,)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26346">PGJ</z:chebi>(2) recapitulated BEZ-induced antiproliferative and proapoptotic actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>(2) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, BW868C, did not block BEZ or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>(2) activity against CLL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The potency of BEZ+MPA against CLL cells mirrored that of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi>, and BEZ+MPA combined with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> was more potent than either treatment alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given the known safety profiles of BEZ and MPA, our data warrant further investigation of their potential as novel therapy for CLL </plain></SENT>
