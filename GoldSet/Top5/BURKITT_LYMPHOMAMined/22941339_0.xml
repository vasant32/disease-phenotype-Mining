<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a Î³-herpesvirus that infects &gt;90% of the human population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although EBV persists in its latent form in healthy carriers, the virus is also associated with several human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBV is strongly associated with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), even though there is still no satisfactory explanation of how EBV participates in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, new insights into the interplay between viruses and microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, it has been shown that B-cell differentiation in EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> is impaired at the post-transcriptional level by altered expression of hsa-miR-127 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that the overexpression of hsa-miR-127 is due to the presence of the EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and give evidence of a novel mechanism of direct regulation of the human miRNA by this <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that the combinatorial expression of EBNA1 and hsa-miR-127 affects the expression of master B-cell regulators in human memory B cells, confirming the scenario previously observed in EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> and cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A good understanding of these mechanisms will help to clarify the complex regulatory networks between host and pathogen, and favor the design of more specific treatments for EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
