<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within this element, we have found that a region, 580 bp long, encompassing the replicator DS element, shows the strongest affinity for the NM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, by cross-linking with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27899">cis-diamminedichloroplatinum</z:chebi>, we have identified two NM proteins with an apparent molecular weight of 85 and 60 kDa that, with high affinity and specificity, bind ori P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These proteins are not induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, but their interaction with ori P is lost upon induction of EBV lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data strongly suggest that the binding of ori P to specific components of the NM is required for EBV latent replication </plain></SENT>
