<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that expression of endogenous UCH L1 is significantly higher in B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells than in transformed cells of epithelial and fibroblastic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The specific hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 induces UCH L1 expression through direct activation of the uch l1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and direct mutagenesis we identified PU.1 binding sites on the uch l1 promoter, at least three of which are involved in this activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also show that the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> transcriptional co-activator EBNA2 dramatically increases PU.1-dependent up-regulation of endogenous UCH L1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, inhibition of PU.1 expression with specific shRNA resulted in reduction of UCH L1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that the ubiquitin-editing enzyme UCH L1 is a multifunctional pro-oncogenic factor involved in development and progression of certain lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
