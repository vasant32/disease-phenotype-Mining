<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">Mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil (MMF) has been increasingly used after liver transplantation (LT) in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our preliminary experience with MMF as rescue therapy after pediatric LT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 19 children received MMF for 21 indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age at LT was 30 months (range 7-149) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median initial oral dose of MMF was 23 mg/kg/day (range 12-43) orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up after initiation of MMF therapy was 642 days (range 229-1606) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1) Efficacy: MMF was indicated for rejection or insufficient immunosuppression in 16 cases, with normalization of both liver function tests and liver histology in 10 (62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MMF was successfully used in one patient with post-LT immmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and one patient with corticodependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In three patients with renal function impairment, MMF allowed reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A or tacrolimus blood levels, without subsequent rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>2) Tolerance: Six patients (32%) experienced eight side effects, mainly gastrointestinal and hematological, which resolved after cessation of MMF in five cases and dose reduction in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One case of posttransplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> (PTLD) occurred under MMF therapy (5.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients had EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary infection</z:e>, while under MMF therapy, without subsequent PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients had CMV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary infection</z:e>, and five CMV reactivation, under MMF therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seven remained asymptomatic, and one presented with CMV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014335" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enteritis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that MMF is an effective and safe <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> in pediatric LT recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Its use is hampered by frequent gastrointestinal and hematological side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>MMF does not seem to increase the risk of PTLD nor CMV disease </plain></SENT>
