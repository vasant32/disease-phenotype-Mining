<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This system provides an animal model for assessing the efficacy of vaccine protection against the virus which is intended to reduce the incidence of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> associated with EB <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e>, namely endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and undifferentiated nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cottontop tamarins have been vaccinated with the major envelope <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> of EB virus, gp340, incorporated into immune-stimulating complexes (iscoms) and were thereby protected against a 100% lymphomagenic dose of virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gp340 iscoms are highly immunogenic, requiring only a few micrograms of immunogen to induce protective immunity and thus would be a strong candidate for further development as an EB virus vaccine for use in man </plain></SENT>
