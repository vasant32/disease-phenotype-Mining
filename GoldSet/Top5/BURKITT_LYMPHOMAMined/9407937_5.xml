<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These rearrangements may be amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and used as clonal markers of B lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to study clonality at the DNA level by PCR in B lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three pediatric patients (36 with B lineage ALL, 7 with ALL-T, and 10 with nonlymphocytic disease) were investigated using consensus primers for the CDR-3 regions of IgH and TCR delta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clonality was detected in 86.1% of the patients with B lineage ALL when the primers for the CDR-3 regions were used, in 41.6% when the primers for TCR delta were used, and in 91.6% when the two primers were used together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biclonality was found in 22.5% and 6.6% of patients that have shown clonality for CDR-3 and TCR delta, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clonality was not detected in any other samples using these primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PCR using CDR-3 and TCR delta primers can be used as an aid for B lineage ALL diagnosis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> of theses disease </plain></SENT>
