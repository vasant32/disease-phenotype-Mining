<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we report that treatment of IM-9 B lymphoblastoid cells or Raji Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum for 24 hr increased both the CR2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level and CR2 surface protein expression more than two-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No change in the CR2 expression level was observed if cells were cultured in serum-free medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CD19 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level decreased after 24 hr independently of the presence of serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum-stimulated increase in CR2 expression was not due to changes in the proliferative capacity of the cells and could not be mimicked by various cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, IFN-gamma as well as OKB7, a CR2-specific monoclonal antibody, blocked the serum-induced increase in CR2 expression at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data show for the first time that factors in serum induce the expression of the CR2 gene and that signals initiated by IFN-gamma and OKB7 interfere with the serum-induced changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because stimuli that alter CR2 expression can influence the extent of the B cell response to antigen-C3d complexes, serum factors may play a role in regulating the responsiveness of B cells </plain></SENT>
