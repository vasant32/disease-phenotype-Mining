<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Usual prophylaxis and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo> consist of hydration, alkalinization, and administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase) in adult patients with aggressive NHL during their first cycle of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 100 patients from <z:chebi fb="98" ids="24433">Groupe</z:chebi> d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte centers, with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 79); anaplastic large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 6); peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 8); transformation of indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 5); Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1); and lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1) were enrolled from May 2001 to June 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before chemotherapy, 66% of patients had elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), including 28% with LDH above 1,000 U/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven percent of patients were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740394" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperuricemic</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> [UA] &gt; 450 mmol/L or &gt; 7.56 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rasburicase 0.20 mg/kg/d intravenously for 3 to 7 days was started the day before or at day 1 of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>UA levels were measured 4 hours after rasburicase injection, then daily during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients responded to rasburicase, as defined by normalization of UA levels maintained during chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The control of UA was obtained within 4 hours after the first injection of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">Creatinine</z:chebi> levels and other metabolites were also controlled with the administration of rasburicase </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rasburicase is the treatment of choice to control UA and prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor lysis syndrome</z:e> in adult patients with aggressive NHL </plain></SENT>
