<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors, involved in a major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-dependent signalling pathway, normally reside in the cytoplasm but re-locate to the nucleus when activation of the pathway (e.g. following ligation of antigen receptors) leads to their dephosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study found that one member of the NFAT family (NFATc1/NFAT2) can be detected in routine biopsy samples, where it is seen in essentially <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lymphoid cells, but is absent from the great majority of non-haematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An immunohistological evaluation of NFATc1 in almost 300 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed that most neoplastic lymphoid cells also express NFATc1 as a cytoplasmic constituent, although it is absent in classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and plasma cell proliferations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest was the finding that NFATc1 was relocated to the nucleus in a minority of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (usually diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> or Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), presumably reflecting activation of the NFAT pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It would be of interest to correlate this feature with patterns of gene expression and also with prognosis, since it may identify a subset of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that is distinct in its molecular and clinical features </plain></SENT>
