<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SHP-1 is an SH2 domain-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase that negatively regulates activation of B cells and other cells of hematopoietic lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have found that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 EBV-negative and 11 EBV-positive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a nonlymphoblastoid phenotype, the mean concentration of SHP-1 was reduced to 5% of that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B and T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The possibility that this diminished expression of SHP-1 was related to the germinal center phenotype of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was supported by the low to absent immunofluorescent staining for SHP-1 in germinal centers, and by the inverse relationship between the concentration of SHP-1 and the expression of the germinal center marker CD38 on purified tonsillar B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In CD38-high B cells, SHP-1 concentration was 20% of that of mantle zone B cells from the same donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This reduction in SHP-1 is comparable to that of cells from motheaten viable mev/mev mice in which there is dysregulated, spontaneous signaling by cytokine and antigen receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, germinal center B cells may have a developmentally regulated, low threshold for cellular activation </plain></SENT>
