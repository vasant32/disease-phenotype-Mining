<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MTX was given according to Frei III et al's regimen(1975) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In brief, alkalinization of the urine was achieved by administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32139">NaHCO3</z:chebi> both by oral and by intravenous route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hydration with at least 3 liters of fluid per day was maintained throughout each course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MTX was administered as a six-hour infusion at an initial dose of 0.5-1.0 g/m2 with gradual escalation to 3-5 g/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes before the infusion of MTX, 1.4 mg/m2 of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> (VCR) (maximum dose 2 mg) was given intravenously in each course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MTX levels were not monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 63% with 7 partial responses and 5 complete responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five of 10 previously untreated patients and 7 of 9 patients with prior chemotherapy achieved an objective response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our excellent result may be contributed in part by VCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although, in general, during this study HDMTX-LCV was well-tolerated, a 67 year-old male had severe and unpredictable toxicity which resulted in shock condition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we feel that HDMTX-LCV is dangerous without monitoring plasma MTX level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In other side effects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> possibly due to VCR occurred especially in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
