<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated p24 cell surface antigen are currently being used to purge bone marrow of malignant cells before autologous transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their use as potential diagnostic reagents for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> is also under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been assumed throughout these investigations that the p24-specific MoAb produced by different laboratories <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identify the same antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our present studies indicate that at least two populations of p24 antigens, having different chemical properties and cellular distributions, exist on malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For example, eight MoAb raised to ALL cells (ALL-MoAb) identify a p24 antigen on these cells but do not react with the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Ramos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, six MoAb raised to Ramos (Ramos-MoAb) identify a p24 antigen on both Ramos and ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative binding of both sets of MoAb to ALL cells is comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ALL-MoAb react with platelets, granulocytes, and activated but not resting T lymphocytes, whereas the Ramos-MoAb react with both resting and activated T lymphocytes but not with platelets or granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ALL-MoAb react with 11 of 34 human hematopoietic cell lines tested; the Ramos-MoAb react with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both sets of MoAb react with most of the nonhematopoietic human cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reciprocal exhaustive radioimmune precipitation experiments performed with an ALL cell line indicate that the antigenic determinants recognized by these two sets of MoAb are present on different molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, proteolytic digests of iodinated antigens identified by these two sets of MoAb on ALL cells confirm the unique chemical identities of these molecules and suggest that they reflect the products of different genetic loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of the antigen identified by the Ramos-MoAb on every cell population tested except granulocytes suggests that it may serve an important cellular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The existence of two populations of p24 antigens on at least some hematopoietic cells indicates the need for caution when comparing the results of studies of these antigens by groups employing different MoAb </plain></SENT>
