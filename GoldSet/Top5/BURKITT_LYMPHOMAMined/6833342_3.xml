<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This antigen was purified from Namalwa RNP by column chromatography on Sephacryl S-200, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52255">hydroxylapatite</z:chebi> and one-dimensional <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A liver protein with the same molecular weight and pI value was purified from RNP fraction by one-dimensional <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both proteins had similar amino-acid compositions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The tryptic map of 125I-labeled protein 52/5.3 contained approximately nine major spots; spot 9 was present in the Namalwa protein but not in the liver protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The similarity of the structures of these proteins and their differences in antigenicity are noteworthy and require further structural and functional analysis </plain></SENT>
