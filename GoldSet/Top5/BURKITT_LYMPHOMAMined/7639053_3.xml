<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 150-bp PCR fragment that encodes the 49-amino-acid human TP <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was isolated from genomic placental DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its colinearity with the cDNA sequence suggests lack of introns within the coding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was demonstrated in lymphocytes from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the differentiation stages investigated, as well as in a myeloid cell line (K-562) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a further expansion of the proposed TP functions </plain></SENT>
