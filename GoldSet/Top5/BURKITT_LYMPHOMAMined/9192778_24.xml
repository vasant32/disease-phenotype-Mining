<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with two-dimensional (2D) image analysis, the locations of ABL and BCR genes in cell nuclei were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The center of nucleus-to-gene and mutual distances of ABL and BCR genes in interphase nuclei of nonstimulated and stimulated lymphocytes as well as in lymphocytes stimulated after irradiation were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that, after stimulation, the ABL and BCR genes move towards the membrane, their mutual distances increase, and the shortest distance between heterologous ABL and BCR genes increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the shortest distances between ABL and BCR genes in the G0 phase of lymphocytes corresponds to the theoretical distribution calculated by the Monte-Carlo simulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the shortest ABL-BCR distances in G1 and S(G2) nuclei are greater in experiment as compared with theory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This result suggests the existence of a certain regularity in the gene arrangement in the G1 and S(G2) nuclei that keeps ABL and BCR genes at longer than random distances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in about 2% to 8% of lymphocytes, the ABL and BCR genes are very close to each other (the distance is less than approximately 0.2 to 0.3 microm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For comparison, we studied another pair of genes, c-MYC and IgH, that are critical for the induction of t(8;14) translocation that occurs in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that in about 8% of lymphocytes, c-MYC and IgH are very close to each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained for human fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>gamma-Radiation leads to substantial changes in the chromatin structure of stimulated lymphocytes: ABL and BCR genes are shifted to the nuclear center, and mutual ABL-BCR distances become much shorter in the G1 and S(G2) nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesize that the changes of chromatin structure in the irradiated lymphocytes might increase the probability of a translocation during G1 and S(G2) stages of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The fact that the genes involved in the t(8;14) translocation are also located close together in a certain fraction of cells substantiates the hypothesis that physical distance plays an important role in the processes leading to the translocations that are responsible for oncogenic transformation of cells </plain></SENT>
