<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> half maximum inhibitory concentration (1 nM) was comparable to that inducing a half maximal increase of intracellular cAMP (4nM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together these data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> inhibits the IL-4 induced Fc epsilon R2/CD23 through an increase of intracellular cAMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IFN-gamma, which strongly inhibits IL-4-mediated Fc epsilon R2/CD23 expression on Jijoye cells, did not increase intracellular cAMP levels and thus probably acts through another mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> did not inhibit binding of IL-4 to its receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It could be excluded that IFN-gamma and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> were acting via an alteration/desensitization of the IL-4R inasmuch as 24 h pre-incubation of Jijoye cells with these agents affected neither the affinity of 125I-IL-4 for its receptor (Kd = 0.8 to 1.5 x 10(-10) M) nor the maximal number of binding sites per Jijoye cells (Bmax = 390 to 550) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IFN-gamma and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> did not affect the internalization and degradation of 125I-IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> and IFN-gamma inhibit the IL-4-mediated induction of Fc epsilon R2/CD23 on B lymphocytes via different mechanisms that do not alter the interaction of IL-4 with its receptor </plain></SENT>
