<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on a series of 320 patients examined by myelography, the authors try to define the profile of lumbar spine disease in Black Africans in Abidjan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This disease is dominated by degenerative anomalies and a predominance of degenerative disk disease (54.20%) over disk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> (33.33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the usual data of the literature, these lesions were essentially observed in subjects whose work required limited physical stress to the lumbar spine: variable postures and prolonged sitting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Neoplastic disease</z:e> was marked by secondary lesions due to Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, infectious and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030499" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">parasitic disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852325" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemoglobinopathies</z:e> were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diseases such as nerve root anomalies and Tarlov's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> were not observed in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies in nonselected patients are necessary to more clearly define these data which suggest features specific to Black Africans compared to the data generally reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
