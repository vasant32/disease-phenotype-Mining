<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously identified zinc finger (ZF) protein ZNF385B as a molecule specifically expressed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated ZNF385B expression in healthy B cells in a variety of hematological tissues by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ZNF385B expression was found to be limited to a subset of GC B cells, the healthy counterpart to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the function of ZNF385B in healthy B cells, we established a <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-controlled protein-inducible system in B-cell lines and observed that ectopic expression of the longest transcript variant of ZNF385B, possessing four ZF domains, induced upregulation of PERP and FAS/CD95, a downstream target of p53, and activation of caspase, resulting in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a ZNF385B deletion mutant with three ZF domains corresponding to shorter isoforms, did not induce upregulation; rather it inhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by CD20 cross-linking and BCR stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The direct binding of ZNF385B with p53 has suggested the involvement of ZNF385B in B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> via modulation of p53 transactivation; our data indicate that ZNF385B characteristically expressed in GC B cells has both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic activities depending on the type of isoform and should be a novel player in GC B-cell selection </plain></SENT>
