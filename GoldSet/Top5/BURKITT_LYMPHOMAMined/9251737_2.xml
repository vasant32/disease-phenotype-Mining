<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In five children with stage III or IV non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (three lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; two Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), etiology remained unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In these children, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> occurred early in the course of therapy </plain></SENT>
