<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Type and duration of treatment for highly aggressive non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has been a matter of debate over the past decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the therapeutic efficacy of an abbreviated treatment regimen, 26 patients with newly-diagnosed highly aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 17 of them belonging to the International Working Formulation (IWF) group I and 9 with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (IWF J), were entered in a study using short-term weekly chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Besides histology, requirements for entry into to the study were age between 16 and 60 years, stage 1 bulky disease and elevated LDH or stage II to IV disease with or without bulk or elevated LDH, and an absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> or <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment plan was 12 weeks of MACOP-B or VACOP-B chemotherapy followed by high dose therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation in first complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients (76%), 16 (62%) of those on MACOP-B or VACOP-B, 1 who had received 2 cycles of ProMACE-CytaBOM prior to MACOP-B and 3 after a first salvage regimen, achieved complete remissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (65%) were transplanted in first remission, and 15 (58%) after induction treatment with only MACOP-B or VACOP-B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reasons for not being given high dose therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) were failure to achieve complete remission in 6 patients, early relapse in 2 and severe pulmonary toxicity associated with chemotherapy in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time of follow-up was 45 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 3 years, the estimated event-free survival was 31% (CI 14%-50%) and the overall survival 48% (CI 25%-67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from toxic effects of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment factors associated with relapse were stage III or IV disease, age over 30 years and bone marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Logrank analysis showed that age was the only factor significantly associated with poor event-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Short-term weekly chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy with the CBV regimen in first remission is not a higly effective treatment for advanced lymphoblastic and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 30% rate of failure to achieve partial remission after 6 weeks and/or complete response after 12 weeks of MACOP-B or VACOP-B treatment, as well as the 42% failure rate to undergo ABMT in first remission, suggest that more aggressive chemotherapy should be used in the beginning </plain></SENT>
