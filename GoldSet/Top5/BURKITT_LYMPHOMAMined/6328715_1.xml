<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incorporation of ATP on poly(A) primers catalyzed by poly(A) polymerase was investigated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic lymphoid cells from animal and human sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High levels of the enzyme were found in mouse thymus, in chicken bursa and thymus, as well as in neoplastic cells from patients affected by lymphoblastic and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low or very low quantities were found in peripheral blood lymphocytes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cells, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymph nodes and solid lymphoid tissues of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In general, the enzymatic content of neoplastic lymphoid cells reflected those of their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No effect of fasting or <z:chebi fb="11" ids="16962">cortisone</z:chebi> treatment on poly(A) polymerase in mouse spleen, thymus or liver was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No particular relationships with B, T or non-T, non-B lineages were observed, but some relationship with DNA polymerase alpha was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it may be that poly(A) polymerase levels are related to the proliferative activity of the cellular populations </plain></SENT>
