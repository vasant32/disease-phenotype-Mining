<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LMP1 is known to be an oncogene in rodent fibroblasts and to induce B-lymphocyte activation and cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules in the EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Louckes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBNA-2 is required for EBV-induced growth transformation; it lowers rodent fibroblast serum dependence and specifically induces the B-lymphocyte activation antigen CD23 in Louckes cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These initial observations are now extended through an expanded study of EBNA- and LMP1-induced phenotypic effects in a different EBV-negative B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, BJAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LMP1 effects were also evaluated in the EBV-negative B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BL41 and the EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Daudi (Daudi is deleted for EBNA-2 and does not express LMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previously described EBNA-2- and LMP1-transfected Louckes cells were studied in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBNA-2, from EBV-1 strains but not EBV-2, induced CD23 and CD21 expression in transfected BJAB cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, EBNA-3C induced CD21 but not CD23, while no changes were evident in vector control-, EBNA-1-, or EBNA-LP-transfected clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EBNAs did not affect CD10, CD30, CD39, CD40, CD44, or cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LMP1 expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines induced growth in large clumps and expression of the cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules ICAM-1, LFA-1, and LFA-3 in those cell lines which constitutively express low levels </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LMP1 induction of these cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules was also associated with increased heterotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> marker, CALLA (CD10), was uniformly down regulated by LMP1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, LMP1 induced unique profiles of B-lymphocyte activation antigens in the various cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LMP1 induced CD23 and CD39 in BJAB; CD23 in Louckes; CD39 and CD40 in BL41; and CD21, CD40, and CD44 in Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In BJAB, CD23 surface and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were markedly increased by EBNA-2 and LMP1 coexpression, compared with EBNA-2 or LMP1 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This cooperative effect was CD23 specific, since no such effect was observed on another marker, CD21.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
