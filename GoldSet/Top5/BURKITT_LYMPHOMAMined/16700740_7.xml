<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: CD10 is expressed on the majority of follicle-center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD10 has also been shown to be present in a variety of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The aim of this study was a correlation of CD10 and several parameters: age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e>, clinic stage, histologic grading, presence of local recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The tissues of 77 consecutive patients with oral cavity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> were evaluated using immunostaining with monoclonal antibody for CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Highly significant correlations were found with the lymph node status, the presence of local recurrences and the histologic grading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of CD10-positive cells was not correlated with the age of patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size and clinic stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results of the present study show that in oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> CD10 positivity is an indicator of worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another strong correlation was found with the presence of local recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also the histologic grade was significantly correlated with the CD10 positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results point to the fact that CD10 expression can, perhaps, have an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion, probably facilitating the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
