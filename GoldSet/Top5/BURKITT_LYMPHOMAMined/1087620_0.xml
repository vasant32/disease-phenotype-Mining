<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three groups of patients were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>1) 14 patients with B derived ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only three patients had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e>; in the other cases the blastic proliferation was featured by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumor</z:e> cells or supervened in patients affected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2) The blast cells from 28% of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> had T cell properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3) The cells from the largest group of patients did not bear B or T cell markers but were featured by the presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated antigen revealed by a rabbit antiserum to CLL B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies with another antiserum to CLL B cells as well as with an antiserum to foetal thymocytes revealed also <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated antigens but these antigenic determinants were present on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> cells which had been tested and were therefore of no help to classify various <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A number of clinical and hematological findings were more frequent in the group of patients with T cell ALL: high white blood cell counts, tumoral disease, thymic enlargement, meningeal involvement, strong acid phosphatase activity in blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However no difference in the survival curve is yet apparent at 30 months </plain></SENT>
