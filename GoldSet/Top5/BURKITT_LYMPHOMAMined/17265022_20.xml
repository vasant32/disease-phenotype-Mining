<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gamma delta (gammadelta) T cells are of particular interest for use in such combined therapies due to their potent antitumour cytotoxicity and relative ease of generation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate high levels of cytotoxicity against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumour</z:e>-derived cell lines with combination treatment utilizing Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells, chemotherapeutic agents and the bisphosphonate, zoledronate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment with low concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents or zoledronate sensitized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells to rapid killing by Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells with levels of cytotoxicity approaching 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, zoledronate enhanced the chemotherapy-induced sensitization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells to Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell cytotoxicity resulting in almost 100% lysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> targets in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell cytotoxicity was mediated by perforin following TCR-dependent and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24913">isoprenoid</z:chebi>-mediated recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Production of IFN-gamma by Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells was also induced after exposure to sensitized targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that administration of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells at suitable intervals after chemotherapy and zoledronate may substantially increase antitumour activities in a range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
