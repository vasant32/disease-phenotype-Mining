<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on data from retrospective series, DH has been correlated with aggressive clinical behaviour and poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a consecutive study of DH incidence and correlation with pathologic and clinical characteristics, including response to Rituximab-containing chemotherapy and survival, in an unselected cohort of patients with LBCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Translocations involving BCL2 and MYC loci were examined with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in 157 patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) or B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (BCLU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of DH was 11% in the total cohort, 7% of primary LBCL and 21% of transformed LBCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DH <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> GCB immunophenotype and were more often BCLU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No clinical characteristics were correlated with the presence of DH, which also had no impact on overall response rate (ORR), relapse rate or overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, sub-stratification of DH <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> by FISH indicated a possible inferior survival related to immunoglobulin MYC translocation partner gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Screening of patients with BCLU and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> of GCB type for DH BCL2/MYC translocation including MYC translocation partner gene may provide important prognostic information </plain></SENT>
