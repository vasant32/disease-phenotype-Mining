<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that both lines produce the active and inactive forms of TGF beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was shown earlier that a larger number of cells can be induced to enter the lytic cycle by exposing P3HR-I to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol esters</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> and the surface IgG-positive Akata cells to anti-IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now show that the same treatments raise the level of active TGF beta release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exposure to anti-TGF beta antibodies reduced EA induction by 75-85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that induction of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> productive cycle by the above-mentioned reagents is at least partly dependent on the activation of endogenous TGF beta production </plain></SENT>
