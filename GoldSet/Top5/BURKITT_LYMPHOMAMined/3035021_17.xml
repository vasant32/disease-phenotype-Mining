<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed cells of the B lineage for expression of the Tp44 antigen, a 44,000 homodimer detected by monoclonal antibody 9.3 on approximately 80% of mature human T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous evidence has suggested that Tp44 may function as a receptor for accessory signals in T cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High level Tp44 expression was observed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> grown in cell culture and on plasma cells from bone marrow biopsies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This antigen is not present on resting B cells from either peripheral blood or lymphoid organs, or on any other B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The growth kinetics and Ig production in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> are not affected by the binding of antibody 9.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the Tp44 molecule is co-expressed with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>-1, an antigen characteristic of plasma cells, on peripheral blood B cells stimulated in vitro to differentiate toward plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tp44 may represent a later stage of B cell differentiation than <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>-1 because unlike the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>-1 antigen, this molecule could not be detected on any EBV-transformed cell line or Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The m.w. of the Tp44 molecule expressed on plasma cells and on T cells is identical, as determined by immunoprecipitation of radioiodinated cell surface proteins with monoclonal antibody 9.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This antigen might be useful in studying the mechanism of growth and differentiation of human B cells, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> within plasma cell populations, and B cell interactions with other components of the immune system </plain></SENT>
