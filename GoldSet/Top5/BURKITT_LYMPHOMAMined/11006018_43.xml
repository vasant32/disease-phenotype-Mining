<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With a new flow cytometric cytotoxicity assay, we examined the mechanism of action of chimeric mouse human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody IDEC-C2B8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IDEC-C2B8 alone induced direct cytotoxicity in four of eight examined CD20-expressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (RAJI, DAUDI, JOK-1, and WT100) at a concentration above 100 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, after 4 h incubation in human serum, only a moderate complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDCC) was observed, whereas cytotoxicity increased markedly after 3 days of culture, indicating that combined direct cytotoxicity and CDCC were responsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IDEC-C2B8 induced an effective antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in seven of eight tested <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines when peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as effector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ADCC was moderately enhanced by cytokine interleukin-2, whereas interleukin-12, interferon-alpha, and GM-CSF had no influence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we could demonstrate a correlation between CD32 expression on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and IDEC-C2B8-induced direct cytotoxicity, indicating that crosslinking of CD20 with CD32 may be involved in the mechanism of cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that direct cytotoxicity, CDCC, and ADCC result in the marked elimination of CD20-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells observed after treatment with IDEC-C2B8 </plain></SENT>
