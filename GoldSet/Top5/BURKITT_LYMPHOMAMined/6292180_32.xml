<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The binding of 125I-labeled alpha A interferon to human lymphoblastoid Daudi cells decreased when these cells were incubated with unlabeled alpha or beta interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This decrease could not be accounted for by the occupancy of interferon receptors with unlabeled interferon and it apparently resulted from the loss or down-regulation of receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The binding activity gradually increased when Daudi cells were incubated in fresh medium after a treatment with interferon, but inhibition of protein synthesis with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> prevented this recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of Daudi cells with this inhibitor resulted in the loss of half the interferon binding activity within 5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that the interferon receptors turn over at a basal rate in interferon-free medium and at an increased rate in cells incubated with interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dose-response for the down-regulation was investigated by treating Daudi cells with different concentrations of alpha interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation was observed in cells treated with relatively low doses of interferon, sufficient to elicit a biological response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The synthesis of the enzyme (2',5')oligo(A) polymerase was induced at the lowest interferon concentrations tested which caused receptor down-regulation </plain></SENT>
