<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The chromosomes of 16 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) derived cell lines were submitted to high-resolution G-band analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They included seven lines with t(8;14), three with t(2;8), and four with t(8;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The translocation breakpoint in chromosome #14 was located in 14q32.3, in chromosome #2 in 2p11.1, and in chromosome #22 in 22q12.12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In chromosome #8, the translocation breakpoint was located in two cytogenetically distinct subbands: 8q24.1 in cell lines with t(8;14) and t(2;8) and 8q24.22 in cell lines with t(8;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the light of recent molecular findings, these results indicate that the distance between the c-myc gene, located in 8q24, and the Ig sequences might be much larger in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines with t(8;22) than in those with t(2;8) </plain></SENT>
