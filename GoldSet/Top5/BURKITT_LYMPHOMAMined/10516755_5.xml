<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> are characteristically refractory to conventional chemotherapeutic treatments operating through the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), a potent inhibitor of hematopoiesis, acts in part by upregulating CD95 and sensitizing cells to CD95-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Addition of IFNgamma markedly upregulated CD95 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> (8-9-fold), RS4;11 (2-3-fold), and MV4;11 (2-3-fold) lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, after treatment with IFNgamma, only an 11% increase in sensitivity to CD95-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> cells, whereas RS4;11 and MV4;11 cells remained resistant </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abundant levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, known to inhibit CD95-signaling in some cells, were present suggesting a possible role for both molecules in the resistance to CD95-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Resistance of the leukemic blasts to CD95-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the failure of IFNgamma to substantially sensitize the CD95-signaling pathway may contribute to the highly malignant phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pro-B ALL</z:e> with translocation t(4;11) </plain></SENT>
