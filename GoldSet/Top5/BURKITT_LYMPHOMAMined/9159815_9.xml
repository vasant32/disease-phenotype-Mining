<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This symptom heralded the initial progression of the disease in the first and second cases and the recurrence of the disease in the third case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these cases tenderness in the mental foramen, percussion pain of the teeth, loosening and extrusion of the teeth, and radiographic abnormalities were also, if not always, observed in association with mental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The radiographic abnormalities included a disappearance of the mandibular canals, an enlarged periodontal ligament space, a loss or thinning of the lamina dura, and a destruction of the alveolar crestal bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This report indicates that oral manifestations can therefore occasionally play an extremely important role in the early recognition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The unexplained oral abnormalities such as numbness of the chin and lower lip must thus be considered, potentially ominous indication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
