<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Group I cells react only with MAbs J5 and 38.13, recognising the common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> antigen and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-associated antigen respectively; group II cells react with J5 and 38.13 and with one or more of a set of MAbs (Ki-24, MHM6, AC2, Ki-1) against "lymphoblastoid" antigens; group III cells react only with these anti-"lymphoblastoid" MAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> biopsy cells from 17 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, 9 positive for the Epstein-Barr (EB) virus genome and 8 negative, have been analysed during the process of cell line establishment in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In early passage the EB virus-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells showed either a group I phenotype or gave an additional reactivity with MAb Ki-24 which placed them in group II; these phenotypes remained essentially stable with continued growth of the cell lines for up to 50 passages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast the EB virus-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells were much more susceptible to phenotypic change in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although such cells displayed a group I or group II phenotype in early passage, many of the lines soon moved into group III whilst retaining the karyotypic markers indicative of their malignant origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that a resident EB virus genome can drive the in vitro progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells towards a more "lymphoblastoid" phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed in subsequent experiments where virus-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines were converted to EB virus positivity by in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clearly, therefore, phenotypic analysis of long-established lines can lead to false distinctions being drawn between the EB virus-positive and -negative forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>; both may derive from the same sub-population of target B cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
