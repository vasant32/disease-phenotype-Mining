<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mass invaded the soft tissue behind the right eye and extended ventro-medially through the lacrimal, ethmoid, maxillary and frontal bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Caudo-dorsal extention of the mass through the left frontal bone and into the meninges and parenchyma of the frontal cerebral lobe was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the cell population making up the mass was variable, but most of the neoplastic cells were blast-like with a large central round to ovoid nucleus, active coarsely stippled euchromatic chromatin, 1-4 prominent nucleoli and sparse cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interspersed between these neoplastic lymphocytes were numerous aberrant mitoses and histiocytes with foamy cytoplasm producing a "starry-sky" pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cells further away from the central neoplastic core and closer to fragmented bone surfaces had plasmacytoid features with an eccentric hyperchromatic nucleus and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy confirmed the formentioned cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Morphometric analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell indicated similarities to cells of human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells indicated similarities to cells of human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was diagnosed as a malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of unknown etiology, similar to those seen in African children with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
