<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The activated c-myc allele in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is associated with a clustering of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> within a discrete domain of intron I that define protein recognition sequences, designated as myc intron factors (MIF-1, MIF-2 and MIF-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that MIF-1 binding activity consists of two <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi>, myc intron binding <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (MIBP1) and RFX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we identified two <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi>, p105 and p115, and showed that these proteins give rise to a DNA-protein complex at the MIF-2 as well as the adjacent MIF-1 site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four proteins interact with a novel MIF-1 like motif upstream from the c-myc promoter region, designated 5'MIF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a model, where the interactions of MIBP1/RFX1 and p105/p115 with the MIF-like sites may play a role in the promoter topology of the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
