<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report represents the first detailed study of a patient with American Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with numerous hand-mirror cells in the bone marrow during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Burkitt cells were atypical because of their hand-mirror configuration in the bone marrow, the presence of cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, the finding of an IgG surface marker, and a strongly positive acid phosphatase staining reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of increased numbers of hand-mirror forms in the bone marrow during the course of the patient's illness may have clinical significance, because they were replaced by non-hand-mirror Burkitt cells in the terminal phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More reports and investigations of patients with large numbers of hand-mirror forms in the bone marrow are needed to elucidate the full significance of this unusual cellular phenomenon </plain></SENT>
