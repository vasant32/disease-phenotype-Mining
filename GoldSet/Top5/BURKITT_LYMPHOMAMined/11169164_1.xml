<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their antitumour activity against human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> cells was evaluated and compared with that of equimolar doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only compound 7a, with the presence of both the pyridyl moiety bound at the ethylenic bridge in C-2 of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36622">benzimidazole</z:chebi> and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29785">nitro-group</z:chebi> in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="52879">benzene ring</z:chebi>, displays a selective antiproliferative effect against certain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> cells and a good antiviral activity especially towards the Coxsackie B5 virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it should be noted that, in the case of hydroxybenzyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36622">benzimidazole</z:chebi>, resistance also builds up to compound 7a, the Coxsackie B5 virus developing resistance to it after about ten runs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity tests show that many of these substances are well tolerated by the VERO cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of action is still unclear </plain></SENT>
