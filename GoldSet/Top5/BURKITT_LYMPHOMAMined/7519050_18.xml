<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution of breakpoints on chromosome 8 of 11 cell lines with t(8;22) has been investigated by in situ fluorescence hybridization and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that these chromosomal breakpoints generally fall within a region of about 300 kb 3' of MYC and that at least 8 out of 11 affect the previously characterized transcriptional unit PVT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparable results were obtained in earlier experiments analyzing the variant t(2;8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, in a series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells carrying t(8;14), breakpoints upstream of MYC have been described at a similar distance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our results suggest that deregulation of MYC by the immunoglobulin loci can occur at a distance of up to about 350 kbp of MYC </plain></SENT>
