<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the function of conditionally expressed EBNA2 in the context of the IFN response in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of EBNA2 led to the transcriptional activation of both endogenous or transfected IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), genes which contain within their promoters either the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) or the gamma interferon activation site (GAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In search of a molecular mechanism for the transcriptional induction of ISGs, we observed an EBNA2-dependent synthesis of IFN-beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> at low levels and the secretion of low amounts of IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A transfected IFN-beta promoter responded to EBNA2 activation, and a sequence closely resembling a RBP-Jkappa binding site was pinpointed as a potential target of EBNA2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBNA2-dependent transcriptional induction of the IFN-beta promoter occurred in EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, indicating that other EBV genes were not required for the induction of IFN-beta synthesis </plain></SENT>
