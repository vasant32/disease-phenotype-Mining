<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prognostic impact of +21 as a sole cytogenetic change could be due to a cryptic t(12;21)(p13;q22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of ETV6/RUNX1 was determined in 66 childhood ALLs with an acquired +21 and a chromosome number &lt;51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ETV6/RUNX1 was found in 45% of cases and in the majority (10/18; 56%) of ALLs with sole +21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival did not differ between the t(12;21)-positive and -negative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the prognostic impact of +21 is not attributable to cryptic ETV6/RUNX1 </plain></SENT>
