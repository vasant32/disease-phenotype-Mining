<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lymphoid cell lines from Americans with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (Choate, EH IV, and OP), and from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> American (Cassio), were tested for presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e>-like virus by electron microscopy (EM) and immunofluorescence (IF), and for complement-fixing (CF) antigens, using both American and African sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas earlier tests of seven African (Burkitt) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines showed an absolute correlation between presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e>-like virus and CF reactivity with either African or American sera, the same was not true of the American cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Herpes</z:e>-like particles were found in the Cassio line by both EM and IF, and in a few cells of the OP line by IF, but not by EM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The virus was not found in the Choate or EH IV lines by either EM or IF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>African sera from either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals or patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> contained CF antibodies to extracts of Cassio and OP cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> American sera contained CF antibodies to these extracts as well as to extracts of Choate cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EH IV cell line did not produce CF antigens detectable with either African or American sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that the CF antigens of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e> virus-negative Choate cell line were serologically distinct from those in Burkitt lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, it is possible that the antigens from both sources are related to the presence of the genome of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e>-like virus </plain></SENT>
