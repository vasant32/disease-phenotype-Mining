<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As these two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are difficult to distinguish using the current World Health Organization classification, we studied 39 cases of highly proliferative peripheral blastic B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (HPBCL) to establish a practical differential-diagnostic algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Characteristics set for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were a typical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, a mature B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> of CD10+, Bcl-6+ and Bcl-2- <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells, a proliferation rate of &gt;95%, and the presence of C-MYC rearrangements in the absence of t(14;18)(q32;q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these characteristics were found in only five of 39 cases, whereas the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> revealed mosaic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then followed a pragmatic stepwise approach for a classification algorithm that included the assessment of C-MYC status to stratify HPBCL into four predefined diagnostic categories (DC), namely DC I (5/39, 12.8%): 'classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>', DC II (11/39, 28.2%): 'atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>', DC III (9/39, 23.1%): 'C-MYC+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>' and DC IV (14/39, 35.9%): 'C-MYC- HPBCL' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This proposal may serve as a robust and objective operational basis for therapeutic decisions for HPBCL within 1 week and is applicable to be evaluated for its prognostic relevance in clinical trials with uniformly treated patients </plain></SENT>
