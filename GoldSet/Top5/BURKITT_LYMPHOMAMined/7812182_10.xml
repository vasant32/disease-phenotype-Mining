<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here that an EBV immediate-early (IE) protein, BRLF1 (R), transactivates the murine and human c-myc promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The R transactivator enhances expression from transiently transfected murine and human c-myc promoters as determined both at the CAT reporter and at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transactivation of the human c-myc promoter by R occurs in several different cell lines, and this effect is reporter-gene independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both the P1 and P2 c-myc promoters can be activated by the EBV R IE protein, although the R-induced transactivation of P1 is greater than P2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The portion of the human c-myc promoter from -228 to -63 (relative to the P1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> start site) is necessary, but not sufficient, for transactivation by R in the Louckes B-cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binding of the R protein directly to the c-myc promoter could not be demonstrated, suggesting that the effect of R on c-myc activity occurs by an indirect mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ability of an EBV protein to activate c-myc expression is likely to facilitate productive <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and is also potentially relevant in the genesis of EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
