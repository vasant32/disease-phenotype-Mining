<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We have previously reported the isolation of a G protein-coupled receptor, CXCR-4, that is overexpressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> multiforme <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue (GMTT), as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain tissue (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gene-specific RT-PCR, Northern blotting, and in situ hybridization techniques were used to study its expression in a variety of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues, and cell lines, as well as during development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antisense CXCR-4 was overexpressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> cells to study its effect on cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gene-specific RT-PCR analysis indicated that the CXCR-4 gene is overexpressed in several malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> tissues, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumor</z:e> tissues and cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis indicated that CXCR-4 is expressed at high levels in certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153567" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">uterine cancer</z:e>, and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The occipital and temporal lobe showed high levels of CXCR4 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CXCR-4 gene was expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> organs in the early stages of development (days 8-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In adult mouse, CXCR-4 is expressed only in brain, spinal cord, bone marrow, and pituitary gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Antisense CXCR-4 overexpression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> cells caused inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cellular differentiation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that CXCR-4 expression may play an important role during embryonic development and also in the genesis of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of CXCR4 expression data and antisense overexpression data, we conclude that CXCR-4 plays an important role in the tumorigenic properties of brain, breast, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the basis of its unique expression during mouse development, we conclude that it may play an important role in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> functioning of brain, spinal cord, and bone marrow during development </plain></SENT>
