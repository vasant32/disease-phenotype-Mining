<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A substantial proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> contain a marker chromosome 14q + </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> the marker 14q + was shown in the past to be due to a t(8;14)(q24;32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have pointed out that 8q - may be more characteristic and more specific for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than 14q +, since translocations involving chromosome 8 with 2 or 22 (and not 14) have been described in a significant number of cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although chromosome 14 appears to be most common recipient of translocated material in non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the donor chromosome may be one of a variety of chromosomes such as 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 11, 14, and 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To date, however, no clinical specificity of the donor chromosome in a particular type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It will be necessary to accumulate more such data, and to relate the information to cell markers, histologic features, stage, and therapeutic response in the cases involved, before a more precise classification of the non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> becomes available </plain></SENT>
