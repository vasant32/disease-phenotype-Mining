<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The capacity to be recognized and engulfed by phagocytes is an important characteristic of cells dying by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells occurs rapidly in vivo, probably prior to plasma membrane breakdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the molecular mechanisms mediating phagocytosis of apoptotic cells are beginning to be defined, little is yet known of the relationship between the cell-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> program itself and the surface changes on the dying cells that signal for engulfment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate to what extent the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> repressor Bcl-2 can modulate the recognition and phagocytosis of human B cells exposed to triggers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>)-derived, Bcl-2- B cells were induced into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> either by the Ca(2+)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> ionomycin or by the inhibitor of protein synthesis <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, but not viable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, were recognized and phagocytosed by monocyte-derived macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>bcl-2-transfected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> populations showed a reduced capacity both to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to these inducing agents and to interact with macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Like their Bcl-2- counterparts, Bcl-2+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells interacted with macrophages only after activation of their apoptotic program as assessed by changes in nuclear <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate not only that continued protein synthesis in B cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is not essential for their recognition by macrophages, but also that macrophage recognition of apoptotic B cells cannot be uncoupled from the cell-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> program that is controlled by Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this respect, the behavior of B cells contrasts markedly with that of neutrophils in which Bcl-2 has been reported to inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> without affecting phagocytic clearance </plain></SENT>
