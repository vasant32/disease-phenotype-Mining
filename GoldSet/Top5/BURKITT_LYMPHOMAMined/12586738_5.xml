<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Engagement of the B cell receptor antigen (BCR) triggers <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> on immature B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here that BCR triggering leads to caspase activation followed by Lyn cleavage and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cleavage process is mitochondrion-dependent and involves caspases 9 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stable expression of the cleaved form of Lyn (Lyn-Delta-N) in Ramos B cells impairs BCR-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as judged by loss of Delta(psi)m, caspase activation and PARP cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activation of the main survival pathways upon BCR-triggering was unaltered in both cell variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the PI3-K inhibitor Ly294002 resensitizes Lyn-Delta-N cells to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Selected cDNA expression arrays revealed that anti-IgM modulates the expression of approximately 20 genes in both cell variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among them, only c-Myc was found to be differentially regulated, which suggests a role for c-Myc in the B cell apoptotic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, c-Myc expression decreased more rapidly in Lyn-Delta-N compared with Lyn-WT cells during the first hours of anti-IgM stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, rapid down-regulation of c-Myc following BCR engagement seems to correlate with the resistance of B cells to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the soluble form of Lyn generated by caspases following BCR triggering acts as an inhibitor of B lymphocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> likely through the modulation of c-Myc expression </plain></SENT>
