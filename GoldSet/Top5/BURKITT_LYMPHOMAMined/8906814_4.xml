<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD22 is a key accessory molecule for Ag receptor signaling in B cells that becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in the signaling process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD22 associates with sIg and strongly amplifies sIg-induced signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During B cell development, CD22 is initially expressed intracellularly, with surface expression appearing with IgD expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used confocal laser-scanning microscopy and flow cytometry to analyze CD22 translocation responses to signaling events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cross-linking surface IgM (sIgM) induced rapid movement of CD22 to the cell surface in both Ramos and Daudi B cells, with a 50 to 100% increase in surface expression observed within 5 min of stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in CD22 surface expression was specific in that CD19 expression was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both cell surface and intracellular CD22 were directed toward the site of sIgM stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor bis(maltolato)oxovanadium(IV) also increased CD22 surface expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> tyrphostin A10 inhibited CD22 movement at concentrations that inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22 and other cellular proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the B cell lines, mature peripheral blood B cells contained very little intracellular CD22 and showed no significant increase in surface expression following sIgM stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rapid directed movement of intracellular CD22 provides a new mechanism to dynamically regulate Ag receptor signaling, as well as CD22-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
