<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV gene products associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latency, including latent membrane protein (LMP) and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2), are expressed in these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have found that transfection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three of these cell lines by electroporation in both the presence and the absence of foreign DNA resulted in a marked decrease in expression of the endogenous EBV gene encoding LMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An analysis of this response in Raji cells revealed that the level of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of this gene was decreased transiently and returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels by 7 days after transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of LMP protein was also reduced after transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference in survival was detected in electroporated versus unperturbed Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding a modulator of the LMP gene, EBNA-2, was unchanged by electroporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the level of another EBV transcript, BHLF-I, was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of electroporation could not be attributed to flux of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>, K+, or <z:chebi fb="193" ids="17996">Cl-</z:chebi> ions across the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of LMP in several lymphoblastoid cell lines was unaffected by electroporation </plain></SENT>
