<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously identified an LMP1 regulatory region (LRS) 5' of the LMP1 gene (+40 to -634) and analyzed its role in transcription initiation in the EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line DG 75 (FÃ¥hraeus et al., 1990a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> dependence of LMP1 gene regulation we have now compared the activity of positive and negative cis-acting LRS elements in cell lines of B lymphoid and epithelial cell origin in the presence and absence of the virus-encoded nuclear antigen EBNA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show that reporter plasmids that contain only the -54/+40 region of LRS are active in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the previously identified negative cis-elements in the -144/-54 region were found to suppress promoter activity independent of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBNA2 was able to override the effect of the negative elements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lines of B-cell origin, whereas it had no effect in epithelial lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive effect of EBNA2 was mediated by cis-acting elements in the -214/-144-bp region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six tested cell lines of epithelial origin, reporter plasmids that carried the full-length LRS were active, independent of EBNA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The LMP1 promoter in these constructs was activated by the concerted action of EBNA2-independent, positive elements in the -214/-144 and -324/-214 positions that counteracted the effect of the negative LRS elements </plain></SENT>
