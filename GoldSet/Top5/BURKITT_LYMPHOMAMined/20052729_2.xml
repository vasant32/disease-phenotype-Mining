<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> has been associated with Richter transformation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A direct isothermal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> amplification method was developed for detection of EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcriptional activity in the peripheral blood of 135 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> patients and 98 hematologically healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EBV LMP1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts were found in 19 of 135 (14%) of the CLL cases, but only 1% of the healthy controls (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 23 solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> patients tested negative for EBV LMP1 transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a later cohort of patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 4 of 7 patients with Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had EBV LMP1 detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a preliminary analysis, outcome data were available for 88 of the 135 patients with CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBV LMP1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> positivity was associated with a significantly increased degree of histologically demonstrated bone marrow involvement by CLL (P = .003, Mann-Whitney U test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EBV LMP1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcriptional activity was observed in a significant proportion of CLL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transcription of the EBV LMP1, a late gene with known transforming potential in vitro, suggests that EBV activation plays a role in CLL disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, EBV LMP1 expression in CLL patients may be a factor involved in the genesis of refractory disease </plain></SENT>
