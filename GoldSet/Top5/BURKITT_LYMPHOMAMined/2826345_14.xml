<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Studies were made to determine whether freshly isolated monocytes from healthy donors could influence the induction of lymphokine (IL-2)-activated killer (LAK) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Highly purified lymphocytes (greater than 99%) and monocytes (greater than 90%) were isolated by counter-flow centrifugal elutriation from peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes incubated for 4 days with IL-2 showed significant LAK activity against natural killer (NK) cell-resistant target (Daudi) cells, whereas monocytes treated for 4 days with IL-2 and/or IFN-gamma were not cytotoxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under the experimental conditions used, addition of monocytes to the lymphocyte cultures resulted in significant augmentation of the LAK activity, depending on the density of monocytes added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, monocytes stimulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) markedly suppressed LAK activity induced by IL-2, depending on the dose of LPS added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar up- and down-regulations of LAK cell induction by monocytes were observed with 4 lines of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> cells as targets for LAK activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although supernatants from untreated monocytes did not increase LAK induction, supernatants from LPS-stimulated monocytes suppressed LAK induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The regulatory role of monocytes could not be replaced by the addition of exogenous interleukin I (IL-I) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">Prostaglandin</z:chebi> E did not seem to play a regulatory role, since addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> did not affect the regulation of LAK cell induction by monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results clearly indicate that human monocytes may cause up- or down-regulation of the expression of IL-2-induced LAK activity, depending on their functional state </plain></SENT>
