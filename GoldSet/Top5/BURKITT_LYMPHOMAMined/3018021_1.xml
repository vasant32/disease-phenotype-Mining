<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed a method that permits the use of human polyclonal serum to immunoprecipitate BamH1-K EBNA(EBNA1) from EBV transformed cell lines and from cells transfected with an expression vector containing the Bam K region of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum from healthy seropositive donors is preabsorbed once with lysate of EBV-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, then fractionated by gel filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main IgG fraction is then used for the immunoprecipitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitated material is visualized by immunoblotting using the same serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two proteins with apparent molecular weights of 74 and 62 kD are specifically precipitated from extracts of B95-8 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several proteins are immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with the Bam K containing vector, the apparent molecular weights of the 4 major bands are 74, 68, 62 and 57 kD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Labelling of transfected cells with [3H]glycine and [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>]orthophosphate shows that the 74 and 62 kD proteins can be labelled with both isotopes </plain></SENT>
