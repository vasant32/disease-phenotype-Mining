<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To analyse the immunophenotype of leukaemic cells in a group of children diagnosed of lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in order to assess the frequency of the different immunologic subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the period comprised between APR 1987 and MAR 1995, 402 Mexican children were studied in a prospective way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional immunological markers were used, either associated to or specific for B, T, myelo-monocytic or megakaryocytic-platelet cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five major immunologic subtypes were disclosed, showing a series of specific surface markers: null-ALL, 5%; early pre-B, 7.5%; common, 74.6%; B-cell, 3.5%, and T-cell, 9.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A net predominance of B-cell precursor CD10- ALL was found in children under one year of age, and of CD10+ B-cells beyond that age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although there was only slight predominance of male sex, the prevalence of B and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TALL</z:e> in males was not confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the incidence of the different immunologic subtypes of lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> and their distribution according to age and sex are closely similar to those reported among Caucasians in other parts of the world </plain></SENT>
