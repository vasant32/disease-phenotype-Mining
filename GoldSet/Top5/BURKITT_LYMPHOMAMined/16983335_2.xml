<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bcl-X(L) expression is rapidly induced by a wide range of survival signals and many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells constitutively express high levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Bcl-X gene has a complex organization with multiple promoters giving rise to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> with alternate 5' non-coding exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we have investigated the mechanisms that control basal and induced expression of Bcl-X(L) in B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antisense experiments demonstrated that Bcl-X(L) was essential for survival of Akata6 B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> containing the IB Bcl-X non-coding exon, derived from the distal 1B promoter, correlated with basal expression of Bcl-X(L) in primary malignant B cells and this promoter was highly active in B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The activity of this promoter was largely dependent on a single Ets binding site and Ets family proteins were bound at this promoter in intact cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD40 ligand (CD40L)-induced cell survival was associated with increased Bcl-X(L) expression and accumulation of exon IA-containing <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, derived from the proximal 1A promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibition prevented induction of Bcl-X(L) protein and exon IA-containing <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> by CD40L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the distal Bcl-X 1B promoter plays a critical role in driving constitutive expression-mediated via Ets family proteins in malignant B cells, whereas NF-kappaB plays a central role in the induction of Bcl-X(L) in response to CD40 signalling via the proximal 1A promoter </plain></SENT>
