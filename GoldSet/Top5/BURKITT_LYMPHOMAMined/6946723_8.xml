<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 65 out of 66 lines derived from people without lymphoreticular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> the enzyme was very active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lines established from 35 individuals with various forms of lymphoreticular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> were also examined, including in some cases more than 1 line derived from the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases where the cell line was thought to be derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells MEs was active, but in 27 out of 29 lines thought to be derived from malignant cells (from 25 patients) MEs was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the case of two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_339'>lymphatic leukaemia</z:mpath> '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>' lines active for malic enzyme, and 'leukaemic' lines lacking malic enzyme, had been cultured from the same individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preliminary investigations of the lack of malic enzyme in somatic cell hybrids derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> cell lines are compatible with an alteration at the level of the structural locus MEs on chromosome 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the restoration of MEs activity in one line by fusion with mouse <z:mpath ids='MPATH_321'>teratocarcinoma</z:mpath> cells suggests that the alteration may be of a regulatory nature </plain></SENT>
