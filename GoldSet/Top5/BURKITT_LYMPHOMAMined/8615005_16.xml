<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the distribution of putative receptors for papillomavirus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) capsid proteins on various cell types, using either Hexahis HPV6b L1 fusion protein or synthetic HPV6b virus-like particles (VLPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific, saturable binding of VLPs to CV-1 cells was demonstrated using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>-labeled VLPs, with an average receptor number of 1 x 10(4)/cell and a binding affinity constant (Ka) of 4 x 10(7) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VLP binding was quantitated by flow cytometry using a monoclonal antibody to the L1 capsid protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intense staining of epithelial and mesenchymal cells was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some immature bone marrow-derived cells bound VLPs weakly, while the majority of B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells demonstrated no binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binding to 12 of 16 VLP receptor positive cell lines was abolished by trypsin pretreatment of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Removal of cellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> or O-linked <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> separately did not affect VLP binding, which was enhanced about 25% when cells were pretreated with both neuraminidase and O-glycosidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Culture of cells with sufficient tunicamycin to inhibit Concanavalin A binding did not diminish the binding of VLPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Denatured L1 protein, either from VLPs or expressed from Escherichia coli as a Hexahis fusion protein, bound to a trypsin-resistant structure on a range of cell types and did not block the binding of VLPs to cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dual-fluorescence assay with a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line BL72 demonstrated that Hexahis L1 protein and VLPs bind to separate cell surface molecules on BL72 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the first binding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> virus to cells is via a widely distributed membrane protein receptor(s) and that subsequent processing of particles may involve other non-trypsin-sensitive structure(s) also displayed on the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
