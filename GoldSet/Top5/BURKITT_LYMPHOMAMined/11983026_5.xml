<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: 5-AzaCytidine (AzaC) is a DNA demethylating drugs that has been shown to inhibit cell growth and to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Induced expression of the galectin1 (Gal1) protein, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24163">galactoside</z:chebi>-binding protein distributed widely in immune cells, has been described in cultured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e>-derived cells treated with AzaC and this event may have a role in the effect of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of AzaC and Gal1 on human lymphoid B <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cells phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effect of AzaC and Gal1 on cell growth and phenotype was determined on the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BL36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An immunocytochemical analysis for detection of Gal1 protein expression was performed in AzaC-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate the direct effects of Gal1, recombinant Gal1 was added to cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment of lymphoid B cells with AzaC results in: i) a decrease in cell growth with an arrest of the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase, ii) phenotypic changes consistent with a differentiated phenotype, and iii) the expression of p16, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene whose expression was dependent of its promoter demethylation, and of Gal1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A targeting of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> 1 to the plasma membrane follows its cytosolic expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To determine which of the effects of AzaC might be secondary to the induction of Gal1, recombinant Gal1 was added to BL36 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treated cells displayed growth inhibition and phenotypic changes consistent with a commitment toward differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Altered cell growth and expression of the cell surface plasma cell antigen, CD138 are detectable in BL36 cells treated by AzaC as well as by Gal1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It seems that AzaC-induced Gal1 expression and consequent binding of Gal1 on its cell membrane receptor may be, in part, involved in AzaC-induced plasmacytic differentiation </plain></SENT>
