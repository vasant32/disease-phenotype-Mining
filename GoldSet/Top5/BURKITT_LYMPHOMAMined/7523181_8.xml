<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently showed that recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) maintained the viability of human neutrophils in incubation for up to 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known whether rhG-CSF can enhance neutrophil survival in in vivo situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify this issue, we investigated neutrophil survival in vitro following in vivo injection of rhG-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils were obtained from 4 pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and healthy adult volunteers before and after rhG-CSF administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils obtained before rhG-CSF treatment started to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after 24 h of incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the survival of neutrophils drawn after rhG-CSF administration increased by approximately 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, the appearance of typical ladder-like DNA fragmentation was delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such an increase in neutrophil survival was inhibited by co-incubation with either H 7 (10 mumol/l) or H 8 (20 mumol/l), which worked as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37700">protein kinase C inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although our study did not measure neutrophil survival in vivo directly, it provides us with further evidence that rhG-CSF may function to prolong neutrophil life expectancy in vivo </plain></SENT>
