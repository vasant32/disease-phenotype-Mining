<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sixteen lymphoid cell lines were derived from patients with undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of Burkitt's or non-Burkitt's type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were obtained directly from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsies, from serous effusions, or from bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 10 of the cell lines, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen (EBNA) was undetectable; the remaining 6 lines were EBNA-positive (EB-pos) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 16 lines, 15 were aneuploid, with detectable chromosome "14q+ markers (11 had +8;14 translocations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These 15 lines, which included the EBNA-negative (EB-neg) lines, were believed to be of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining line consisted predominantly of diploid cells derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes, but some cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> origin were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four EB-pos cell lines derived from EB-neg <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had an aneuploid karyotype consistent with an origin from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (including no.8;14 translocation in two), which suggested that either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were infected with EBV in vitro or a tiny fraction of EB-pos <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (or potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells) present in vivo gave rise to the predominant cell of the line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EB-neg B-cell lines and EB-pos cell lines established from undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> differed greatly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EB-neg lines had consistently smaller electronic mean cell volumes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1410927" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">narrow-angle</z:e> light scatter than did EB-pos lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding correlated with a lower nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio in EB-pos lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EB-neg lines also had higher saturation cell densities than did EB-pos lines under standard culture conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data indicate either that EBV influences the morphologic and physiologic characteristics of lymphoid cell lines or that EB-neg B-cell lines and EB-pos cell lines are derived ultimately from different lymphocyte subpopulations or that both may apply </plain></SENT>
