<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether the growth inhibition by IFN could be in part due to a change in receptors for insulin or transferrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells treated for at least 2 days with 100 units/ml of IFN-alpha 2 bound less 125I-insulin and after 3 days of treatment this binding was reduced by more than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No change in the binding of 125I-transferrin was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with IFN of Raji cells, which are resistant to growth inhibition by IFN, resulted in a similar decrease in 125I-insulin binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Growth inhibition of Daudi cells by serum deprivation had no effect on 125I-insulin binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the IFN-induced loss of insulin binding sites is not a consequence of growth inhibition </plain></SENT>
