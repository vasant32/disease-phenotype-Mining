<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IgG antibodies to EBV-capsid antigen (VCA) and EBV-associated nuclear antigen, often at high titres, were found in 29 of these patients, of whom 20 also had IgA antibody to VCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antibody level to early antigen complex (R and D) rose in 19 patients, of whom 18 had antibody to the R component alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The abnormal patterns of EBV antibodies persisted for 3-14 months during and after the illness in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> may be important in the pathogenesis of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011850'>parotitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
