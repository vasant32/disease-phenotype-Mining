<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> with the typical rcpt(12;15) chromosome translocation the c-myc oncogene is juxtaposed to one of the heavy chain genes in a head-to-head orientation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the relative orientations of the c-myc locus and the Ig heavy chain gene cluster on the corresponding mouse chromosomes had not been settled, it was not known whether the rearranged c-myc gene is transposed to chromosome 12 or remains on chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To decide which of the two alternatives is correct, we separated the translocation chromosomes by fluorescence-activated chromosome sorting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The separated chromosomal fractions were hybridized with myc-specific DNA probes corresponding to the first or second/third exons in a chromosome spot assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results presented here indicate that the c-myc gene in mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> carrying the typical translocation, as in the human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> analogous translocation, transposes to the chromosome carrying the Ig heavy chain locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results also establish the orientations of the Ig heavy chain locus and the c-myc locus on their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes </plain></SENT>
