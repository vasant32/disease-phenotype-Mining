<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By utilizing an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line (BJAB) and several EBV-positive sub-lines derived from it by in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, it has been shown previously that the presence of the EBV genome in this B cell line is reversibly associated with deregulation of MYC expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the decline in the level of MYC transcripts observed in the EBV-negative BJAB line as cells approach stationary phase of growth is abrogated in the presence of the virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the studies described herein, the mechanism of deregulation of MYC in EBV-converted BJAB cells was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the presence of EBV in BJAB cells was not associated with changes in the rate of transcription from exons I, II or III of MYC as cells approached stationary phase of growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the stability of MYC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was altered in EBV-positive BJAB cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the half-life of MYC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increased from less than 36 to greater than 70 min in EBV-positive BJAB lines as cells progressed from early to late exponential phase of growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This alteration in stability of MYC transcripts was reversibly associated with the presence of the virus, since an EBV-negative <z:mp ids='MP_0003171'>revertant</z:mp> BJAB line did not display an increase in stability of MYC transcripts in late exponential phase of growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, progression from early to late exponential phase of growth in two EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid lines derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B cells was also associated with prolongation of the half-life of MYC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
