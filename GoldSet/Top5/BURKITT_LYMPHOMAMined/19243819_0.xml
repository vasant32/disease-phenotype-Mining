<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By examination on various childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissues, we found that granulysin level was especially high in systemic anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e>) cases, whereas no close correlation with the expression of CD96, a marker for activated T and NK cells, was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrated that both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> cells in biopsy specimens and cell lines established from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> express granulysin, indicating some correlation of granulysin with biological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
