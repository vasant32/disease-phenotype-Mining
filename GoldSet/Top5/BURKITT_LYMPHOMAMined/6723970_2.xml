<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The failure of cell growth has been shown to be associated with impaired processing and decreased stability of newly replicated DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because there is a close relationship between DNA replication and protein synthesis we have measured protein synthesis in intact Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein synthesis declined steadily between 24 and 96 h after interferon treatment to a value which is only 20-30% of the rate in control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enzyme 2',5'-oligo(A) synthetase is induced but our data do not support a role for the 2',5'-oligo(A)-activated ribonuclease in the control of translation in this system </plain></SENT>
