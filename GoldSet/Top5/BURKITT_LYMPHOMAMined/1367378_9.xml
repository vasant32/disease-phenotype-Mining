<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An immunoglobulin production stimulating factor (IPSF) in human lymphoblastoid Namalwa cells was purified by the serial use of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> fractionation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography and gel filtration, and named IPSF-II alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IPSF-II alpha was estimated as a 112 KD protein composed of a 40 KD <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> and two 36 KD <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 36 KD protein extracted from <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel showed IPSF activity, but not the 40 KD protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IPSF activity was reasonably stable in alkaline but unstable in acidic solution and heat-unstable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a serum-free medium, IPSF-II alpha stimulated IgM production of human-human and mouse-mouse hybridomas 4-15 and 2-fold, respectively, although its growth stimulatory effect on hybridomas was negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The factor did not stimulate IgG production in either human or mouse hybridomas in the same serum-free medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that IPSF-II alpha was a new cellular factor for stimulating IgM productivity of hybridomas </plain></SENT>
