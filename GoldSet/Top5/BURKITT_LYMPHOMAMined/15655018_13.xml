<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper presents health outcomes and associated socioeconomic factors of 41 children admitted to a tertiary care institution in south-east Nigeria with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) between 1987 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> responds well to chemotherapy and does not pose a significant threat to health in industrialized nations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in resource-poor settings where it is endemic, socioeconomic factors significantly affect access to care for affected children, making this readily treatable condition a cause of considerable distress and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in affected children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Half of the children reported in this paper presented with late stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although laboratory facilities were available, they were not accessible to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nearly a quarter of parents of these children could not afford the cost of confirmatory tests, and about a fifth (n = 8; 19.5%) of the children received no chemotherapy because of their parents' inability to pay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 21 of 41 children (51.2%) remained on treatment long enough (at least 12 weeks) to enable them to be confirmed either as short-term cure (n = 9; 64.3%), or as early relapse (n = 2; 4.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Owing to financial constraint, 13 of the parents (31.7%) withdrew their children against medical advice (n = 7; 17.1%) or left the hospital (n = 6; 14.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To address the challenge posed by these factors, we call for the establishment of a regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> programme in Africa to help establish a critical mass of resources (human and material) to facilitate the development of an effective and accessible control programme in the region </plain></SENT>
