<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 21 hybrid clones were isolated and karyotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> clones contained a near complete set of Chinese hamster chromosomes and 1 to 5 human chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human chromosome 14 present in the hybrid cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clones; and was the only human chromosome retained in 10 clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of human chromosome 14 in hybrids was further confirmed by the demonstration of human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> phosphorylase activity in the hybrid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one hybrid clone was positive for EBNA, the Epstein-Barr virus antigen present in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that human chromosome 14 contains the necessary information for the K12 cells to overcome their G1 defect in the cell cycle and grow at non-permissive temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study lends strong support to the possibility that different steps in the G1 phase of the cell cycle are controlled by genes located on different chromosomes </plain></SENT>
