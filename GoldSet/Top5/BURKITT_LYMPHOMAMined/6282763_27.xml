<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A prospective epidemiological study was carried out in the West Nile District of Uganda from 1972 to 1979 in order to investigate the aetiological role of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By 1976, fourteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases had been detected among the 42,000 children originally bled in the study area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Testing of sera from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> candidates and neighbourhood controls showed that children who develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> later have EBV/VCA titres several dilutions higher than their age- and sex-matched neighbours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This appearance of a strong EBV activity long before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> development was taken as evidence of a causal role of EBV in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to add to the unique material of pre-bled <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> detection was continued up to March 1979 when field work became impossible in Uganda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two additional pre-bled <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases were found during this extension of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The serological and virological evaluation of these additional cases showed that the EBV/VCA titres, but not the EA and EBNA titres, were about two dilutions higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> candidates than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hybridization assays showed that both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> contained EBV/DNA in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These additional results thus confirm the findings in the first 14 cases and strengthen the epidemiological evidence for a causal role of the EBV in endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
