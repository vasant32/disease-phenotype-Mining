<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied possible genomic changes occurring in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus type 1 (HSV-1) during long-term cell culture which served as a model system for persistence and latency studies as introduced earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen HSV-1 reisolates were isolated from persistently productive HSV-1 (strains F and AK)-infected Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines Raji and BJAB at four different times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were roughly characterized in plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, plaque size, and infectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> reisolate DNAs revealed deletions and insertions of up to 1,150 base pairs in fragments BamHI-B, -E, -F, -J, -V, -X, and in the L-terminal and junction fragments S and K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were confirmed by additional restriction enzyme analyses and DNA sequencing of selected genomic regions between map units 0.642-0.650, 0.763-0.778 and 0.887-0.934 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a progressive increase in genomic variability over a three-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, changes in DNA fragment size occurred at different rates, with some reisolates showing stability over several months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The selective pressure for HSV-1 (F and AK) genomic changes was stronger in Raji than in BJAB cells, and stronger for F than for AK strain </plain></SENT>
