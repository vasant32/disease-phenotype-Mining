<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are also found in quite low percentage in peripheral blood of healthy HTLV carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it has become difficult to discriminate smoldering ATL having only abnormal lymphocytes from a healthy human T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus (HTLV) carrier only by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and serology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that patients with smoldering ATL with visceral organ involvement such as skin or lung lesions had much higher titer (about 1 : 1,000) of anti-HTLV antibodies than those with other subtypes of ATL (about 1 : 250); the difference was highly significant (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the period of survival of patients with smoldering ATL having antibody with high titer was much longer than that of patients with other subtypes of ATL, suggesting the role of a host immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four cases of HTLV-negative ATL were found to have the same chromosomal abnormality as that has been seen in HTLV-positive typical ATL; the situation was quite similar to Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since it has been considered that HTLV does not include oncogenes, a common oncogenic mechanism, ATL specific cellular oncogenes, might exist: they might be activated by HTLV or a mechanism other than a virus </plain></SENT>
