<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Majority of the fathers were farmers, labourers or petty traders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> children were, as a group, significantly lighter in weight and shorter than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that although the weights were probably adversely affected by the illness itself, the shorter heights which were most likely present before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the illness, indicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> undernutrition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This, together with a low level of immunization would predispose the children to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>frequent infections</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>Frequent infections</z:hpo> would thus condition the reticuloendothelial system to be more susceptible to the lymphoproliferative properties of the EB virus, resulting in malignant changes such as Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
