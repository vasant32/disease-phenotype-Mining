<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas no deletions or insertions were found in naive B cells, approximately 4% of in-frame and &gt;40% of out-of-frame rearrangements of GC B cells harbored deletions and/or insertions of variable length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern of deletions/insertions and their restriction to mutated V genes strongly suggests that they result from somatic hypermutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deletions and insertions account for approximately 6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> introduced into rearranged VH region genes of GC B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These deletions/insertions seem to be the main cause for the generation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heavy chain disease</z:e> proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it appears that several types of oncogene translocations (like c-myc translocations in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) occur as a byproduct of somatic hypermutation within the GC-and not during V(D)J recombination in the bone marrow as previously thought </plain></SENT>
