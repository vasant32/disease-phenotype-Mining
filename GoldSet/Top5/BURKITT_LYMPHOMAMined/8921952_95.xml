<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD9, CD63, CD81, and CD82 are <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> of unknown function which belong to the tetraspan superfamily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These molecules have short cytoplasmic sequences, four transmembrane domains and two unequal extracellular regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that these molecules are associated with each other on cell surface and with other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> such as very late antigen (VLA) integrins and HLA-DR antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the VLA integrins and HLA-DR antigens were also found to be associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interactions of these molecules were analyzed by transfection experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is demonstrated that overexpression of CD9 antigen in Raji cells leads to a lower efficiency of precipitation of CD81 and CD82, suggesting a direct interaction between these molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these cells, the co-precipitation of CD81 and CD82 was not modified, suggesting that these tetraspans did not compete for association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in COS-7 cells, transfection of both CD81 and CD82 led to a marked reduction of the number of CD9/CD81 or CD9/CD82 complexes compared to single-transfected cells, and this was associated with the appearance of CD81/CD82 complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this cellular system, CD9 competes with CD81 and CD82 for association with the other tetraspan proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, the tetraspans do not compete for the association with integrins or HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Indeed, when CD9 was expressed in Raji cells, it was incorporated into the pre-existing complexes of these molecules with CD81 and CD82 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest the existence of a tetraspan network which, by connecting several molecules, may organize the positioning of cell surface proteins and play a role in signal transduction, cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, and motility </plain></SENT>
