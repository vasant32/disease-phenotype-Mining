<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To develop an immunotoxin for the treatment of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, we constructed several candidate conjugates with RFB4, a B-cell specific anti-CD22 IgG1, and truncated forms of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The four versions of PE included PE35 and PE35KDEL, which were linked to RFB4 via a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bond, and PE38 and PE38KDEL, which were linked via a thioether bond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PE35 truncated forms, which are fully active in <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> ribosylation and lack receptor binding sequences, do not require intracellular proteolytic cleavage in order to be active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PE35KDEL has the consensus endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, KDEL, replacing the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> PE C-terminal sequence, REDLK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PE38 forms retain <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of domain II and therefore require cleavage to be active within cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity experiments on CD22-positive cell lines revealed that the PE35 conjugates were more active than the PE38 versions and the presence of the KDEL sequence generally enhanced toxicity by 5-10-fold compared to that of REDLK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The RFB4-PE35KDEL immunotoxin was most active in cytotoxicity assays against Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines such as Daudi and CA46 (IC50 = 0.2 ng/mL) and displayed little cytotoxicity toward human vascular endothelial cells (IC50 &gt; 20 micrograms/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results of experiments conducted in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice showed that both RFB4-PE35KDEL and RFB4-PE35 could inhibit the development of subcutaneous CA46 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
