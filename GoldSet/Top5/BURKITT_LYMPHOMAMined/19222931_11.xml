<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> 12.5 mg and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> 12.5 mg were administered on days 1, 8, 18 and 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">Allopurinol</z:chebi> was commenced before chemotherapy, and a high urinary output was maintained to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: St Jude stage distribution was stage I, 1; II, 9; III, 24; and IV, 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An equal number (70%) presented with abdominal and facial disease, and 15% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (50%) were below the 5th NCHS centile for weight-for-age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients died during treatment, three had chemotherapy-resistant disease and 35 (88%) achieved complete clinical remission by day 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sixteen required antibiotic treatment for presumed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and nine received a blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
