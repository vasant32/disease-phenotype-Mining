<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The growth-inhibitory effects of the tanshinones on K562 and Raji cells were assessed using a modified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay; the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing effects were assessed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The changes in cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were observed using an inverted phase-contrast microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> results revealed that these tanshinones inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IC50 values of dihydrotanshinone, tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, and cryptotanshinone for K562 cells were 3.50, 13.52, 19.32, and 47.52 μmol/l at 24 h; 1.36, 4.70, 5.67, and 22.72 μmol/l at 48 h; and 1.15, 1.59, 2.82, and 19.53 μmol/l at 72 h, and the values for Raji cells were 3.30, 4.37, 12.92, and 52.36 μmol/l at 24 h; 1.55, 1.71, 6.54, and 25.45 μmol/l at 48 h; and 1.07, 1.38, 1.89, and 18.47 μmol/l at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that these tanshinones induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of K562 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and dihydrotanshinone as well as tanshinone I were more potent than tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some noticeable apoptotic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> could be observed by fluorescence microscopy on tanshinones-treated Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these tanshinones caused growth inhibition and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848852,C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancy</z:e> cell lines, with dihydrotanshinone being the most potent, followed by tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, and cryptotanshinone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that the structure of aromatic ring A enhanced the cytotoxicity and the structure of ring C may have contributed to the cytotoxicity, but the mechanisms need to be further investigated </plain></SENT>
