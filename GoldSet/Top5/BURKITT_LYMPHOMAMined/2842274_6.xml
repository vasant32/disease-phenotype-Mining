<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type A virus hybridizes with probes from B95-8 or M-<z:chebi fb="81" ids="2365,53554">ABA</z:chebi> viruses and the B type virus with probes from the Jijoye virus strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The substituted region in EBV type B codes for a different, but related EBNA2 antigen, named EBNA2B as opposed to EBNA2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, previously typed according to the EBV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomes they carry, as well as some matching lymphoblastoid cell lines were examined by immunoblotting for the expression of both EBNA1 and EBNA2 antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variation in the molecular weight of EBNA1 indicated that both A and B virus types contained a variety of different virus isolates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBNA2A was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lines carrying A type <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomes, but was not observed in any of the lines harboring B type virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBNA2B was identified in 4 of 10 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines carrying EBV type B </plain></SENT>
