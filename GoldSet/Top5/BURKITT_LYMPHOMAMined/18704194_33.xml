<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004812'>pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B-ALL</z:e>) are caused by the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-encoded BCR-ABL oncogene, and these tend to have a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT pathway reduce BCR-ABL-mediated transformation in vitro; however, the specific PI3K isoforms involved are poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a murine model of Ph+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B-ALL</z:e>, we found that deletion of both Pik3r1 and Pik3r2, genes encoding class IA PI3K regulatory isoforms, severely impaired transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BCR-ABL-dependent pre/pro-B cell lines could be established at low frequency from progenitors that lacked these genes, but the cells were smaller, proliferated more slowly, and failed to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cell lines displayed nearly undetectable PI3K signaling function and were resistant to the PI3K inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, they maintained activation of mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) and were more sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> caused feedback activation of AKT in WT cell lines but not PI3K-deficient lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A dual inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR, PI-103, was more effective than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> at suppressing proliferation of mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B-ALL</z:e> and human CD19+CD34+)Ph+ ALL <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells treated with the ABL kinase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide mechanistic insights into PI3K dependency in oncogenic networks and provide a rationale for targeting class IA PI3K, alone or together with mTOR, in the treatment of Ph+ ALL </plain></SENT>
