<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> membrane protein (LMP) is likely to be an important mediator of EBV-induced cell proliferation, since it is one of the few proteins encoded by the virus in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> and since production of this protein in Rat-1 cells results in their conversion to a fully transformed phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LMP was previously noted to localize to patches at the cell periphery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper we examine the basis of LMP patching in EBV-infected, transformed lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that LMP is associated with the cytoskeletal protein vimentin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although LMP is fully soluble in isotonic <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100 buffer, only 50% of it is extracted from cells in this solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rest remains bound to the cytoskeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LMP undergoes phosphorylation, and phosphorylated LMP is preferentially associated with the cytoskeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As judged by both immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, the vimentin network in EBV-transformed lymphocytes or EBV-infected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> lymphocytes is abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vimentin and LMP often colocalize in a single patch near the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In response to Colcemid treatment of EBV-infected cells, vimentin reorganizes into perinuclear rings, as it does in uninfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LMP is associated with these perinuclear rings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vimentin (or a vimentin-associated protein) may be a transducer of an LMP transmembrane effect in lymphoproliferation </plain></SENT>
