<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vivo survival signals from the extracellular environment may also contribute to drug resistance and may act with Bcl-2 to promote long-term cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ligation of CD40 on B-lymphocytes in germinal centers (GCs) can suppress <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> or anti-IgM in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We asked whether a combination of Bcl-2 expression and the provision of a culture environment that mimicked that of the GC [CD40 ligation and interleukin 4 (IL-4)] could increase the ability of B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to resist drug-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell line transfected with either human bcl-2 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-bcl-2) or control plasmid (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-Sv2) was used to examine the effects of Bcl-2 overexpression on the cellular response and long-term survival after treatment with the DNA-alkylating drug <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> (CMB) in the presence or absence of CD40 ligation and IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of 20 microM CMB completely prevented cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was associated with an increase in p53 protein levels within 24 h, without an elevation in p21, Bax, or Mdm2 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyses of cell cycle distribution and of cyclin B expression demonstrated that both cell lines arrested at G2/M, where they died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty % of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-Sv2 cells died within 2 days, whereas 50% cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was not observed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-bcl-2 cultures until 6 days had passed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cross-linking of CD40 with a monoclonal antibody elevated Bcl-xL protein levels by 3 h and also provided a delay in CMB-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ninety-six h after the addition of 20 microM CMB, 78% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-Sv2 cells were apoptotic, whereas ligation of CD40 on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-Sv2 cells reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells to 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Bcl-2 (in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-bcl-2 cells) <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>reduced apoptosis</z:mp> to 41% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, when the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-bcl-2 cells were treated with CMB together with ligation of CD40, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was reduced further to only 17% at 96 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The Bcl-2-mediated delay in the execution of CMB-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> did not translate significantly to increased clonogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the provision of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-Sv2 cells with an ability to interact with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, CD40 ligation, and IL-4 significantly increased clonogenic survival, and this was improved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-bcl-2 cells exposed to these GC-derived signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that the kinetics of drug-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> can be modulated by Bcl-2 as well as by IL-4, vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, and CD40 ligation, the latter possibly involving the function of Bcl-xL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>That these factors appear to act together to enhance proliferative potential after DNA damage has important implications regarding the development of drug resistance in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and future strategies for improved chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
