<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As a key mediator of type I interferon (IFN) (IFN-alpha/beta) responses, IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) is essential to host immune defenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activation of IRF7 generally requires virus-induced C-terminal phosphorylation, which leads to its nuclear accumulation and activation of target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we use the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) oncoprotein LMP1, which activates IRF7, to identify factors involved in IRF7 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate for the first time that RIP activates IRF7 and that RIP and IRF7 interact under physiological conditions in EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that both RIP and IRF7 are ubiquitinated in these cells and that IRF7 preferentially interacts with ubiquitinated RIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RIP is required for full activation of IRF7 by LMP1, with LMP1 stimulating the ubiquitination of RIP and its interaction with IRF7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, LMP1 stimulates RIP-dependent K63-linked ubiquitination of IRF7, which regulates protein function rather than proteasomal degradation of proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that RIP may serve as a general activator of IRF7, responding to and transmitting the signals from various stimuli, and that ubiquitination may be a general mechanism for enhancing the activity of IRF7 </plain></SENT>
