<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five had underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> (HM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a case-control study, these five HM patients (cases) were compared to 10 autopsied HM patients without evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">zygomycosis</z:e> (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases and controls did not differ in underlying disease or in the degree of immunosuppression, as measured by duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> and number of platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, case-patients were more likely than controls to have been hospitalized during the construction of a hospital addition (p less than 0.02, Fisher's exact test [FET]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four (80%) of five HM patients autopsied during the period of construction had IA or IZ compared with one (5%) of 21 autopsied before construction began (p = 0.001, FET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that, in a population of comparably immunosuppressed patients, construction activity may represent an independent risk factor for IA or IZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hospitals caring for such patients should take precautions which minimize exposure of these patients to construction or renovation activity </plain></SENT>
