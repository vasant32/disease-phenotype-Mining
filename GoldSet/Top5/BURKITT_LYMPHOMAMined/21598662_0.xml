<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This virus plays an important role in the etiology of nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the parotid glands, gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphoproliferative syndromes [1, 2, 3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of drugs active against EBV remains very limited, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="465284">gancyclovir</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> are used in medical practice, so the search of new compounds active against EBV remains urgent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this work was to study antiEBV activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6032">isonicotinic acid</z:chebi> derivatives in the cultures of lymphoblastoid Raji cells, B95-8, Namalwa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indices of cytotoxicity (CC50) which amounted to 840, 1250 and 3000 microg/ml and the concentration of drugs, which inhibit the virus (IC50) reproduction is 0.1, 2.5 and 50 microg/ml, respectively, in cell cultures were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was detected, the drug 4-(n-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22744">benzyl</z:chebi>)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004">aminocarbonyl</z:chebi>-1-methylpyridinium <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16382">iodide</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>-1) had an ability to inhibit reproduction of the Epstein-Barr virus in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studied cells cultures </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It, respectively, influenced the decrease of their selectivity index, which was 8400 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>-1, 400 and 440--for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>-2 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest possible ways of further modification of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>-1 molecule to create highly specific inhibitors of Epstein-Barr virus </plain></SENT>
