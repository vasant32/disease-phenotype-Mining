<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is still not clear to what extent such adhesive contacts facilitate the process of immune recognition and target cell lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, work on the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) has suggested that down-regulation of one particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule, the lymphocyte function-associated antigen LFA-3, on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell surface is a key factor in allowing these target cells to escape EBV-specific T cell surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine this directly, we used a cDNA for the full-length transmembrane form of LFA-3 to construct a recombinant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042214" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vaccinia</z:e> virus (Vacc-LFA 3), which is capable of restoring surface LFA-3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines to levels as high as seen in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL); biochemical studies confirmed expression of the authentic N-glycosylated protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recombinant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042214" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vaccinia</z:e>-encoded LFA-3 was functional as an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule since <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells acutely infected with Vacc-LFA-3 then acquired the ability to form conjugates with activated T cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was no clear dependence upon LFA-3 when such <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines were tested as targets for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Firstly, LFA-3- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells could be killed by allospecific CTL recognizing HLA class I alloantigens, in some cases as efficiently as the corresponding LCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In other cases where lysis was slightly below that of the LCL, Vacc-LFA-3 infection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells increased lysis up to, but never beyond, LCL values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondly, we studied the sensitivity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> to EBV-specific HLA class I-restricted CTL using a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> target line which was LFA-3- but which expressed the same spectrum of EBV target proteins as an LCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This line was not recognized by appropriately HLA-matched effectors, even after restoration of LFA-3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the LFA-3 status of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells influences their conjugate forming ability in in vitro assays but not necessarily their sensitivity to immune T cell-mediated cytolysis </plain></SENT>
