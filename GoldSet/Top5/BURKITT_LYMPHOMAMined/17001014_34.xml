<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In many EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, however, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigen expression is more restricted, and the aetiological role of the virus is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For example, endemic Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) classically presents as a monoclonal, c-myc-translocation-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in which every cell carries EBV as an EBNA1-only (Latency I) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>; such homogeneity among EBV-positive cells, and the lack of EBV-negative comparators, hampers attempts to understand EBV's role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe an endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> that was unusually <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> at the single-cell level and, in early passage culture, yielded a range of cellular clones, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with the same c-myc translocation but differing in EBV status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rare EBV-negative cells were isolated alongside EBV-positive cells displaying one of three forms of restricted latency: (i) conventional Latency I expressing EBNA1 only from a WT virus genome, (ii) Wp-restricted latency expressing EBNAs 1, 3A, 3B, 3C, and -LP only from an EBNA2-deleted genome, and (iii) a previously undescribed EBNA2(+)/LMP1(-) latency in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six EBNAs are expressed again in the absence of the LMPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interclonal comparisons showed that each form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> was associated with a specific degree of protection from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our work suggests that EBV acts as an antiapoptotic rather than a growth-promoting agent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> by selecting among three transcriptional programs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which, unlike the full virus growth-transforming program, remain compatible with high c-myc expression </plain></SENT>
