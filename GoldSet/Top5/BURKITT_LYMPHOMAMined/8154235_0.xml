<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The number of receptors per cell expressed in each case did not correlate with the sensitivity of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> effect of IFN alpha-2b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the Scatchard analysis of the affinity of the IFN-receptor complex did correlate with this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Daudi cells, which expressed 1927 receptors/cells with a high affinity (Kd = 3.30 x 10(-10) M) were the most sensitive to the antiproliferative effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Growth inhibition was 30% with only 1.6pg/ml of IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HeLa cells expressed a mixture of high (Kd = 3.36 x 10(-10) M) and low (Kd = 3.21 x 10(-9) M) affinity binding sites and were also sensitive to the antiproliferative effect but less than Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HEp-2 and GL-5 cells, on the contrary, were very little sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of IFN and only expressed low affinity binding sites (Kd = 1.20 x 10(-8) M and Kd = 8.33 x 10(-9) M) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, IFN alpha-2b binding assays to peripheral blood lymphocytes from 8 healthy individuals were also carried out as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The values obtained were 433 +/- 166 receptors per cell and Kd = 3.68 2.66 x 10(-10) M.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
