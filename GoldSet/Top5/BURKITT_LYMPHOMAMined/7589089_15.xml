<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cross-linking the TCR with MHC class II molecules on the antigen-presenting cell by the superantigen leads to T cell activation that plays an essential role in pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent crystallographic data have resolved the structure of the complexes between HLA-DR1 and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0600327" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="TSS">toxic shock syndrome</z:e> toxin-1 (TSST-1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For TSST-1, these studies have revealed possible contact sites between the superantigen and the HLA-DR1-bound <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that TSST-1 binding is dependent on the MHC-II-associated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> by employing variants of T2 mutant cells deficient in loading of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> to MHC class II molecules as superantigen-presenting cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On HLA-DR3-transfected T2 cells, presentation of TSST-1, but not SEB, was dependent on HLA-DR3-associated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, although these superantigens can be recognized in the context of multiple MHC class II alleles and isotypes, they clearly bind to specific subsets of MHC molecules displaying appropriate <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
