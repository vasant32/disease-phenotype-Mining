<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (19 males and 5 females) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> underwent allo-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients had a median age of 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were eight cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), six cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), nine cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), and one case of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3-year overall survival rate was 22.5%, with a median survival time of 206 days in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 345 days in ALL, and 363 days in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was associated with a recovery of platelets of less than 30 days and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD) presence of less than grade II ( p=0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients died of transplantation-related diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our important problem is to decrease transplantation-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in allo-BMT during the non-remission stage, and longer survival can be expected with better pretreatment and prophylaxis for GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the selection of the source of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at an optimal time is considered to be another problem to be approached </plain></SENT>
