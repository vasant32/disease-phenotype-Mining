<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To compare the presentation and prognosis of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> (PWA) and in the general Italian population, a record linkage study was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fraction of NHLs attributable to HIV/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> was also estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information from the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> Registry (RAIDS) was linked with records from 13 cancer registries (CR), covering about 15% of the Italian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the period 1985--94, among PWA ages 15--49, 136 NHLs were identified (8% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHLs) and were compared with 1,481 concurrent incident NHL cases of the same age group among non-PWA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Percentages above 13% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHLs were registered in the northern areas of Genoa and Varese, i.e., the most heavily affected by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> epidemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between 1 year prior to and 3.5 years after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> diagnosis, PWA showed an overall standardised incidence ratio (SIR) for NHL of 302 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SIR was particularly high (394) within 3 months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> diagnosis and subsequently declined to 170 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SIR was somewhat higher in females (428) than in males (280) but similar among intravenous-drug users (299) and other HIV-transmission groups (309) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High-grade NHL, particularly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, were twice as frequent among PWA than non-PWA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, low-grade NHL were less frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Except for the high proportion of brain localisation, no clear difference emerged in the pattern of NHL presentation site in PWA compared with non-PWA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At variance with NHL in the general population, among PWA histological grade had little impact on survival, which overall appeared to be very poor (2-year survival: 10%; 95% confidence interval: 3%--17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our present linkage of RAIDS and CRs represents an efficient tool for the surveillance of trends in incidence and survival of NHL among PWA in Italy </plain></SENT>
