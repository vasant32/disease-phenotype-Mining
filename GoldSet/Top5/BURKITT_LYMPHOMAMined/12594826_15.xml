<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cross-linking of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) with an anti-IgM antibody has been shown to induce dramatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in type I Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the apoptotic mechanism triggered via BCR remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we reports a mechanism of BCR ligation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> involving protein phosphatase calcineurin and its specific substrate, transcriptional factor NF-AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In response to BCR cross-linking, endogenous calcineurin was rapidly activated, and this facilitated nuclear translocation of NF-ATc2, a subtype of NF-AT members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, nuclear-imported NF-ATc2 functioned pro-apoptotically in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of NF-ATc2 was efficiently blocked with FK506, which prevented its nuclear translocation through inactivation of calcineurin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, TR3 induction during BCR cross-linking was reduced by FK506 and the VIVIT <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, which is a highly selective inhibitor for NF-AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This strongly suggests that activation of NF-ATc2 by calcineurin is essential for TR3 recruitment, and that TR3 can be considered as a candidate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> effector in BCR-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, NF-ATc2 plays a crucial role in BCR-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in type IBL, providing greater insight into unique <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> characteristics through BCR signaling </plain></SENT>
