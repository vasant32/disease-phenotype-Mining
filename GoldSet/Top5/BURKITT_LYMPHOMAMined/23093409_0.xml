<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A novel lectin structure was found for a 17-kDa α-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4139">D-galactose</z:chebi>-binding lectin (termed "MytiLec") isolated from the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The complete primary structure of the lectin was determined by Edman degradation and mass spectrometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MytiLec was found to consist of 149 amino acids with a total molecular mass of 16,812.59 Da by Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, in good agreement with the calculated value of 16,823.22 Da </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MytiLec had an N terminus of acetylthreonine and a primary structure that was highly novel in comparison with those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known lectins in the structure database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> structure consisted of three tandem-repeat domains of ∼50 amino acids each having 45-52% homology with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frontal affinity chromatography technology indicated that MytiLec bound specifically to globotriose (Gb3; <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>α1-4Galβ1-4Glc), the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of globotriaosylceramide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MytiLec showed a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji cells (which have high surface expression of Gb3) but had no such effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> K562 cells (which do not express Gb3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic effect of MytiLec was specifically blocked by the co-presence of an α-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24163">galactoside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MytiLec treatment of Raji cells caused increased binding of anti-annexin V antibody and incorporation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi>, which are indicators of cell membrane inversion and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MytiLec is the first reported lectin having a primary structure with the highly novel triple tandem-repeat domain and showing transduction of apoptotic signaling against Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells by interaction with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi>-enriched microdomain containing Gb3 </plain></SENT>
