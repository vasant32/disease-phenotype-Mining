<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, recognition requires accessory molecules involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors previously have characterized an autologous, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specific CTL line that uses the gamma-delta TCR to recognize antigen in a nonclassical context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study was undertaken to identify novel accessory molecules involved in this unusual TCR-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A panel of monoclonal antibodies was generated against a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line and was screened for inhibition of autologous, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specific, cytolysis by a gamma-delta CTL line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proteins identified by these monoclonal antibodies were further characterized by fluorescent-activated cell sorter analysis, Western blot and immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three known (CD5, CD43, and CD11a/CD18) and three novel (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28435">BAM</z:chebi>-1, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28435">BAM</z:chebi>-2, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28435">BAM</z:chebi>-3) cell surface molecules involved in the gamma-delta CTL-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> interaction were identified and characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies and provides a preliminary characterization of three novel Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated molecules involved in the gamma-delta CTL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell interaction and demonstrates that CD5, CD43, and CD11a/CD18 are involved in this interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is likely that other unidentified accessory molecules are also involved in this and other effector cell-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Identification of such molecules may be useful in the design of new immunotherapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
