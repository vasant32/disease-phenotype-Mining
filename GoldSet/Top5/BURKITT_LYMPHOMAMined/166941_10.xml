<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBNA was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines (producer and non-producer) which carried the EBV-genome, while VCA and EA were present in producer lines only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the antigens were absent from a lymphoid cell line (MOLT-4) which lacked the EBV-genome, as well as from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells from peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The techniques demonstrated antigenic identity of the various antigens when prepared from different cell lines </plain></SENT>
