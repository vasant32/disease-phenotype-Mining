<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two monoclonal antibodies, anti-Ti1A and anti-Ti1B, were shown to define the clonally unique surface receptor on CT8III, a human cytolytic T lymphocyte specific for a class I major histocompatibility gene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present report, this surface structure was characterized and related to the 20-kilodalton (kDa) T3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> present on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mature human T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that the anti-clonotypic antibodies react with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> on a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-linked heterodimer of 49- and 43-kDa subunits exclusively expressed by CT8III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This structure is associated with T3 in the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar T3-associated 49/43-kDa molecules were detected on eight additional clones, although these did not express the determinant defined by anti-Ti1A or anti-Ti1B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By probing clones of differing specificities derived from the same donor with anti-T3, it was possible to compare these T3-associated heterodimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis indicated that the 49/43-kDa structures, but not the T3 molecules themselves, had isoelectric point variability and unique <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> maps after digestion with chymotrypsin or staphylococcal protease V8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings support the idea that the 49/43-kDa heterodimer contains the variable region of the T cell's antigen receptor structure </plain></SENT>
