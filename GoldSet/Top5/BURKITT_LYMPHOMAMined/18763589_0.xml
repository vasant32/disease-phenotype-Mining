<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 63 patients (40 females and 23 males aged 14 to 78 years, mean age 49 years) with primary diagnosis of gastric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079734" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphosarcoma</z:e> (GL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of them, 56 (89%) patients had diffuse large B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079734" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphosarcoma</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and 7 (11%) had gastric Berkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only detection of t(8;14) with rearrangement of c-myc gene provided accurate diagnosis of gastric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By the treatment <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> patients were divided into two groups: 44 patients of group 1 received polychemotherapy (PCT) according to CHOP scheme or in combination with radiotherapy and surgical treatment; 12 patients of group 2 were treated according to modified program mNHL-BFM-90, without surgical or radiation treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 7 patients with gastric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 5 patients received treatment according to a modified program mNHL-BFM-90 and 2 patients were given CHOP because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> misdiagnosis without cytogenetic detection of t(8;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall survival in group 1 was 73% in mean follow-up 61 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The survival depended only on initial factors of poor prognosis (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi>): <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size over 10 cm, Ann-Arbor stage higher than IE, B-symptoms, elevated level of LDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall survival of 18 gastric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> patients without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> reached 94%, of 26 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> - 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>Lethality</z:mp> due to side effects was 4% (2 patients), primary resistance was 14% (6 patients), recurrence arose in 9% (4 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall survival in group 2 was 100% in mean remission duration 18 months, was unrelated to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> (10 of 12 patients) but correlated with high toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>5 BL patients treated with a modified mNHL-BFM-90 program achieved remission (a mean follow-up at present is 1 to 50 months, mean 24 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>2 BL patients treated with CHOP died for a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Gastric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079734" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphosarcomas</z:e> are sensitive to chemotherapy, thereby PCT only is effective in most patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The modified program mNHL-BFM-90 can produce up to 100% complete long-term remissions in therapy of gastric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079734" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphosarcoma</z:e> in adults both in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A cytogenetic examination of c-myc gene rearrangement is obligatory before initiation of PCT of gastric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079734" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphosarcoma</z:e> </plain></SENT>
