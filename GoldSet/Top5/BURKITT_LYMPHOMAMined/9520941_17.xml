<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>High-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the stomach shares several features with its low-grade counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter is nearly invariably associated with Helicobacter pylori, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> normally express surface antigen receptors; thus, it is possible that the high-grade type, like the low-grade type, is still influenced by interaction with antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (V)-region genes from eight cases of high-grade MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and one case of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The V-region genes revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, leading to the conclusion that high-grade MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> derive from antigen-experienced (post-) germinal center B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonrandom distribution of replacement and silent mutations within the gene segments in seven of the eight MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> indicated that these V-region genes were selected by antigen, at least for some period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of the cases showed an unusual mutation pattern that was suggestive of selection by autoantigen or superantigen rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis for intraclonal variations revealed evidence of ongoing mutations in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these cases, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> clones probably derived from cells affected by a germinal center B-cell reaction, as the microenvironment of the germinal center is required for maintenance of an active hypermutation mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in another two cases, no evidence of intraclonal variations was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, either these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> clones were derived from postgerminal center B-cells, or the hypermutation mechanism in the germinal center ceased after some period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the mutation pattern, it is possible that high-grade MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> emerge from further transformation of low-grade MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with accumulation of additional mutations in the complementarity-determining regions </plain></SENT>
