" PROCEDURE: A total of 122 patients (64 boys; median age 5.3 years) with B-lineage ALL without <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> diagnosed between February 1987 and December 1997 were enrolled in the intermediate risk (IR) protocols: Associazione Italiana di Ematologia ed Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP)-ALL 87 (n = 33), 91 (n = 51), and 95 (n = 38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Presymptomatic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> therapy consisted of intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (six doses) and cranial irradiation (18 Gy) in the IR AIEOP 87 study, and extended triple intrathecal therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> depending on age in the IR AIEOP-ALL 91 and 95 protocols (20 and 17 total doses, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>World Health Organization (WHO) grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurotoxicity criteria were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with neurologic symptoms, in addition to physical examination, underwent EEG, computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lumbar puncture to exclude <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> NT was not reported in AIEOP-ALL 87 treated patients, but we observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NT in 3 out of 51 (5.8%) AIEOP-ALL 91 patients, and in 7 out of 38 (18.4%) AIEOP-ALL 95 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NT in our patients with ALL treated with current intermediate risk protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intensification of treatment, however, bettered event free survival (EFS) to 58%, 72% and 85% in IR AIEOP 87, 91 and 95 studies, respectively </plain></SENT>
