<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we have confirmed that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitors</z:chebi> piriprost, nordihydroguiaretic acid and BW755C decreased DNA synthesis and proliferation of leukemic cell lines </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied the actions of two novel, potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitors</z:chebi>, BWA4C and MK886, on proliferation (as measured by estimating the number of viable, trypan blue-excluding cells) and DNA synthesis (measured by the incorporation of radiolabeled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi>) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines HL60, K562 and Jurkat </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data show that endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotriene</z:chebi> generation does not play a significant role in the regulation of proliferation of these leukemic cell lines and suggest that conclusions about <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotriene</z:chebi> involvement in the control of cellular metabolic pathways based on the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitors</z:chebi> should be re-assessed </plain></SENT>
