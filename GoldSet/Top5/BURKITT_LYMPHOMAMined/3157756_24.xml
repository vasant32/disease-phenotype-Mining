<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HeFi-1 selectively stained only the Reed-Sternberg or Hodgkin's cells in 18 of 18 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, including the nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, mixed cellularity, and lymphocyte-depleted histologic subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HeFi-1 did not stain any cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lung, brain, salivary gland, thyroid, gall bladder, pancreas, liver, testis, breast, endometrium, or kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rare large cells at the edge of the lymphoid follicles were stained in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tonsil, colon, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000708'>hyperplastic thymus</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no staining of any cells in 14 cases of B cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; however, the malignant cells in three of 11 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> which appeared to express T cell markers were also stained with HeFi-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue culture cell lines including the T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> lines MOLT4 and CEM, the histiocytic cell line U-937, and the amniotic cell line WISH were not stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines were stained with HeFi-1, but there was no staining of three EBV+ African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines or three EBV- American Burkitt's cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HeFi-1 did not block the ability of the L428 cells to stimulate a mixed lymphocyte reaction or function as accessory cells for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-induced human T cell proliferative responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Modulation of the HeFi-1 cell surface antigen on the L428 cells was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HeFi-1 specifically immunoprecipitated a cell surface protein of approximately 120,000 daltons from both the L428 and EBV+ lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HeFi-1 monoclonal antibody should prove useful not only in the diagnosis, staging, and potential therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, but also for determining the cell of origin of the Reed-Sternberg cell </plain></SENT>
