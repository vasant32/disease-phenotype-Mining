<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Importance of the field: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous human herpesvirus that is causally associated with endemic forms of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> in immunosuppressed individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On a global scale, EBV infects &gt; 90% of the adult population and is responsible for âˆ¼ 1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, there is no efficacious drug or therapy for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and EBV-related diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Areas covered in this review: In this review, we discuss the existing anti-EBV inhibitors and those under development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We discuss the value of different molecular targets, including EBV lytic DNA replication enzymes as well as proteins that are expressed exclusively during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e>, such as EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) and latent membrane protein 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the atomic structure of the EBNA-1 DNA binding domain has been described, it is an attractive target for in silico methods of drug design and small molecule screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We discuss the use of computational methods that can greatly facilitate the development of novel inhibitors and how in silico screening methods can be applied to target proteins with known structures, such as EBNA-1, to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>What the reader will gain: The reader is familiarized with the problems in targeting of EBV for inhibition by small molecules and how computational methods can greatly facilitate this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Take home message: Despite the impressive efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> analogs for the treatment of herpesvirus lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, there remain few effective treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> persists within and contributes to the formation of EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, targeting EBV latent proteins is an unmet medical need </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High-throughput in silico screening can accelerate the process of drug discovery for novel and selective agents that inhibit EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> and associated disease </plain></SENT>
