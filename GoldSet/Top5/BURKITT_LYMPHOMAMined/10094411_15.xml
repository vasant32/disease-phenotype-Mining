<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are indications from genetic, biochemical and cell biological studies that protein kinase CK2 (formerly casein kinase II) has a variety of functions at different stages in the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further characterize CK2 and its potential roles during cell cycle progression, one of the objectives of this study was to systematically examine the expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three subunits of CK2 at different stages in the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To achieve this objective, we examined levels of CK2alpha, CK2alpha' and CK2beta on immunoblots as well as CK2 activity in samples prepared from: (i) elutriated populations of MANCA (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) cells, (ii) serum-stimulated GL30-92/R (primary human fibroblasts) cells and (iii) drug-arrested chicken bursal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> BK3A cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On immunoblots, we observed a significant and co-ordinate increase in the expression of CK2alpha and CK2alpha' following serum stimulation of quiescent human fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By comparison, no major fluctuations in CK2 activity were detected during any other stages during the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we did not observe any dramatic differences between the relative levels of CK2alpha to CK2alpha' during different stages in the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, we observed a significant increase in the amount of CK2beta relative to CK2alpha in cells arrested with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34892">nocodazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also examined the activity of CK2 in extracts or in immunoprecipitates prepared from drug-arrested cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest is the observation that the activity of CK2 is not changed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34892">nocodazole</z:chebi>-arrested cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since CK2 is maximally phosphorylated in these cells, this result suggests that the phosphorylation of CK2 by p34cdc2 does not affect the catalytic activity of CK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the activity of CK2 was increased by incubation with p34cdc2 in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since this activation was independent of ATP we speculate that p34cdc2 may have an associated factor that stimulates CK2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the observations that relative levels of CK2beta increase in mitotic cells, that CK2alpha and CK2beta are phosphorylated in mitotic cells and that p34cdc2 affects CK2 activity in vitro suggest that CK2 does have regulatory functions associated with cell division </plain></SENT>
