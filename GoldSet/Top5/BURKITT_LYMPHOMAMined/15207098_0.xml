<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To construct the expression vector containing transmembrane domain gene of human CD20 and g3pN1 gene and express the fusion gene high-efficiently in E.coli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The human CD20 gene and g3pN1 domain gene were amplified by RT-PCR and PCR from Daudi cells and M13K07 phage antibody library, respectively, and then cloned into expression vector pTIG-Trx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The constructed expression vector was expressed in E.coli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Western blot analysis showed that expressed product could bind to anti-CD20 mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The pTIG-GS has been constructed and expressed successfully in E.coli, which lays the foundation for further screening anti-CD20 antibody from phage antibody library </plain></SENT>
