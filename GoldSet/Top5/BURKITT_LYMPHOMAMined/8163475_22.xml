<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The B cell surface receptor CD22 binds several sialoglycoproteins containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> in alpha 2,6 linkage, on the surface of B and T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because lymphocytes adhere tightly to fibroblasts transfected with CD22 cDNA, it would appear reasonable to suggest that regulatory mechanisms might have evolved which prevent undesired CD22-mediated leukocyte aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we provide evidence for the existence of at least one mechanism that might regulate CD22 interaction with ligands on adjacent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that sialylation of CD22 by beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24163">galactoside</z:chebi> alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase abrogates CD22-mediated lymphocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> can be restored by removal of alpha 2,6-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> residues from the CD22 molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase can both promote and inhibit CD22-ligand interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations provide the first direct evidence that receptor-ligand interactions mediated by an Ig superfamily molecule are under the control of a specific glycosyltransferase </plain></SENT>
