<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A very sensitive <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> binding assay allowing simultaneous evaluation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of a given cell and the quantity of a surface molecule has been developed for these studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fetal erythroid cell line K562, the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell line DAUDI, and their hybrid DUTKO1 have been employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>K562 and the hybrid, but not DAUDI, expressed HLA-A,B,C heavy chains as detected by the monoclonal antibody W6/32.HL, while two monoclonal antibodies (TU48 and 2BC4) against the supertypic specificities HLA-Bw4 and Bw6 showed no reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of human Ia-like antigens on the cell surfaces was investigated with a panel of eight monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>K562 cells were completely unreactive, and DAUDI cells gave the expected positive reaction, but about 1% or less of the cells in the DUTKO1 population appeared to express these antigens as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We discuss possible reasons for the failure to detect HLA-B antigens with monoclonal antibodies and the lack of complete "dominance" of the K562 genome in the hybrid cell line </plain></SENT>
