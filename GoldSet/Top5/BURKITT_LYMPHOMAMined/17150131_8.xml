<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For example, Epstein-Barr Virus is considered a cause of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and other immunosuppression related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153392" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">nasopharyngeal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several other human herpesviruses have been linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> but the totality of evidence is inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a systematic sub-study from within an ongoing case control study of adult black South Africans to investigate the relationship between antibodies to six human herpesviruses and seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> groups that may be caused by infectious agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects had incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> of the oral cavity (n = 88), the cervix (n = 53), the prostate (n = 66), Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 83), non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 80), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (n = 94) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (n = 203) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For comparison, patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (n = 95) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (n = 101) were randomly selected from within the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were interviewed and their blood was tested for IgG antibodies against HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, EBV-EBNA, CMV and HHV-6 using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because these viruses are highly prevalent in this population, optical density results from the assays were used as an indirect, quantitative measure of antibody level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was significant variation in the mean log antibody measures for HSV-2, VZV, CMV and HHV-6 between the disease groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, none of the specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> groups had significantly higher mean log antibody measures for any of the viruses compared to either control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a more detailed examination of seven associations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and herpesviruses for which there had been prior reports, two statistically significant associations were found: a decreasing risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> and an increasing risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153381" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oral cancer</z:e> with increasing tertiles of antibodies against HHV-6 compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients (p-trend = 0.03 and 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios for the top tertile compared to the bottom tertile were 0.58 (95%CI 0.3-1.0) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> and 2.21 (95% CI 1.1-4.3) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153381" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oral cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this population, using these tests for IgG, neither mean antibody measure nor high antibody measure against human herpesviruses 1-6 was strongly associated with any of the seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, we may not have had sufficient power to detect weak associations or associations with a sub-type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> if they were present </plain></SENT>
