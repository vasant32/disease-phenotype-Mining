<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By screening a variety of parameters, including media, sera, effusion fluids, feeder layers, and chemical supplements, the nutritive growth requirements of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells obtained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0080032" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malignant effusions</z:e> and lymph node biopsies were determined for each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of these cell lines initially required human skin fibroblast or epithelial cell feeder layers from which they could be weaned after one to six weeks in culture and maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute Tissue Culture Medium 1640 containing 20% fetal calf serum and 10% pooled human serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several of these cell lines were successfully cloned on 0.5% Noble agar substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the presence of human serum and selected feeder monolayers, cloning efficiencies increased significantly from less than 1% to 15 to 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the cloning efficiencies of certain cell lines showed a concentration-dependent increase with specific chemical supplements including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17561,29950">L-cysteine</z:chebi> and dithiothreitol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Placental colony-stimulating factor, nerve growth factor, epithelial growth factor, and fibroblastic growth factor were ineffective in augmenting the cloning efficiencies of the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a single passage on agar, cells subpassaged from visible colonies showed markedly increased cloning efficiencies to levels as high as 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such cloning efficiencies, coupled with the use of replica plating, make this technique applicable to genetic and quantitative radiobiological, immunological, and chemotherapeutic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although these methods have thus far been used only with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0475799" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoreticular tumors</z:e>, they may also be applicable to the cell culture of other human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
