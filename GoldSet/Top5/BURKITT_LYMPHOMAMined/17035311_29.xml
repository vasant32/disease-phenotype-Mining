<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with a number of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, and latent EBV gene expression has been reported to interfere with cell cycle checkpoints and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that latent EBV can compromise the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint and rescue Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>)-derived cells from caspase-dependent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> initiated in aberrant mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This leads to unscheduled mitotic progression, resulting in <z:mp ids='MP_0004025'>polyploidy</z:mp> and multi- and/or micronucleation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EBV latent genes responsible for this phenotype are expressed from the P3HR1 strain of virus and several viruses with similar genomic deletions that remove the EBNA2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although EBNA2 and the latent membrane proteins are not expressed, the EBNA3 proteins are present in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival of the EBV-positive cells is not consistently associated with EBV lytic gene expression or with the genes that are expressed in EBV latency I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells (i.e., EBNA1, EBERs, and BARTs) but correlates with reduced expression of the cellular proapoptotic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30153">BH3</z:chebi>-only protein <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that a subset of latent EBV gene products may increase the likelihood of damaged DNA being inherited because of the impaired checkpoint and enhanced survival capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This could lead to greater genetic diversity in progeny cells and contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, since it appears that this restricted latent EBV expression interferes with the responses of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cells to cytotoxic drugs, the results of this study may have important therapeutic implications in the treatment of some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
