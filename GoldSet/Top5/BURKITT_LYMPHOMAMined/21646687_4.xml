<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, when co-expressed with a strong oncogene, such as c-Myc, Pim kinases potentiate the oncogenic effect resulting in an acceleration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we show that the least studied Pim kinase, Pim-3, is encoded by a gene directly regulated by c-Myc via binding to one of the conserved E-boxes within the Pim3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> arising in Myc-transgenic mice and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines exhibit elevated levels of Pim-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, inhibition of Pim kinases by a novel pan-Pim kinase inhibitor, Pimi, in Myc-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> results in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> that appears independent of caspases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that Pim kinase inhibition could be a viable treatment strategy in certain human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that rely on Pim-3 kinase expression </plain></SENT>
