<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, the ability of Namalwa (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), U266 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>), and CEM (T-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) cells to interact with the extracellular matrix components vitronectin and fibronectin was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fresh bone marrow plasma cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> also were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Engagement of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, formation and protein composition of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> contacts on the cell surface, phosphorylation of several signal transduction proteins in the contacts, cell proliferation, and enzyme secretion were studied following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to vitronectin and fibronectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three lines adhered to immobilized vitronectin and fibronectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Adhesion</z:e> was fully prevented by neutralizing monoclonal anti-alpha(v)beta(3) integrin antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Integrin engagement caused the formation of phosphorylated pp60(src)/focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> kinase complexes and the aggregation of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> plaques containing the beta(3) integrin subunit, the cytoskeletal proteins vinculin, cortactin, and paxillin, the tyrosine kinases focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> kinase and pp60(src), the adapter protein Grb-2, and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase ERK-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Free and immobilized vitronectin and fibronectin stimulated the proliferation of cells under serum-free conditions and the production and release of urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and increased the release of the activated forms of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in an alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained in <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The demonstrated ability of <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumor</z:mp> cells to interact with the extracellular matrix components vitronectin and fibronectin via alpha(v)beta(3) integrin can be interpreted as evidence of a novel mechanism for their invasion and spreading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This interaction allows them to adhere to the substratum and enhances their proliferation and protease secretion </plain></SENT>
