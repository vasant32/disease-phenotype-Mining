<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven successive leukaphereses were performed to yield a total of 55.2 X 10(9) mononuclear cells (MNC) comprising 15.1 X 10(6) CFU-GM or 4.34 X 10(6) CFU-GEMM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following autologous blood stem cell transplantation (ABSCT), reconstitution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines occurred very rapidly, ie, 1,000 leucocytes per microL were reached after nine days, 500 granulocytes and 50,000 platelets per microL after ten days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B cells reached <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values around day 35 post-transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CFU-GM first appeared in the circulating blood exhibiting an enormous overshoot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some days later CFU-GM also appeared in the marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The kinetics and pattern of hemopoietic reconstitution after myeloablative treatment and ABSCT provide clear evidence that blood-derived hemopoietic stem cells are capable of completely restoring hemopoietic function in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A possible reconstitutive advantage of blood over marrow-derived stem cells is discussed </plain></SENT>
