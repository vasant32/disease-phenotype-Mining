<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) resides as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1264606" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent infection</z:e> in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II+ B lymphocytes and is associated with a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EBV lytic-phase protein gp42 serves at least two functions: gp42 acts as the coreceptor for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> entry into B cells and hampers T-cell recognition via HLA class II molecules through steric hindrance of T-cell receptor-class II-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that gp42 associates with class II molecules at their various stages of maturation, including immature alphabetaIi heterotrimers and mature alphabeta-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When analyzing the biosynthesis and maturation of gp42 in cells stably expressing the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein, we found that gp42 occurs in two forms: a full-length type II membrane protein and a truncated soluble form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Soluble gp42 is generated by proteolytic cleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum and is secreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Soluble gp42 is sufficient to inhibit HLA class II-restricted antigen presentation to T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an almost pure population of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in the EBV lytic cycle, both transmembrane and soluble forms of gp42 are detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results imply that soluble gp42 is generated during EBV lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and could contribute to undetected virus production by mediating evasion from T-cell immunity </plain></SENT>
