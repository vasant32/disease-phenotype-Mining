<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seroprevalence was found to be low in these countries in both the healthy and the HIV-infected populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This correlates with the fact that hardly any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo> has been reported in these countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the African countries of Ghana, Uganda and Zambia showed high seroprevalences in both healthy and HIV-infected populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e> virus-8 (HHV-8) may be either a recently introduced virus or one that has extremely low infectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nasopharyngeal and oral <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients from Malaysia, Hong Kong and Sri Lanka who have very high EBV titres show that only 3/82 (3.7%) have antibody to HHV-8, demonstrating that there is little, if any, cross-reactivity between antibodies to these two gamma viruses </plain></SENT>
