<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>B-lymphocyte development progresses through discrete stages characterized by regular DNA rearrangements of the immunoglobulin (Ig) loci that lead to the transcription of Ig genes and expression of B-cell antigen receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These developmental processes can also be distinguished by the expression of specific cell-surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, rearrangement of the Ig, T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, and surface markers are generally considered as useful markers of the B- and T-cell lineage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, concomitant rearrangement of Ig and TCR genes (double genotype) has been reported in the most immature lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (lineage promiscuity), mainly in B-cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e>), but the mechanism is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA rearrangements and specific cell-surface markers are regulated by several specific transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To better characterize the lineage promiscuity, we studied the relationship among the expression of lymphoid-associated transcription factors, phenotype, and immunogenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement of the Ig light chain kappa gene was found in 37% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> samples and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement of TCR gamma gene was shown in 40% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> samples but was not detected in any of the B-CLL samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the tested B cell-associated transcription factors, Pax5 and E47 genes were expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> and B-CLL samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RAG-1 gene was expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> samples but not in the B-CLL samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Oct-2 gene was expressed in 82% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-CLL samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expression of PU.1 gene was shown in 56% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> but not in the B-CLL samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e>, which did not express the PU.1 gene, showed a significantly high frequency of TCR gamma gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was not found with Oct-2 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that absence of PU.1 expression may result in lineage promiscuity, such as the simultaneous rearrangements of Ig and TCR genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
