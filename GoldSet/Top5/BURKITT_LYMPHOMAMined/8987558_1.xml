<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An oxidized cholesterol mixture, in contrast to cholesterol, was a potent cytotoxin to Namalwa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among oxidized cholesterols examined, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42977">25-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> was the most cytotoxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no oxidized cholesterol examined suppressed IgM production, although cholestanetriol and 7-ketocholesterol did suppress it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, oxidized cholesterols are cytotoxic to lymphocytes, while the influence on the immunoglobulin production may be marginal </plain></SENT>
