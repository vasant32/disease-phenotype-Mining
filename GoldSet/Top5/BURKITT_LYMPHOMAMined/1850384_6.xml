<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Directly growing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-carrying cell lines were established from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) patient (PG) on repeated occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lines carried the same ring chromosome 15 as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells in vivo and were similarly trisomic for chromosome 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed the same JH rearrangement, indicating that they had arisen from the same B-cell progenitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They also had the same single EBV-terminal repeat (TR), indicating that they had been generated by a single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It may be surmised that a single CLL cell had been infected by EBV in vivo and established itself subsequently as a subclone within the CLL population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This subpopulation persists in vivo but does not appear to expand with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After explantation, it transforms into lymphoblastoid cells and proliferates selectively as immortalized lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-representative CLL lines were phenotypically indistinguishable from the B95-8 virus-transformed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diploid cells of the patient, established in parallel by in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They grew as typical LCL clusters and expressed the same B-cell activation markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The methylation status of EBV-DNA was different in the CLL lines and the B95-8-virus-transformed LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When Hpall- and Mspl- digested DNA was probed with BamHI C, E, H and W fragments, the CLL lines showed a mixture of methylated and unmethylated restriction fragments as in certain EBV-carrying Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the EBV-DNA of B95-8 virus-transformed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diploid cells was completely unmethylated, as in other LCLs </plain></SENT>
