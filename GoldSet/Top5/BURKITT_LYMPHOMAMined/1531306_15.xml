<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal antibody (MoAb) cocktail of BA-1, BA-2, and BA-3 plus rabbit complement (C') plus 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) was used to eliminate residual occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells from autografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were conditioned with single-dose total body irradiation (TBI) followed by high-dose Ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 14 patients engrafted at a median of 24 days (range, 12 to 36 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients are alive and disease free at 3.5 years, 3.9 years, and 4.1 years post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meiser estimate and standard error of the probability of sustained remission was 23% +/- 12% at 3.5 years post-BMT with a mean relapse-free interval of 1.4 +/- 0.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The disease-free survival (DFS) at 3.5 years was 21% +/- 11%, with a mean DFS time of 1.3 +/- 0.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A novel and quantitative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) detection assay, which combines fluorescence-activated multiparameter flow cytometry and cell sorting with leukemic progenitor cell (LPC) colony assays, was used to analyze remission BM samples from B-lineage ALL patients for residual LPC, and to evaluate the efficacy of ex vivo BM purging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Notably, the minimal residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> burden before BMT, as measured by the percentage of B-lineage LPC in the pre-BMT remission BM samples, indicated the outcome of the BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median value for the minimal residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> burden before BMT was 0.0035% (35 LPC/10(6) mononuclear cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier estimates and standard errors of the probability of remaining in remission after BMT were 43% +/- 19% for patients whose BM samples contained less than or equal to 0.0035% LPC and 0% +/- 0% for patients whose BM samples contained greater than 0.0035% B-lineage LPC (P less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the minimal residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> burden measured by the described <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> assay system, the percentage of blasts or TdT+ cells in the remission BM samples did not correlate with the probability of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The applied purging protocol showed variable success in destroying target B-lineage LPC populations contaminating the autografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>While in some cases purging was highly effective, eliminating up to greater than or equal to 4 logs of residual B-lineage LPC, in other cases only 0.1 to 0.2 logs of B-lineage LPC were purged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
