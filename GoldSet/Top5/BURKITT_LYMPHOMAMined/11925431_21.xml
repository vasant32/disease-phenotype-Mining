<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we compare mechanisms of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced in human B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells by the inflammatory oxidants <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the mode of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced depends on the nature of the oxidant involved and the medium in which the cells are treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells are exposed to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi>, generated as a flux from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> oxidase, the cells die by a non-apoptotic mechanism (pyknosis/<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>) identical to that seen when cells are treated with a bolus of reagent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Addition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase has no effect, whereas catalase is completely protective, indicating that exogenously generated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> kills cells entirely through its dismutation into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cells treated in culture media with reagent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi> die largely by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is mediated by aminoacyl chloramines generated in the culture media and can be mimicked by treatment of cells with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> chloramine or with long lived chloramines generated from modified Lys or Arg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that in a physiological milieu in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> are the main oxidants being formed, the principal form of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> may be necrotic, and under inflammatory conditions in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi> is generated, apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> may predominate </plain></SENT>
