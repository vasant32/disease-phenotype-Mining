<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increase in the number of EA-positive cells was proportional to interferon concentration up to 10(4) international units (IU)/ml </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 x 10(8) IU/mg protein) IFN-alpha both gave a similar increase in EA expression, strongly suggesting that the effects observed were indeed due to interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, treatment of relatively interferon-insensitive Raji cells with IFN-alpha (1 to 10(4) IU/ml) had no significant effect on either spontaneous or 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine (IdUrd)-induced expression of EA or VCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human IFN-beta also enhanced the expression of EBV EA in Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when the latent EBV present in Daudi cells was activated to enter into a replicative cycle, either by induction with IdUrd or by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> with the non-transforming P3HR1 strain of EBV, then treatment with human IFN-alpha caused a marked inhibition of EA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that interferon can exert a differential action on virus replication depending upon the state of the virus genome within the cell </plain></SENT>
