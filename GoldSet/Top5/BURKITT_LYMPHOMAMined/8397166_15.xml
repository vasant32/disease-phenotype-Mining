<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the nature of this feeder dependence, we characterized the growth requirements of a panel of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-negative and -positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines in both the absence and the presence of feeder cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines and 4 EBV-positive lines displaying the phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells in vivo required high cell density for proliferation in the absence of feeder cells, but grew out as single-cell clones when seeded on irradiated human fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines which had acquired an activated phenotype similar to that of lymphoblastoid cell lines required much lower cell densities for autonomous proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The EBV-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line BL70 was used as a model to study the feeder-cell dependence in more detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BL70 cells grew in the absence of feeder cells only at high cell density and at high FCS concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the presence of feeder cells, BL70 cells became clonogenic even at greatly reduced FCS concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A decrease in either cell density or FCS concentration induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Supernatants from feeder cells and from BL70 cells growing autonomously at high cell density were unable to substitute for the survival and growth-promoting effect of the feeder cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Protection of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by co-cultivation with irradiated fibroblasts was not mediated by induction of bcl-2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
