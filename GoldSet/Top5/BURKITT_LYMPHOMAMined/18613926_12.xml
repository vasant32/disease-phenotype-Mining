<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and one well-characterized paraffin-embedded small round cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, stored in the pathology archive of the Gaslini Institute, were immunohistochemically analysed with the 5B14 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the surface molecule B7-H3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and the blastematous component of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumours</z:e> were completely negative and a few Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimens showed focal positivity, whereas 74% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastomas</z:hpo>, 67% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcomas</z:hpo> and 100% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastomas</z:hpo> were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pattern of immunoreactivity of 5B14 mAb observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo> specimens was limited to the cytoplasmic membrane, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastomas</z:hpo> areas of rosette formation or of ganglion differentiation were preferentially stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> patients high expression of the antigen recognized by the 5B14 mAb was associated with a worse event-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The 5B14 mAb represents an additional tool for the differential diagnosis of small round cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and might be useful in identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> patients at risk of relapse who may take advantage of more careful follow-up </plain></SENT>
