<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the potential of synthetic ribozymes to inhibit bcl-2 expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> defective bcl-2 overexpressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A chemically stabilized hammerhead ribozyme has been targeted to the A+U-rich regulative element of bcl-2 mRNA that is involved in bcl-2 gene switch-off during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The design of the ribozyme was based on the results of probing accessibility of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> target in cellular extracts with antisense DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ribozyme was lipotransfected to a bcl-2 overexpressing human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Raji) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cellular uptake of this ribozyme resulted in a marked reduction of both bcl-2 mRNA and BCL-2 protein levels and dramatically increased cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest a potential therapeutic application of such ribozyme for the treatment of bcl-2 overexpressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
