<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the results in adolescent and adult patients with the use of three successive regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients aged 15-70 years admitted to the Norwegian <z:chebi fb="16" ids="33325">Radium</z:chebi> Hospital in the period 1982-2001 with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e> on histological review and who were given chemotherapy with curative intent are included in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Up to 1987 patients were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy supplemented with intravenous and intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MmCHOP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From 1987 to 1994, patients who obtained complete remission upon this regimen were consolidated with high-dose therapy with stem-cell support (MmCHOP + HDT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 1995 we introduced as frontline therapy the German Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By intention to treat analyses, the progression-free survival rates for patients who received MmCHOP (n=13), MmCHOP + HDT (n=17) or BFM therapy (n=19) are 30.8%, 70.6% and 73.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the groups of patients who received either the BFM regimen or MmCHOP + HDT, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who obtained complete remission upon induction therapy are continuously disease free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using the BFM regimen, continuous remissions are obtained without additional myeloablative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
