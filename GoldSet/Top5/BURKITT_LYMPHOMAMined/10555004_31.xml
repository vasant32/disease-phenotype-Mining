<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Few large series compare <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the nasal cavity with those of the paranasal sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the cases of 58 patients, 34 males and 24 females, aged 7 to 92 years (mean, 57 years), who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involving the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients had diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three were male and 10 were female, with an age range of 7 to 91 years (mean, 63 years); two were HIV-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 2 of 11 cases tested (one in an HIV-positive patient and one of lymphomatoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> type) were Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty (91%) involved paranasal sinuses, 10 with nasal involvement, whereas three cases had nasal, but not sinus, involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, 16 (67%) were free of disease 7 to 169 months later (mean, 65 months), and 8 (33%) had died of disease 2 to 166 months later (mean, 45 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients had nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 10 women and 7 men, aged 27 to 78 years (mean, 48 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 14 were EBV-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had nasal involvement, eight with sinus involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eleven (73%) of 15 were alive and well 6 to 321 months later (mean, 139 months), three (20%) died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 1, 11, and 12 months later, and one (7%) is alive with disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was one case each of marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of unspecified type, and adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0005517'>T-cell lymphoma/leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In an additional three cases, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were composed predominantly of large cells, but no immunophenotyping could be performed for subclassification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 19 cases (17 DLBCLs, 1 Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of uncertain lineage), presenting symptoms included complaints related to the eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In 16 cases (13 DLBCLs, 1 Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1 nasal NK/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of uncertain lineage), the orbit was invaded by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In our series, the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to arise in the sinonasal area is <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, followed by nasal NK/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Comparison of these two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> involving sinuses without nasal involvement were predominantly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> (20 of 21), whereas nasal cavity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> without sinus involvement were usually NK/T-cell type (8 of 11) (p = 0.000125) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, patients with nasal NK/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were overall younger, with a lower male-to-female ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphomas</z:hpo> of B-cell lineage were more likely to be associated with symptoms related to the eyes (p &lt; 0.0005) and to have extension to the orbit (p &lt; 0.01) than were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of T- or NK-cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In contrast to results of Asian studies in which nasal NK/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has a very poor prognosis, our nasal NK/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had an outcome similar to that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
