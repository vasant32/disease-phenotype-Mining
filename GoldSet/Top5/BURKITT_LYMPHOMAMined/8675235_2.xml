<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using DNA electrophoresis and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI)-DNA staining flow cytometry, we demonstrated that apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of target U937 cells and Raji cells was induced in lectin (PWM)-dependent monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity (LDMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LDMC-mediated DNA fragmentation in U937 cells and Raji cells was induced in lectin (PWM)-dependent monocyte mediated cytotoxicity(LDMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The LDMC-mediated DNA fragmentation in U937 cells was completely inhibited by anti-TNF alpha monoclonal antibody (mAb), but not by the addition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35381">monosaccharide</z:chebi> (N-acetylglucosamine, GlcNAc, a sugar specifically recognized by PWM and a lectin-like receptor on monocytes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, GlcNAc inhibited the DNA fragmentation in Raji cells induced by LDMC which the anti-TNF alpha mAb had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PWM was found to stimulate the production of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) from monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The NO-production was enhanced in the presence of target Raji cells, while the enhancement was abolished by the treatment with GlcNAc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By flow cytometry, we found that PWM bound to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells as well as monocytes, and inhibited the expression of HLA-DR antigen on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the presence of lectin molecules on the surface of monocytes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells may bring the two cells together, thus facilitating the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in target cells by triggering the production of cytolytic factors (TNF and NO) and the modification of target cell surface antigen (HLA-DR) </plain></SENT>
