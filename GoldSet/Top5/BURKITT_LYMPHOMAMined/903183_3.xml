<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (36%) manifested delayed hypersensitivity responses to the standard antigens and seven (16%) to the Raji membrane extract at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following successful chemotherapy, there was prompt and significant improvement of reactivity to both the standard and Raji antigens (p greater than 0.001), suggesting that the initial impairment of delayed hypersensitivity was most likely related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By 9 months after treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in sustained remission expressed reactivity to Raji and 21 of 22 to the standard antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the patients skin-tested with the F265 extract at presentation gave a positive response and only one subsequently expressed reactivity after remission was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On relapse, reactivity to the standard antigens was more readily lost (4 of 11) then reactivity to the Raji extract (1 of 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment delayed hypersensitivity to the standard antigens also correlated better with long-term survival than to pretreatment responses to Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It remains to be determined whether the antigens expressed in the Raji extract are indeed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific or related to Epstein-Barr virus </plain></SENT>
