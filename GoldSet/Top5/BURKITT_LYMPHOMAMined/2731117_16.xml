<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous attempts to discern an important clinical difference between the subtypes have failed to provide a convincing reason to maintain this distinction for other than descriptive purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of conflicting reports in the literature, the authors have analyzed 183 cases of SNC NHL in children from the Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group and 129 from St </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results from both series, which consist of approximately the same proportions of B and NB subtypes, (i.e., approximately 54%-58% B, 36% NB, and 6%-10% not otherwise specified) show no significant differences in age at presentation, extent of disease, primary site of involvement, or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that the morphologic distinction between B and NB types of SNC NHL in children lacks demonstrable clinical importance </plain></SENT>
