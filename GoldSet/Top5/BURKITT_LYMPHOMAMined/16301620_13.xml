<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This early process leads to local recruitment of CS-effector T cells after secondary Ag challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These Abs are produced by the B-1 subset of B cells within 1 day after primary skin immunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we report the surprising observation that B-1 cells in the peritoneal cavity are activated as early as 1 h after naive mice are painted with a contact-sensitizing Ag on the skin of the trunk and feet to begin the initiation of CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B-1 cells in the spleen and draining lymph nodes produce the initiating Abs by 1 day after immunization, when we found increased numbers of Ag-specific IgM Ab-producing cells in these tissues by ELISPOT assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we show that contact-activated peritoneal B-1 cells migrate to these lymphoid tissues and then differentiate into Ag-specific IgM Ab-producing cells, resulting in specific CS-initiating IgM Abs in the serum by 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pertussis</z:e> toxin, which is known to inhibit signaling via G protein-coupled chemokines, inhibited the migration of contact-activated peritoneal B-1 cells to the lymphoid tissues, probably due to BLR-1 (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> receptor-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that within 1 h after contact skin immunization, B-1 cells in the peritoneal cavity are activated to migrate to the lymphoid tissues by chemokine-dependent mechanisms to produce serum Ag-specific IgM Abs within 1 day after immunization, leading to local recruitment of CS-effector T cells </plain></SENT>
