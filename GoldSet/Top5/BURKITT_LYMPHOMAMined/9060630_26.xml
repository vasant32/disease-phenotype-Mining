<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> have also been detected at low levels in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequence analyses of clones from a cDNA library derived from the C15 NPC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> indicated that the primary transcripts are differentially spliced, giving rise to a family of related transcripts, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which encompass the BARF0 open reading frame (ORF) at the 3' end of the transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One cDNA was identified that extended the BARF0 ORF at the 5' end, forming the RK-BARF0 ORF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, a rabbit antiserum to a synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> representing an amino acid sequence encoded by the BARF0 ORF was prepared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This antiserum detected a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase-BARF0 fusion protein and both BARF0 and RK-BARF0 proteins expressed from transfected constructs in H1299 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The serum also immunoprecipitated the 20-kDa BARF0 and 30-kDa RK-BARF0 in vitro-translated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analyses identified a protein doublet of 30 and 35 kDa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the EBV-infected cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cellular fractionation studies revealed that the proteins were membrane associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sizes of the proteins detected in cell lines and their association with membranes suggests that they are likely encoded by the RK-BARF0 transcript, which is predicted to contain a membrane localization signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The proteins were also detected in protein extracts prepared from NPC biopsies and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> biopsy but not from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206186" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hairy leukoplakia</z:e>, a permissive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results reveal that the rightward <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcripts from the BamHI A region of EBV encode one or more proteins that are expressed in latently infected cells and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
