<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 31 ABLL patients (23 males, 8 females, mean age 27 years) participated in the study performed in Hematological Research Center in 1995-2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ABLL stage I, II, III and IV was diagnosed in 3, 5, 8 and 15 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>10 patients had diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>9 patients received 2 to 6 courses of CHOP, 1 patient--6 courses of Pro-Mace-Cytabom, 11 patients with newly diagnosed ABLL and 5 pretreated with CHOP--NHL-BFM-90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The modified protocol ABLL-M-04 of intensive short-term therapy included 10 patients, 2 of them pretreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 10 patients given CHOP or CHOP-like courses 9 were resistant to therapy, 2 died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo>, 7 were converted to the program therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>5 patients on the protocol NHL-BFM-90 died after short-term improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of them achieved remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 10 patients with newly diagnosed ABLL treated according to NHL-BFM-90 protocol, remission was achieved in 4 patients, follow-up median--34 months (2-56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients died: 4 of progression, 2 of chemotherapy complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e>-M-04 therapy was made in 9 patients: 7 patients persisted on the first remission, 2 patients died of chemotherapy complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall duration of the treatment was 3-3.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The protocol ABLL-M-04 seems to be more effective than a classic NHL-BFM-90, but this must be supported by more cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CHOP therapy cannot be recommended for patients with ABLL because of poor efficacy (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the CHOP patients died) </plain></SENT>
