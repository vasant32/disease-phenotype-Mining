<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> of cells of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative human B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines BJAB and Ramos with EBV preparations from P3HR-1 or B 95-8 cells converted these cells to EBV genome carriers expressing Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) in almost 100% of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Induction of these cells as well as of clones from P3HR-1 EBV-converted BJAB cells with iododeoxyuridine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22526">aminopterin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi> resulted in the appearance of a nuclear antigen in about 1-6% of the cells 1-4 days after induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antigen is different from known EBV-induced antigens like EBNA, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (VCA) or the D- and R-subspecificities of the early antigen (EA) complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence and inactivated after <z:chebi fb="15" ids="15347">acetone</z:chebi> fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antigen was not detectable after induction of uninfected BJAB and Ramos cells nor has it been found in noninduced or induced P3HR-1 and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, it appears that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV-infection</z:e> mediates the expression of this antigen, for which the name TINA (transiently induced nuclear antigen) is suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sera reacting against TINA generally contained high antibody titers against EBV-induced EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only a limited number of highly EA-reactive sera, however, were also positive for TINA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 200 sera tested thus far, TINA reactivity was most frequently observed in sera of patients with nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (7 out of 28), in sera of the only two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079746" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastoma</z:e> tested and occasionally in sera from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among 70 sera from nontumor patients, TINA reactivity was observed three times: two patients suffered from "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e>, the other revealed persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
