<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We have found that EBNA-2 through EBNA-6 and LMP can be up regulated by treating the group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line Rael with the DNA-demethylating agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> (5-AzaC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The drug acted in a time- and dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>EBNA-2-positive cells were detected by anti-complement immunofluorescence staining just 12 h after addition of 4 microM 5-AzaC and reached a maximum number at 72 h, when up to 75% of the population was positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>EBNA-2, EBNA-3, EBNA-4, EBNA-4, EBNA-6, and LMP were demonstrated immunoblots starting at 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The EBV-encoded early antigens and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigens were also induced but at a lower level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>EBNA-2 and the lytic cycle-associated antigens appeared with a different time course and in largely nonoverlapping cell subpopulations, as demonstrated by double fluorescence staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Thus, EBNA-2 expression was not restricted to lytically infected cells, nor was EBNA-2 required for entry into the lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The coding and regulatory sequences of EBNA-2 and LMP were found to be highly methylated in Rael cells and were, as expected, demethylated after 5-AzaC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that DNA methylation may participate in the regulation of growth transformation-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
