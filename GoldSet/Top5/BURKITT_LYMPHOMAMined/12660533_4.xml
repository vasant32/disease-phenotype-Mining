<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to evaluate intrathecal chemoprophylaxis for patients with good immunological parameters and high risk of meningeal relapse (bone marrow, paraspinal or paranasal involvement or Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> histology) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospective data, which has been collected on our cohort of 8640 HIV seropositive patients treated at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital includes 176 patients with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related NHL, was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At presentation, 18 (10%) patients had meningeal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were significant associations between meningeal disease and both Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and paraspinal or paranasal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the overall survival between patients with or without meningeal involvement at presentation (Kaplan-Meier log-rank, P = 0.35) and the 1-year actuarial survivals are 25% [95% confidence interval (CI), 3-47%] for patients with meningeal involvement and 33% (95% CI, 26-41%) for those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy was administered to 21 high-risk patients and four (19%) relapsed with meningeal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This single-centre experience of a large cohort has demonstrated that meningeal involvement at presentation correlates with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> histology and paraspinal or paranasal space disease, but not with bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also documents that long-term survival is achievable rarely in patients who present with meningeal disease and in patients with isolated meningeal relapse </plain></SENT>
