<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human interferon alpha A, produced in Escherichia coli by recombinant DNA technology, was labeled with 125I to study its binding to receptors on human lymphoblastoid Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This binding showed a marked temperature dependency, with maximum binding obtained at 30-37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>About 60% of the cell-bound radioactivity was released upon subsequent addition of unlabeled interferon, indicating that only part of the cell-bound interferon could be displaced by competitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, about 30-50% of cell-bound interferon was not released by treating the cells with 0.2 N <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>, a procedure which removes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25905">polypeptide hormones</z:chebi> on the cell surface, indicating that part of the interferon bound at 37 degrees C was internalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This interferon was slowly degraded to acid-soluble products, which were released into the culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of DAudi cells with the lysosomotropic <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16830">methylamine</z:chebi> inhibited the degradation of interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16830">Methylamine</z:chebi>, however, also inhibited the internalization of interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Daudi cells treated with interferon in the presence of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> showed an increase in the interferon-induced enzyme 2',5'-oligo(A) polymerase comparable to that of cells treated with interferon alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This enzyme increased to a similar extent in cells treated with interferon and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">cytochalasin</z:chebi>, a drug which inhibited internalization of interferon by 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that degradation and possibly internalization of interferon are not required for at least some of its biological activities </plain></SENT>
