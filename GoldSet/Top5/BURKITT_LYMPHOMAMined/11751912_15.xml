<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantitative and structural variations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> residues can profoundly affect specific cell-cell, pathogen-cell, or drug-cell interactions, but manipulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acids</z:chebi> in mammalian cells has been technically limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the finding of a previously unrecognized and efficient uptake and incorporation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> analogues in mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We added 16 synthetic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> analogues carrying distinct C-1, C-5, or C-9 substitutions individually to cell cultures of which 10 were readily taken up and incorporated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Uptake of C-5- and C-9-substituted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acids</z:chebi> resulted in the structural modification of up to 95% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acids</z:chebi> on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functionally, binding of murine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi>-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin-2 (Siglec-2, CD22) to cells increased after N-glycolylneuraminic acid treatment, whereas 9-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17012">N-acetylneuraminic acid</z:chebi> abolished binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>susceptibility to infection</z:hpo> by the B-lymphotropic papovavirus via a sialylated receptor was markedly enhanced following pretreatment of host cells with selected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> analogues including 9-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17012">N-acetylneuraminic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This novel experimental strategy allows for an efficient biosynthetic engineering of surface sialylation in living cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is versatile, extending the repertoire of modification sites at least to C-9 and enables detailed structure-function studies of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi>-dependent ligand-receptor interactions in their native context </plain></SENT>
