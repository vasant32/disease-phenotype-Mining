<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EBV-converted sublines expressed c-myc at a 2- to 6-fold higher level than the original BJAB during exponential growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EBV-positive BJAB lines are known to differ from the parent line in several phenotypic characteristics, including increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> clonability, lower serum requirement and, in one case, increased tumorigenicity in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pattern of increased c-myc expression accompanying EBV conversion was not observed in the myc/Ig translocation-carrying Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line RAMOS or in 2 of its EBV-converted sublines </plain></SENT>
