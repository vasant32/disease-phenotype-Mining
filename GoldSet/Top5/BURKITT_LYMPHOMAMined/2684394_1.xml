<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate a role for globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated antigen, variant cells resistant to treatment with complement and monoclonal antibody 38-13, which recognizes Gb3, were selected from a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Ramos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Variant cells displayed a clear decrease of antibody-binding capacity whereas the amount of Gb3 at their plasma membrane was not significantly different from that of Ramos parental cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This demonstrated a reduced accessibility of Gb3 at the surface of variant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In parallel, no changes in other surface antigens were recorded as compared to those in Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No changes of proliferative properties in suspension culture or of c-myc expression were observed although variant cells showed a decreased colony-forming capacity in agar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variant cells showed a significant reduction in tumorigenic potential when injected s.c. into <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decreased tumorigenicity appeared related to the low antibody-binding capacity because both tumorigenicity and Gb3 antigenicity were recovered in parallel in <z:mp ids='MP_0003171'>revertant</z:mp> cells growing in suspension culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo, after two transplantations of variant cells into mice, cells isolated from the few induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> still retained the low antibody-binding capacity </plain></SENT>
