<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of cyclin D2 is induced in primary B lymphocytes following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or transfection of the EBV genes EBNA-LP and EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, attempts to induce cyclin D2 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines by the enforced expression of EBV genes were unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the demethylation agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> has been shown to modulate <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, we explored the possibility that methylation plays a significant role in the control of cyclin D2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> treatment of the Mutu CI 179 BL cell line led to expression of cyclin D2 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and that expression correlated with differences in the methylation status of a CCGG restriction enzyme site near the transcription initiation region of the cyclin D2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, methylation appears to play a direct role in the regulation of the cyclin D2 locus in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
