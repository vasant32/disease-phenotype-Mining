<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of these can be correlated with particular parameters such as age, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the blasts, lymphocyte surface markers, prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Karyotype is an important independent prognostic factor in ALL, even when other well-known risk factors are considered but an abnormal clone is not always associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have been shown to present characteristic and specific translocations t(8;14) and variants t(2;8) and t(8;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It appears that the structural change of chromosome no 8 involving band q24 is a consistent chromosome feature in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, and that this peculiar region on chromosome no 8 probably plays an important biological role in the development of these malignant proliferations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of cytogenetic and molecular biology techniques would allow in the near future a better understanding of the genesis and significance of chromosome anomalies in malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
