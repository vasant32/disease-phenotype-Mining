<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BNIP3 is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the expression and methylation status of BNIP3 gene to better understand the role of epigenetic alteration of its expression in haematopoietic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylation of the region around the BNIP3 transcription start site was detected in four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and one Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, and was closely associated with silencing the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>That expression of BNIP3 was restored by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (5-aza-dC), a methyltransferase inhibitor, which confirmed the gene to be epigenetically inactivated by methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, re-expression of BNIP3 using 5-aza2-dC also restored <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in methylated cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Acetylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 in the 5' region of the gene, which was assessed using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, correlated directly with gene expression and inversely with DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e>, methylation of BNIP3 was detected in five of 34 (15%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath>, six of 35 (17%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> and three of 14 (21%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myelomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that aberrant DNA methylation of the 5' CpG island and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylation play key roles in silencing BNIP3 expression in haematopoietic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
