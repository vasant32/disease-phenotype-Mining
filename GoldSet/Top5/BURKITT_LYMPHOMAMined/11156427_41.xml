<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas it has been suggested that the main mechanisms of action are complement-mediated and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we demonstrate that monoclonal antibody IDEC-C2B8 is a strong inducer of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in CD20-positive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines reflecting different stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, CD20-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was inducible in human surface IgM-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines as well as in more mature surface IgM-negative B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines carrying the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, we observed a striking correlation between anti-CD20- and B-cell receptor-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> with regard to sensitivity toward the apoptotic stimuli and the execution of the apoptotic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, induction of anti-CD20- or B-cell receptor-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> involved rapid up-regulation of the proapoptotic protein Bax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we show similar changes in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression level of two early response genes, c-myc and Berg36, as well as activation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase family members p44 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1) and p42 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2) and activation of activator protein 1 (AP-1) DNA binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data support our hypothesis that both pathways are mediated in part by the same signal-transducing molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results might help explain the resistance and regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> to IDEC-C2B8 and give new insights in the signaling cascade after CD20 ligation </plain></SENT>
