<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although living donor liver transplant (LDLT) has been increasingly performed, PTLD after LDLT has not been well investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of PTLD after LDLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated 323 consecutive patients undergoing adult-to-adult LDLT and identified three patients who developed biopsy-proven PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them were seropositive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and had <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> at transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334798" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">monomorphic PTLD</z:e>, including one diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and two Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with c-myc rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of them were EBV negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial therapy included chemotherapy, rituximab, and immunosuppression withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> during treatment and two patients achieved complete responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We showed a relatively low incidence and distinct clinicopathological features of PTLD after adult-to-adult LDLT, which might reflect the unique nature of LDLT </plain></SENT>
