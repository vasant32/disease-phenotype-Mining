<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>miR155 and BIC, its host gene, have been reported to accumulate in human B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, especially in diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and certain types of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that E(mu)-mmu-miR155 transgenic mice exhibit initially a preleukemic pre-B cell proliferation evident in spleen and bone marrow, followed by frank B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the role of miR155 is to induce polyclonal expansion, favoring the capture of secondary genetic changes for full transformation </plain></SENT>
