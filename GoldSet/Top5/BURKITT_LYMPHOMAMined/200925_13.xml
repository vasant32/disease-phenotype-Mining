<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To carry out this comparison, cleaved cell DNAs were electrophoresed in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gels and transferred to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53325">nitrocellulose</z:chebi> paper, and the immobilized <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> species were identified by hybridization with purified, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA labeled in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These studies lead to three findings: (i) The complexities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the intracellular <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNAs are similar to one another and to that of purified virion DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(II) There are small differences in the cleavage patterns of some <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNAs, but the differences of the cleavage patterns of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA resident in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and in the cells transformed in vitro are not more pronounced than those found between the different clones of the cells transformed in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(iii) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA species contain a repeated sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first two conclusions indicate that the Epstein-Barr virus strain studied in the laboratory appears indistinguishable from that associated with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
