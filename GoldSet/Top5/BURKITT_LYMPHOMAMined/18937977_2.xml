<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the role of Notch signaling in B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we expressed a soluble fragment of human Delta-like1 (hDll1) in E. coli, which was shown to activate the Notch signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incubation of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji cells with the soluble hDll1 led to gamma-secretase-dependent up-regulation of a Notch downstream gene, Hes1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This treatment synergized with B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated signaling to promote proliferation of Raji cells in vitro, which was cancelled by GSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further showed that Notch signaling significantly repressed, while gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) enhanced, "natural" <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because c-myc is a downstream gene of both Notch signaling and BCR signaling, and GSI blocked c-myc expression in the presence of hDll1 and anti-IgM, Notch signaling might interact with BCR signaling at the level of c-myc expression to regulate proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
