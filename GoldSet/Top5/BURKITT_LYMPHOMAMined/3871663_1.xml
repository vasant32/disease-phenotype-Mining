<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-release assay, the cytotoxic potential of lymphocytes pretreated with P(Bu)2 for a short time was reduced while after prolonged treatment their function was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The peak of lytic potential was attained after 15 hr of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the cytotoxic results obtained in suspension and immobilized conjugate assays suggested that P(Bu)2 treatment causes an impairment of the recycling capacity of lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After prolonged exposure, the lytic machinery became activated as reflected by the reduced time elapsing after contact between effectors and targets and the delivery of lethal hit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The activation was also observed in the immobilized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was reflected by the elevated proportion of damaged targets that were bound to the treated lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The P(Bu)2- and interferon-induced augmentation of lytic potential is achieved through different mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment applied to the effectors in sequence (first P(Bu)2 followed by interferon), resulted in an additive effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, simultaneous treatment with IL-2 and P(Bu)2 also gave an additive increase in cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Addition of antibodies directed against IL-2 did not abrogate the P(Bu)2 effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consequently, neither interferon nor IL-2 are involved in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi>-induced cytotoxic function </plain></SENT>
