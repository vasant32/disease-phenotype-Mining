<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are non-lineage restricted and are supposed to be activation markers except for cases where they represent pathological phenotype like HLA-DR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre B-ALL</z:e>, CD38 in some M0 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">plasmocytoma</z:e> or CD38 and CD71 in less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521897" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mature T-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used flow cytometry, immunofluorescent staining, DNA staining by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> and quantification by calibration particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated increased MESF values of HLA-DR compared with controls in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> investigated disorders, what could have a prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated significantly higher MESF values of HLA-DR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cALL</z:e> (37,300-46,000) in comparison with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (9400-12,400), what could represent another important parameter when distinguishing between these two groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cells of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients with lower CD38% and CD71% increased MESF values (5100 for CD38 and 7900 for CD71), were found while in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cALL</z:e> patients with high percentages of CD71 and CD38 there were lower MESF values what could indicate a possible connection of higher stage of cell maturation with increased density of CD38 and CD71 markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We investigated possible relationship between percentage of expression of HLA-DR, CD38 and CD71 and proliferation rate by DNA analysis of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a group of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, there was no significant increase of proliferation index of malignant cells compared with control </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one patient with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> we demonstrated significant increase of proliferation index of CD71+ subpopulation compared with CD71- one, what indicates that in aggressive form of NHL CD71 can be evaluated not only as activation but also as proliferation marker </plain></SENT>
