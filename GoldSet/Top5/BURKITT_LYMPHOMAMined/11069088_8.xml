<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>For naive B cells to mature in response to antigen triggering and become either plasma cells or memory B cells, a complex array of events takes place within germinal centers (GC) of secondary lymphoid organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the long-term objective of defining and characterizing molecules that control the generation of GC, we have subtracted <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> messages derived from highly purified B cells at the follicular mantle stage of differentiation from GC B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using this approach, we have identified a novel molecule, centerin, belonging to the family of serine-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> or serpins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcription of centerin is highly restricted to GC B cells and their malignant counterparts, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The putative centerin protein shares the highest sequence identity with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi>-binding globulin and possesses arginine/serine at its P1/P1' active site, suggesting that it interacts with a trypsin-like protease(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, several other sequence features of centerin also indicate that it serves as a bonafide <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrate differentially up-regulated transcription of this novel gene by resting, naive B cells stimulated in vitro via CD40 signaling, while Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain-mediated B cell activation fails to generate this reponse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because CD40 signaling is required for naive B cells to enter the GC reaction and for GC B cells to survive, it is likely that centerin plays a role in the development and/or sustaining of GC </plain></SENT>
