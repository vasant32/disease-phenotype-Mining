<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two cell lines, i.e. the asparaginase-dependent (Berkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells) and the asparaginase-independent (the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovary cancer</z:e> cells) were used as the test-system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incorporation of 3H-timidine into DNA was used as the criterion of the drug effect on the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Krasnitin was used as the reference preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preparation of asparaginase-glutaminase was inferior to krasnitine by its specific antitumour asparaginase activity and superior to it by the general cytotoxicity in the cells of CaOv </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the help of the above test-system it is possible to study the specific asparaginase activity of the drugs containing L-asparaginase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For studying the specific glutaminase properties it is necessary to develop another cell test-system </plain></SENT>
