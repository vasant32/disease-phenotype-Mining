<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PBMN were incubated with SF for 48 h, washed to remove SF components, treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> (mit C) and co-cultured with Raji cells, a lymphoblastoid cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Raji cell proliferation was inhibited by SF-treated PBMN proportionally to SF concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SF (50-200 micrograms), mit C-treated Raji cells or mit C-treated PBMN pre-incubated with phytohaemagglutinin were without effect on Raji cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Suppressor T lymphocytes generated by incubation of PBMN with concanavalin A inhibited Raji cells to the same extent as did SF-treated PBMN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> activity was lost following heating at 56 degrees C for 30 min; freezing and thawing reduced the ability of SF to induce suppression by 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dialysis of SF or treatment with antibody to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> led to a 50% reduction in suppression </plain></SENT>
