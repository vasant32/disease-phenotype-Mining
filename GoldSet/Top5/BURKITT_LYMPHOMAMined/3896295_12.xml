<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>50 cases of advanced, intermediate (18) and high grade (32) non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) including 16 with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have been treated with very high dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cases represent a retrospective analysis of the combined experience of a recently established collaborative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>31 patients were treated with a protocol used in Lyon, 12 with that used in Marseille and seven with that used in London </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the details of drug administration differed, each protocol was based on high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> or melphalan), BCNU and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>16 patients had drug resistant progressive NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these 11 responded to high dose treatment (nine CR, two PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The duration of CR in this group was short (median 104d) and only one patient was in CR at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>19 patients had relapsed on previous therapy but were still responding to conventional rescue therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following high dose therapy 47% of these patients are in continuous CR with a median time of observation of 300 d (73-962 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were partial responders to conventional induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these, six had a CR with high dose treatment and are still in CR (range 39-1230 d, median 200 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eight patients received high dose therapy as intensification after a long delay to CR with conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of these, four are alive and in remission 124-763 d after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The high dose protocols produced significant morbidity with 25 patients (50%) having major or minor treatment-related complications, and there were seven treatment related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, these results indicate that durable responses can be obtained with high dose chemotherapy in patients who have been heavily treated and indicate a role for this type of treatment at an earlier stage in advanced non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
