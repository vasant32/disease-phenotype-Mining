<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analyses have shown that a 14q+ chromosome resulting from either a t(8;14)(q24;q32) or a t(11;14)(q13;q32) was the most consistent abnormality but no specific chromosomal aberration has been identified in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells from 121 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> were analyzed cytogenetically by standard banding techniques including RHG, GTG and CBG banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells were cultured for 24-96 h in the presence or in the absence of interleukin-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clonal abnormalities were detected in 41 of the 121 patients (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A der(16)t(1;16)(q10;p10) abnormality was identified in nine of these 41 patients (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Der(16) was identified at diagnosis in five patients, during disease progression in two additional patients, and at the time of a relapse in the two last cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The t(1;15)(q10;p10) translocation was always unbalanced, resulting in a <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 16q in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CBG banding did not demonstrate dicentric chromosomes and the whole chromosome painting confirmed the der(16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A large number of other chromosomal abnormalities were associated with der(16), including chromosomal rearrangements involving the 8q24 band in five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four of these five cases were Burkitt's-type translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that der(16)t(1;16)(q10;p10) could be one of the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities that can be identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
