<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drug-resistant phenotype was accompanied by changes in gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of four unrelated genes was examined by Northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Raji-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> cells were found to contain about twice the number of actin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> found in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both cell lines were found to contain equivalent amounts of beta 2-microglobulin, c-myc oncogene, and immunoglobulin C mu <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The C mu <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was, however, larger in size in Raji-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increased actin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> content was correlated with an increased actin content of Raji-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The F-actin (stained with 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazolylphallacidin) content of single cells was quantitated in a meridian interactive laser cytometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Raji-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> cells contained about twice the amount of F-actin present in the parental Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained when large populations, 10(6) cells each, were examined in a flow cytometer </plain></SENT>
