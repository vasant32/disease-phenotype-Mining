<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to record the distribution of the different subtypes, analyze the major subtypes, and compare it with the published data from other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A review of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220612" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric NHL</z:e> statistics from population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries was included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was conducted using information retrieved from the files of our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 467 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (excluding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e>) were recorded in the under 20 years group over a period of 6 years, of which 252 patients suffered from NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The demographic characteristics, frequency and distribution of different subtypes were noted and compared with published reports from other parts of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: T-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> constituted the majority (32.1%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHLs in children and adolescents in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other major subgroups were Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in this study had clinical presentations similar to those seen in western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of different subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in pediatric and adolescent NHL in India differs considerably from that in western countries and other eastern countries </plain></SENT>
