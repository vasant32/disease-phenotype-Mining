<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of unpurified E. tirucalli latex on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line was treated with varying dilutions of the latex and the effects on EBV gene expression were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed that the latex was capable of reactivating the EBV lytic cycle in a dose-dependent manner and at dilutions as low as 10(-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous treatment of cells with E. tirucalli latex and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37700">protein kinase C inhibitor</z:chebi> 1-(5-isoquinolinesulphonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride blocked lytic cycle activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that environmental exposure to the latex of E. tirucalli could directly activate the EBV lytic cycle and provide further evidence of a role for E. tirucalli in the aetiology of eBL </plain></SENT>
