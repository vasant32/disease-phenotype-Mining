<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A further improvement could be achieved through targeting of liposome-entrapped drug selectively to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the conjugation of the anti-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> monoclonal antibody LL2 to the surface of DXR-loaded liposomes by use of a <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-based heterobifunctional coupling agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Competitive-binding ELISA of the resulting immunoliposomes (SIL) against the monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody, WN, indicated preserved immunological activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pH-sensitive probe, HPTS was used to study the binding of liposomes with target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed a 3.8-fold increased cellular association of SIL compared to that of SL and an apparent internalization of SIL into low pH compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition of an excess of unconjugated free LL2 displaced about 72% of the HPTS-SIL association with cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Experiments with 125I-labeled free and SIL-bound LL2 showed approximately 50% degradation for both preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> cytotoxicity tests against neoplastic B cells gave IC(50) values of 1.6, 2.9 and 0.35 microM for DXR-SIL, DXR-SL and free DXR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Leakage of drug from the liposomes apparently reduced the specificity of the cytotoxic action of DXR-SIL </plain></SENT>
