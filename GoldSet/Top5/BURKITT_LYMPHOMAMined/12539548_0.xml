<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 38 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), the genomic DNA of mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow was amplified by using hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and the expression of cyclin D1 protein of mononuclear cells was detected by using immunohistochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 10 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow served as control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that BCL-1 rearrangement was detectable in 3 of 38 ALL patients (7.9%) and cyclin D1 protein positive expression was detected in 4 ALL patients (10.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three ALL patients with BCL-1 rearrangement were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) and accompanied by cyclin D1 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No BCL-1/IgH rearrangement or cyclin D1 protein expression was detected in 12 patients with granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 10 cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte counts in peripheral blood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> patients with BCL-1 rearrangement and (or) cyclin D1 protein expression were significantly increased and the patients had bad reaction to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that: 1) BCL-1/IgH gene rearrangement were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> B lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>; 2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> patients with BCL-1 rearrangement and (or) cyclin D1 protein expression had poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
