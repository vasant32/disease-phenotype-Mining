<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Telomerase is an enzyme that is required for maintenance of telomeres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This enzyme has been shown to be present in germline tissues and majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The regulation of telomerase is an area of active investigation in different models because, potentially, inhibition of this enzyme could be important in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study the regulation of this enzyme in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, we used DMSO to produce a reversible G0/G1 arrest in Raji cell line, as shown earlier [Sawai M, Takase K, Teraoka H, Tsukada K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reversible G1 arrest in the cell cycle of human lymphoid cell lines by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulphoxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exp Cell Res 1990;187:4-10] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, we use a highly quantifiable conventional (non-amplified) assay to study the effect of DMSO on telomerase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we studied cellular proliferation and cell cycle profiles of the cells treated and, subsequently, released from DMSO induced blockage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this model, DMSO reversibly inhibited telomerase activity that could be restored after release from the blockage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of telomerase seems to parallel cellular proliferation and it appears that telomerase is regulated upon entry into the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This view is consistent with other previously published views on relationship of telomerase with exit from cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our observations demonstrate a novel effect of DMSO on cellular mechanisms in Raji cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It may provide an attractive model to further study regulation of telomerase in this cell line </plain></SENT>
