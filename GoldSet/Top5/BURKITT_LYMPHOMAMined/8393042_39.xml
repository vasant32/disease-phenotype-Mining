<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that a large fraction of human gamma delta PBL recognize Ag of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origins, respectively found in hydrosoluble mycobacterial extracts and on the Daudi Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The structural basis of the recognition of these Ag have been presently studied in detail, through analysis of a large panel of thymus- and peripheral blood-derived gamma delta T-cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that Daudi and mycobacteria-reactive gamma delta subsets are strictly overlapping and hence that gamma delta T-cell responses against these two Ag are closely related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Daudi cells and mycobacteria were recognized by V gamma 9+V delta 2+, but not by V gamma 9+V delta 2-, V gamma 9-V delta 2+, or V gamma 9-V delta 2- PBL clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> V gamma 9+V delta 2+ clones were reactive and, in particular: 1) the proportion of Ag-reactive lymphocytes was much lower among thymus- than PBL-derived clones (respectively 24/36 vs 72/73); 2) none of the V gamma 9+V delta 2+ clones expressing a V9J2C2 gamma chain (n = 4) were reactive to Daudi or mycobacteria, indicating that expression of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-linked TCR is probably a prerequisite for recognition of these Ag; and 3) among V gamma 9+V delta 2+ clones bearing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-linked TCR, almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (50/53) clones expressing a V9JPC1 gamma chain were reactive, whereas a large fraction (6/10) of those expressing a V9J1C1 gamma chain were weakly or nonreactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Together, these observations suggest that germline residues specific to V gamma 9, V delta 2, and J gamma P elements directly contribute to recognition of Daudi and mycobacterial Ag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these findings may provide an explanation for coordinate use of these gene elements by a large fraction of gamma delta PBL, through peripheral selection events mediated by ligands identical or structurally related to the above Ag </plain></SENT>
