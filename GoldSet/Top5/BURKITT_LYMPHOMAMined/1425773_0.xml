<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An improved method allowing incorporation of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> into the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> pool of human lymphoid cells is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The procedure devised involves cell permeabilization with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi>-activated membranolytic toxin, alveolysin, and optimization of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> labeling and extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these conditions 4 to 10% of the added [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> is found intracellularly and half of this amount (2-5%) is incorporated into the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> pool in only 1 h as compared to the classical 0.2 to 0.3% incorporation obtained after 10 to 20 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The integrity of coupling between receptors and phospholipase C was assessed by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24846">inositol phosphate</z:chebi> production after cell stimulation by various <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
