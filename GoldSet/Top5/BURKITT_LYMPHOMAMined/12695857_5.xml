<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To clarify the relationships between the degree of lectin-cell binding, cytotoxicity and cytoagglutinating activity of plant-derived lectins in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes and cultured leukemic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plant lectins with different quaternary structures and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23008">saccharide</z:chebi> specificity were used: Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>), Soybean agglutinin (SBA) and Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The leukemic cell lines used were: Jurkat, MOLT-4, RPMI-8402, HPB-ALL, CCR-HSB-2 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">BALL</z:e>-1 (derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>); Raji and Daudi (derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>); K-562 (derived from myelogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lectin-cell binding was detected microscopically and fluorimetrically using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-conjugated lectins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity was estimated by the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, and cytoagglutinating activity by a spectrophotometric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The binding of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> and SBA to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes was negligible, while their binding to leukemic cells increased markedly with increasing lectin concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analogous results were obtained for WGA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it was found that WGA also interacted to a significant degree with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of lectin-cell binding increased in the order: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>&lt;SBA&lt;WGA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cytoagglutinating activity and cytotoxicity of lectins increased in the same order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> did not exhibit a cytotoxic effect against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or leukemic cells, and showed a poor cytoagglutinating activity only in MOLT-4, CCR-HSB-2 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">BALL</z:e>-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SBA exhibited poor cytotoxicity against Jurkat, RPMI-8402, HPB-ALL and CCR-HSB-2 cells, but a well-defined cytotoxicity against Raji and Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SBA showed poor cytoagglutinating activity in leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, WGA at concentrations higher than 0.05 microM showed high cytotoxicity against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> leukemic cell lines tested as well as against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>WGA also showed a well-expressed cytoagglutinating effect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines except <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was a moderate inverse correlation between cell viability and the velocity of cytoagglutination ( r=-0.56, P&lt;0.001), and a good correlation between cell viability and the degree of lectin-cell binding ( r=-0.75, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There was a low positive correlation between the velocity of cytoagglutination and the degree of lectin-cell binding ( r=0.43, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the lectins that bound most strongly to leukemic cells expressed higher cytotoxic and cytoagglutinating activities </plain></SENT>
