<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four of the eight MAb inhibited growth of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four of these antibodies reacted in antibody-dependent macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity (ADMC) assays in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MAb that were inactive in vivo also did not react in these assays in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of antibody-binding sites per cell on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell surface was significantly higher for tumoricidal MAb as compared to unreactive MAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells binding the MAb and the binding affinity to these cells were the same for the two groups of MAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, tumoricidal and nontumoricidal MAb bound with similar affinity and antibody density to Fc receptors on macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The importance of the number of antibody sites on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell surface for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> destruction by MAb was confirmed by the demonstration of tumoricidal effects of mixtures of MAb that were by themselves not tumoricidal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAb binding to different molecules on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> cells were complementary in ADMC, whereas MAb directed to the same molecule but to different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> were not </plain></SENT>
