<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>S1 mapping data showed that these cells had the expected levels of steady-state rRNA transcribed from mouse ribosomal gene (rDNA) transcription units but undetectable levels of rRNA derived from the human rDNA transcription templates that are also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase I-dependent, cell-free transcription extracts were made from three hybrid lines and were found to be capable of transcribing cloned rDNA templates of mouse but not human origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Partially purified human factors required for rDNA transcription in vitro were added to the M greater than H extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One fraction with almost no <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase I activity conferred on these hybrid cell extracts the ability to transcribe a human rDNA template </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These rescue experiments suggested that this required human-specific rDNA transcription factor(s) was effectively absent from the lines we examined and could account for nucleolar dominance in M greater than H hybrid cells </plain></SENT>
