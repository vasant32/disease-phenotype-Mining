<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Natural killer cells display spontaneous, non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells, which is strongly enhanced after incubation with IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular background of the increased anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> activity of these lymphokine-activated killer cells is still only partly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this paper, investigation has been made of the correlation between cell surface glycosylation and anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> activity of LAK cells by stimulating peripheral blood lymphocytes with interleukin-2, in the presence of inhibitors of N- and O-glycosylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inhibition of N- or O-glycosylation of proteins during IL-2 activation leads to a 70-80% decrease in the cytolytic activity of LAK cells against K562 and Daudi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells, coinciding with drastic alterations in their cell surface carbohydrate profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The conclusion is drawn that there is a clear correlation between the glycosylation of LAK cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> and their anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> activity which points to the involvement of cell surface glycoconjugates in the development of LAK activity </plain></SENT>
