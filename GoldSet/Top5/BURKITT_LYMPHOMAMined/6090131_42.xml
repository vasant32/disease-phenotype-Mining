<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have constructed a cDNA library from the cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> of Raji cells, a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line latently infected with Epstein-Barr virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here the characterization of a cDNA representing a spliced <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcribed from the IR1-U2 region of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cDNA is 1007 bp long </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 5' region contains three tandem repeats of two exons, 66 and 132 bp, which are transcribed from the IR1 repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3' region is formed from four exons transcribed from U2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An open reading frame extends from the 5' end to position 784, and includes the repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This reading frame presumably corresponds to the carboxy-terminal 261 amino acids of a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> containing several repeats of a 66 amino acid sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since it would be encoded by the IR1-U2 region of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome, the putative <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> might be involved in the process of growth-transformation of B-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
