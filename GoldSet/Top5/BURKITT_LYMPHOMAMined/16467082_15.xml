<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The ZAP-70 gene is normally expressed in T and natural killer cells, where it is required for the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More recently, it has been described that ZAP-70 contributes to the B-cell development at early stages of B-cell differentiation in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose was to investigate the presence of ZAP-70 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pro/pre B cells and mature B cells and in tumoral cells from B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ZAP-70 expression was ascertained by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, Western blot, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of ZAP-70 and other signaling proteins of the pre-TCR/TCR was done by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ZAP-70 was expressed in pro/pre B cells but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mature B cells derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or tonsil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among tumoral cells, ZAP-70 was expressed in 56% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALLs</z:e> with pro/pre B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> and in 4 of 6 Burkitt/ALL <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cells, expression of CD38 protein correlated with ZAP-70 expression (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutational analysis of the ZAP-70 gene revealed the absence of mutations in cases lacking ZAP-70 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, other elements of the pre-TCR/TCR signaling pathway, like LAT and Lck, were also found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell subsets, ZAP-70 was found expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pro/pre B cells but not in a significant proportion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells with mature phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the presence of ZAP-70 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALLs</z:e> probably reflects their cellular origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The lack of ZAP-70 expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mature B cells suggests that its expression in mature-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with different cellular origin, such as Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, might be due to an aberrant phenomenon </plain></SENT>
