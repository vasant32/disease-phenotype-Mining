<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Growth of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was markedly inhibited after an injection of 0.4 mg/kg IL-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The growth inhibition of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was found to be dose-dependent up to 0.4 mg/kg, reaching a plateau thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The loss of colony-forming ability of the cells and the <z:mp ids='MP_0000340'>loss of cell</z:mp> viability showed the same type of dose-dependence and progressed during 24 h following an injection of IL-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In accordance with these observations, histopathologic examination revealed progressively spreading coagulative <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Little infiltration of inflammatory cells into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-1 growth inhibition of T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in beige <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice having low natural killer activity was similar to that in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that the antitumor effects might not be produced through cell-mediated antitumor actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunocytological examination with anti-IL-1 antibody revealed that administered IL-1 was bound to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, suggesting that IL-1 receptor is probably expressed on these cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The antitumor action of IL-1 on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> may be exerted directly through the IL-1 receptor </plain></SENT>
