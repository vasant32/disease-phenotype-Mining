<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>10-20 G-banded metaphases, obtained from short-term cultures of unstimulated lymph++ node, bone marrow and blood cells were analyzed in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 18 patients only, the obtained metaphases were suitable for cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients (group A) karyotype was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or only single, +non-clonal aberrations were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 7 patients (group B) clonal aberrations were found, among them, in 3-structural changes of chromosome 1, but with different breakpoints: 1p31, 1p31, 1p36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The group of patients with chromosomal aberrations showed statistically significantly shorter survival time than the group without aberrations (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the former group more patients had low grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our observations confirm those data from the literature which indicate that the presence of chromosomal aberrations is a factor of poor prognosis, independent of other clinical and histopathological prognostic factors in non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
