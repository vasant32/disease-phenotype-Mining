<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 31 of the 35 precursor B <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) the rearrangements of the IgH gene involved sites between D regions 5' to DQ52 and JH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study of the IgH gene organization in 43 T lineage ALL showed nine cases with the rearrangement at the IgJH region, one of which involved the D region 5' to DQ52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When analyzed with another restriction enzyme (BglII), three of the remaining eight showed rearrangement between DQ52 and JH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining five samples rearrangement of the IgJH region was not shown, but the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) between MspI sites in 5'DQ52 loci was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus the RFLP in 5'DQ52 locus was identified and was distinguished from the recombination between DQ52 and JH in non-B lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
