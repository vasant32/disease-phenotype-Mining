<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When compared to LCLs derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells of the same patient, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-cell lines in set (i) generally showed a lower expression of HLA class I and class II antigens and a reduced ability to activate both allospecific and nonspecific (natural killer-like) cytotoxic responses when cocultured with peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the HLA antigen expression and in vitro stimulatory capacity of most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-cell lines in set (ii) were much closer to the values displayed by their corresponding LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since set (i) rather than set (ii) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines are phenotypically representative of the malignant cells as they exist in vivo, this work suggests that successful outgrowth of the virus-carrying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells in the affected host may be facilitated by the inability of these cells to stimulate strong cytotoxic responses </plain></SENT>
