<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cell line has undergone 80 passages over a period of 22 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cultured cells were positive for CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, and HLA-DR, and negative for CD10 and surface immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin gene analysis revealed rearrangements of JH and JK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T-cell antigens or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements were not observed on the cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SUBL cells were positive for Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EBV genome was detected in the original tissue and the cell line by the in situ hybridization method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that this cell line represents the B-cell lineage at a pre-B-cell stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SUBL cells showed successful heterotransplantation to mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal analysis revealed the karyotype 46,XY,t(2;3)(p11;q27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies showed that c-myc, N-myc, and bcl-2 were not rearranged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This cell line will provide a useful in vitro system to study the relationship between chromosomal abnormalities and the activation of cellular oncogenes </plain></SENT>
