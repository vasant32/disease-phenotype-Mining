<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently cloned a novel murine transcriptional repressor, the Kr√ºppel-like zinc finger protein AP-2rep (HGMW-approved symbol KLF12), that binds to a regulatory element in the AP-2alpha gene promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we characterize the human AP-2rep homolog and describe expression patterns in human urogenital and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The predicted human protein of 402 amino acids exhibits 95.8% identity and 98.5% similarity to the murine AP-2rep <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genomic locus of human AP-2rep consists of seven exons and was assigned to chromosome 13q22 by fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human AP-2rep repressed both reporter expression from a transiently transfected AP-2alpha promoter and the endogenous AP-2alpha gene and inversely was negatively regulated by AP-2alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The consensus motif CAGTGGG was identified by an in vitro binding site selection assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, our data further point to an important role of AP-2rep as a transcriptional silencer and reveal reciprocal regulation of AP-2alpha and AP-2rep </plain></SENT>
