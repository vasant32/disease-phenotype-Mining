<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of the p53 gene are the most common molecular lesions in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and may be of prognostic significance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the p53 gene status in a group of patients with ALL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> to determine whether some types of mutants were more frequent in this selected group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We selected a group of 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) in order to investigate the presence of p53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA obtained from affected organs (bone marrow, lymph node and a renal mass) was used for the molecular studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 5 to 9 of the gene was used to detect p53 mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After detecting an abnormal migration pattern on the SSCP, mutations were determined by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Point mutations were found in eight patients; a misense mutation in seven cases and a non-sense mutation in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele was also identified in 7 mutated samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The same mutation at codon 282 was identified in three different patients, in whom an identical conformer was detected after SSCP analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mutation at codon 282 was present in an extramedular relapse (renal) appearing after a BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No such alteration was present in the bone marrow analyzed at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that p53 mutations are quite frequent in recognized clinical groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The criteria chosen in this study allowed us to identify a high percentage of the samples with mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Different malignant phenotypes could be determined by functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of p53 mutants </plain></SENT>
