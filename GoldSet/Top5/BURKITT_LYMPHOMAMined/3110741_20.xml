<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A detailed molecular analysis of both reciprocal recombination products of the variant t(2;8) chromosomal translocation of the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> derived cell line JI and their germline counterparts was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint on chromosome 8 is localized 28 kb to the 3' side of the c-myc protooncogene, the breakpoint on chromosome 2 was found to be within an aberrantly rearranged VK gene (abbreviations ref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Novel features of the immunoglobulin moiety involved in this process include insertion of extra <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> in the V-J junction which have the characteristics of a N segment as it has been found up to now only in heavy chain and T cell receptor genes; the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in 8q+ and not in 2p- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data allow a reconstruction of the course of events in the cell line JI; remarkable sequence regularities at the chromosomal breakpoints consisting of symmetrically placed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> and elements related to the hepta- and nonanucleotide recombinase recognition sequences are discussed in the context of the translocation mechanism </plain></SENT>
