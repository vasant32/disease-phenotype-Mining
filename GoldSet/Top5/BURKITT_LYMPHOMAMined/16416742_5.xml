<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little proteomic study has been done in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined whether the expression of a set of proteins by protein-chip technology coupled with new informatics tools could be used to build a model to molecularly classify B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to analyze 18 CD10+ B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including 6 grade 1 (G1) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs), 7 grade 3 (G3) FLs, and 5 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used 7 reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> cases as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By using SAX2 ProteinChip arrays (Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont, CA), we found a unique protein expression profile for each type of lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-way hierarchical clustering analysis of these protein expression profiles differentiated reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, FL, and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, with 5 major clusters of differentially expressed protein peaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we identified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H4 as a potential differentially expressed protein marker that seems to distinguish G1 from G3 FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first proteomic study using protein-chip technology for molecular classification of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes with clinical samples </plain></SENT>
