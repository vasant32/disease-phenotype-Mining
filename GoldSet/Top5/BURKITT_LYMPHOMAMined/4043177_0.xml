<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve non-neoplastic lymph nodes and 88 malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-neoplastic lymph nodes had significantly lower levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three enzymes than those found in high-grade malignant NHL (the P value ranged from less than 0.02 to less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lymphoblastic and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were the groups with the highest levels of the three enzymes </plain></SENT>
