<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The German reference centres for hematopathology collected 220 retrospective cases of aggressive mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> whose classification according to the current World Health Organisation criteria was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene expression analysis (Affymetrix) was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and chromosomal translocations were determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal losses and gains were analysed by matrix comparative genomic hybridisation and clinical data were successfully collected for most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The application of a novel bioinformatics method led to the identification of a stable and reproducible gene expression signature specific for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 44 cases were identified by this molecular signature [designated molecular Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (mBL)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These molecular Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunohistology of classical or atypical Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases in 29 instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, 15 of the molecular Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases had the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or could not be further specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> molecular Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed an expression of BCL-6 and CD10, but a MYC translocation was not demonstrable in more than 10% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of significance is that more than 20% of the molecular Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> expressed BCL-2, although weakly in most instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that: (1) the morphological, immunophenotypical and genetic spectrum of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is broader than previously expected, and (2) our molecular Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> signature enables a more precise and extended definition this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
