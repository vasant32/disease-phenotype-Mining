<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently identified a novel CCAAT box binding protein (ICBP90) involved in the regulation of topoisomerase IIalpha gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have observed that it is expressed in non-tumoral proliferating human lung fibroblast cells whereas in HeLa cells, a tumoral cell line, ICBP90 was still present even when cells were at confluence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have determined the ICBP90 gene structure by screening of a human placenta genomic library and PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report that the ICBP90 gene spans about 35.8 kb and contains six coding exons named A to F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 5' upstream sequence of the region containing the coding exons, two additional exons (I and II) were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, an internal splicing site was found in exon A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A promoter region, including three putative Sp1 binding sites between exons I and A, was identified by transient transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines revealed the existence of two ICBP90 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species of 5.1 and 4.3 kb that are transcribed from the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative amounts of these <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> depended on the cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In MOLT-4 cells and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji cells, the 4.3 kb or the 5.1 kb transcripts were mainly observed, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In other cell lines, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> K-562, <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinoma</z:mp> A549, HeLa or colorectal SW480, both 4.3 and 5.1 kb forms of ICBP90 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, western blot analysis showed several ICBP90 protein bands in HeLa but only a single band in MOLT-4 cell extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Taken together our results are consistent with the ICBP90 gene exhibiting alternative splicing and promoter usage in a cell-specific manner </plain></SENT>
