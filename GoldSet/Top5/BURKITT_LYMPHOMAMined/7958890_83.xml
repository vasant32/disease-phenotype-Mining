<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> and human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, one allele of c-myc is translocated into one of the immunoglobulin loci, resulting in a characteristic pattern of deregulated c-myc transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Translocation events between c-myc and the IgH locus segregate c-myc and the IgH intron enhancer to different reciprocal products in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> and in most Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, suggesting that an additional element(s) capable of affecting c-myc expression over a large and variable distance must exist in the IgH locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The region 3' of the IgH C alpha gene contains four tissue-specific and cell stage-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites (HSs), two of which map to the late B cell-specific 3' C alpha enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here that DNA sequences comprising the two other 3' C alpha HSs contain potential protein-binding motifs for trans-activators commonly associated with immunoglobulin enhancers and that these sites can function as cell stage-specific enhancers in transient B cell assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A DNA fragment containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four HSs (HS1234) synergistically activates c-myc transcription in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in transient assays and induces high-level transcription, a promoter shift from P2 to P1, and an increase in readthrough transcription in stable transfections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> clones stably transfected with a HS1234-linked c-myc construct express c-myc in a position-independent, copy number-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that HS1234 may function as a locus control region (LCR), deregulating c-myc expression in t(15;12) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo>, as well as potentially contributing to aspects of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IgH chain expression </plain></SENT>
