<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these latent antigens, the immunodominant CTL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> in EBNA3B (EBNA3B 399-408 and EBNA3B 416-424) are well characterized </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most EBV in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) from healthy Japanese donors exhibited the prototype A sequence, with mutations in approximately 20% (3/16) </plain></SENT>
