<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Different studies have already shown that the isolated inactivation of p21, p16, or p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) is associated with increased growth fraction, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>, or decreased overall survival in cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we linked molecular study of the p53 and p16 genes with immunohistochemical analysis of p27 expression in a group of aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> [large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (LBCLs) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was done to analyze the relationship between p53 and p16 silencing, p27 anomalous overexpression, and clinical follow-up, testing the hypothesis that the accumulation of CKI alterations could confer to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> a higher aggressivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a group of 62 patients, p53 inactivation as a result of mutation was observed in 11 cases (18%) and p16 silencing was seen in 27 cases (43.5%) as a result of methylation (20 of 62), 9p21 deletion (7 of 44), or p16 mutation (2 of 62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous inactivation of p53 and p16 was detected exclusively in five LBCL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anomalous expression of p27, which has been proven to be associated with the absence of p27/CDK2 complexes and the formation of p27/cyclin D3 complexes where p27 is inactivated, was detected in 19 of 61 cases (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases characterized by p27 anomalous expression display concurrent inactivation of p21 (provided by p53 mutations) and/or p16 CKIs in 11 of 14 LBCL cases (P = 0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the relationship between the association of inactivated CKIs and overall survival was considered, a significant relationship was found between a lower overall survival probability and an increased number of inactivated CKIs in LBCL cases, with the worst prognosis for the cases displaying concurrent p53, p16, and p27 alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This proves that simultaneous inactivation of different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor pathways does indeed take place, and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> takes advantage of this CKI-concerted silencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this same series of data, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients seem to behave in a different way than LBCLs, with p53 and p16 alteration being mutually exclusive and the association with p27 anomalous expression not being clinically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These facts seem to support that the additive effect of the inactivation of different CKIs could be dependent of the histological type </plain></SENT>
