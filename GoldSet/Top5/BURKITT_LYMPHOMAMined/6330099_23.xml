<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cell line T98G is sensitive to the antiproliferative activity of both alpha- and gamma-interferons (IFNs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific binding of a homogeneous 125I-IFN-alpha 2 probe to high-affinity membrane receptors (apparent Kd = 6.2 X 10(-10) M) can be decreased by pretreatment of these cells with human IFN-gamma (HuIFN-gamma, derived by recombinant DNA techniques) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The regulation of HuIFN-alpha 2 binding by such pretreatment is reflected by subsequent inhibition of both the antiviral and antiproliferative activities of HuIFN-alpha 2 on T98G cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, binding of HuIFN-gamma to its distinct cell-surface receptor can modify expression of the separate IFN-alpha receptor, presumably through an indirect effect on the apparent Kd of the IFN-alpha 2 receptor-ligand interaction </plain></SENT>
