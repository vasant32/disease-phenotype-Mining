<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results show that there is no correlation between gp350-specific ADCC-mediating antibody titers and MIF or EBV neutralizing antibody titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For example, sera from patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e>, while positive by MIF assay or EBV neutralization test, were not reactive in the ADCC assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results also show that nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) patients on MIF present high IgG titers against gp350 compared with healthy persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-gp350 IgA antibodies were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups tested; however, titers were highest in the NPC group </plain></SENT>
