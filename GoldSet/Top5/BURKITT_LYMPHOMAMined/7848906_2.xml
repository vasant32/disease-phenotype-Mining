<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After removal of DMSO, the cells reenter the cell cycle in a synchronous manner and proliferate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 5.5 days incubation in DMSO, S phase entry occurs at about 21-24 h after release, which is about the length of the first G1 phase of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human lymphocytes which are stimulated in vitro to enter the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The G0-like state of arrested cells and the sequence of events occurring after release from DMSO mimic, in most ways studied, those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arrested Raji cells lack many cell cycle-regulated molecules, including cyclin A, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and the p34cdc2 kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They contain only hypophosphorylated p110Rb and a low level of enzymatically inactive p33cdk2 kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After reentering the cell cycle, a series of events occurred, including phosphorylation of p110Rb and accumulation of the cyclin A and proliferating cell nuclear antigen proteins in mid-G1 and the accumulation of the p33cdk2 and p34cdc2 proteins beginning in late G1, just prior to S-phase entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cyclin E levels in Raji cells appeared to be less regulated than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, with high levels of this protein being present in resting cells and throughout the entire cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The time courses of activation of the p34cdc2 and p33cdk2 kinases were similar; both became detectable at about 21 h after release and increased greatly in early S.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
