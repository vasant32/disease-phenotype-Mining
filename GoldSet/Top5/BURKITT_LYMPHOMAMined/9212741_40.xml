<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>p27KIP1, which has a high degree of similarity with p21WAF1, is a general CDKI thought to be involved in G1 arrest in response to agents that inhibit cell cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were 1) to establish the pattern of expression of p27KIP1 protein in nontumor lymphoid tissue, 2) to determine whether p27KIP1 is involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, and 3) to address the possible relationship between p27KIP1 and p21WAF1 expression in reactive and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p27KIP1 protein was found to be mainly present in quiescent lymphocytes in reactive lymphoid tissue as well as in peripheral blood lymphocytes, with an inverse expression for p27KIP1 and Ki-67 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same p27KIP1 expression pattern was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, independently of histological type; small resting cells were p27KIP1 positive, and large proliferating cells were p27KIP1 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a low proliferative index were mostly positive, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> characterized by a higher growth fraction bad low p27KIP1 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An unexpected finding was the existence of a group of six cases of high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (three diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and three Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) with homogeneously strong staining for p27KIP1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 of these cases belong to a group of 28 cases characterized by blockage of the p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor pathway, as determined by genetic (p53 mutation) or immunophenotypic studies (p53+/p21-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>p27KIP1 expression was not seen in any case of aggressive non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with an intact p53 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that p27KIP1 is down-regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a high proliferative index, although it is highly expressed in high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with defects in the p53 pathway </plain></SENT>
