<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells on newborn genetic screening cards ("Guthrie cards") of a small group of patients and several sets of identical twins developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) with identical phenotypic and chromosomal markers has provided evidence that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> cases may arise in utero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective study of a randomly selected group of childhood B-precursor ALL patients to determine the frequency of the presence of "leukemic" clones prenatally in ALL cases by testing newborn screening cards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 17 ALL patients analyzed had a median age of 46 months (range, 18 months to 13 years) and had median presenting white blood cell (WBC) counts of 10 950/microL (range, 2900-70 300/microL) at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A clonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene was identified in diagnostic lymphoblasts and sequenced and patient-specific primers were used to amplify DNA from blood samples on the patient's newborn screening cards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the 17 (71%) analyzed newborn cards had detectable IgH rearrangements amplified by seminested polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing confirmed that the IgH rearrangements detected matched the IgH sequences identified from diagnostic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, indicating the presence of a "leukemic" clone at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in age or presenting WBC counts between the cases with or without positive newborn screening cards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 patients with hyperdiploid ALL had detectable "leukemic" clones on their cards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of our study support the notion that a high proportion of childhood B-precursor ALL cases arise in utero, although postnatal events are also important factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
