<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here a novel gene named TELB which is located on human chromosomal band 6p21 and encodes a protein highly related to <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TELB is widely expressed in different tissues and, similarly to <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> encodes a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor </plain></SENT>
