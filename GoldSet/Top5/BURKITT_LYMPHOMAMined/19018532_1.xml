<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our laboratory previously demonstrated that PPARgamma ligands induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While malignant B lineage cells such as B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> express PPARgamma, its physiological function remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Herein, we demonstrate that silencing PPARgamma expression by RNAi in human Burkitt's type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells increased basal and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-induced proliferation and survival, which was accompanied by enhanced NF-kappaB activity and increased expression of Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells also had increased survival upon exposure to PPARgamma ligands and exhibited a less differentiated phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, PPARgamma overexpression in B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells inhibited cell growth and decreased their proliferative response to mitogenic stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cells were also more sensitive to PPARgamma-ligand induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and displayed a more differentiated phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these findings support a regulatory role for PPARgamma in the proliferation, survival and differentiation of malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings further suggest the potential of PPARgamma as a therapeutic target for B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
