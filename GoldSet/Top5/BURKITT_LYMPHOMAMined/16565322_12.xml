<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemokine receptors transduce intracellular signals by activating heterotrimeric G-proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Acting to limit and modulate heterotrimeric G-protein signaling is a family of proteins, termed regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of these proteins, RGS1 and RGS13, are well-expressed in germinal center B cells and many Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reducing RGS13 and to a lesser extent RGS1 expression in a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line enhances responsiveness to two chemokines, CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) and CXCL13, and reducing both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> augments the responses more dramatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The double knock-down (KD) cells respond better to restimulation with CXCL12 or CXCL13 after a primary stimulation with CXCL12 than do the control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The double-KD cells also exhibit a greater propensity to polarize and to develop multiple small lamellipodia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that RGS1 and RGS13 act together to regulate chemokine receptor signaling in human germinal center B lymphocytes and provide evidence that they contribute significantly to the rapid desensitization of the signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
