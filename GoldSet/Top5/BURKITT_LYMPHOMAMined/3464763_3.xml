<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005360'>urolithiasis</z:mp> was suggested by excretory urograms that showed <z:mp ids='MP_0003587'>obstructive uropathy</z:mp> (4 patients) and by computerized tomography scans that demonstrated ureterovesical obstruction (1 patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100519'>anuria</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
