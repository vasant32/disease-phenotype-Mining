<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we compared the relative diagnostic values of EBV DNA load monitoring in unfractionated whole blood and simultaneously obtained serum or plasma samples from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) patients, transplant recipients, human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV)-infected individuals, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (IM) patients by a quantitative competitive PCR (Q-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EBV DNA load in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients was mainly situated in the cellular blood compartment (up to 4.5 x 10(6) copies/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBV DNA loads in unfractionated whole blood and parallel serum samples showed no correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In transplant recipients, IM patients, and HIV-infected patients, the EBV burden in the circulation was almost exclusively restricted to the cellular blood compartment, because serum or plasma samples from these patients yielded negative results by Q-PCR, despite high <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> loads in corresponding whole-blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 10-fold more sensitive but qualitative BamHI-W-repeat PCR occasionally revealed the presence of EBV at &lt;2,000 copies of EBV DNA per ml of serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spiking of 100 copies of EBV DNA in samples with negative Q-PCR results excluded the presence of inhibitory factors in serum or plasma that influenced the Q-PCR result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum samples from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> populations were often positive for beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> DNA, indicating cell damage in vivo or during serum preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that serum is an undesirable clinical specimen for EBV DNA load monitoring because it omits the presence of cell-associated virus and uncontrolled cell lysis may give irreproducible results or overestimation of the DNA load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unfractionated whole blood is strongly preferred since it combines <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> blood compartments that may harbor EBV and it best reflects the absolute <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> burden in the patient's circulation </plain></SENT>
