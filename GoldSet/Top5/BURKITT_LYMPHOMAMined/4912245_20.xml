<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cell cultures with 10(6) viable cells/ml were incubated at 33 C for 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amount of virus in both the cell and fluid portions of the cultures was determined by the loop-drop particle-counting procedure with electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An apparent growth curve of the virus was constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximal cell-associated virus, 10(10) virus particles in an 80-ml culture, was observed after 9 days of incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximal extracellular virus, 2.5 x 10(9) particles per culture, was observed at the 12th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>About 10% of the released virus particles were enveloped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, there was little or no cell multiplication, but the percentage of immunofluorescent cells reactive to a selected human serum (probably indicating the presence of virus in the cells) increased to a maximum of 50% at the 9th day </plain></SENT>
