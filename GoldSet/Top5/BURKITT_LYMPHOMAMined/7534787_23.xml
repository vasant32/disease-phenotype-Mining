<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Earlier studies showed that anti-IgM mAb treatment triggers apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell line, Ramos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that two B cell surface molecules, CD19 and CD22, which have been reported to interact either functionally or structurally with the B cell Ag receptor, also stimulate cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicide</z:e> when sufficiently aggregated, both in the Ramos and EBV-infected Ramos AW cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In conditions of lower cross-linking, both molecules enhance the apoptotic response induced by a suboptimal dose of anti-IgM mAb in Ramos cells, reinforcing the notion that CD19 and CD22 may be involved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathway and modulate Ag-induced B cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar outcomes were obtained with human tonsillar B cells, which enter the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> program upon treatment with cross-linked anti-IgM, -CD19, or -CD22 mAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that Ag-induced B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicide</z:e> may affect mature B cells in the periphery and may be regulated via the interaction of CD19 and/or CD22 with their respective ligand(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early tyrosine phosphorylations were analyzed by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The biologic outcome of these various treatments--cell survival or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>--could not be related to any detectable new tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate, further questioning the biochemical basis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> signaling </plain></SENT>
