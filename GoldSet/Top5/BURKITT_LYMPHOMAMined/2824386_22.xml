<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the virus strain used for conversion, the BLEc lines induced a considerably stronger primary MLC response than their EBV-negative parentals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only the BLEc lines were able to maintain T-lymphocyte proliferation in repeated stimulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The low proliferative response observed in cultures stimulated with BLE- cells was not due to the generation of suppressor cells or to the release of inhibitory factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increased stimulatory capacity of BLEc lines was unrelated to changes in expression of MHC class-I and class-II antigen, or of B-cell activation markers, and was not due to the reactivation of EBV-specific memory T cells, since lymphocytes from EBV-seropositive and seronegative donors responded similarly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the capacity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells to elicit cellular immune responses may be influenced by their EBV-carrying status </plain></SENT>
