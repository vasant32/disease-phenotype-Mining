<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, the c-myc oncogene is repositioned next to the Emu enhancer of the immunoglobulin (Ig) locus, due to chromosomal translocation, and up-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PNAEmu linked to a nuclear localization signal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was shown specifically to block c-myc hyperexpression by inhibiting cell growth in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported that the administration of PNAEmu to mice, following inoculation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, hinders <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> without toxic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the potential use of PNAEmu in clinical applications further, we tested its antigenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice were inoculated with an emulsion of free <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> crosslinked to the immunogenic carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) with Freund's adjuvant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to free <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> were undetected, whereas both IgG and IgM antibodies to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>-KLH were detected in mouse serum 28 and 38 days after inoculation </plain></SENT>
