<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the regulation of activation-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (AICD) in B cells we used a cell line model consisting of an Epstein-Barr virus-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (BL41), which is highly sensitive, and a subclone which is resistant to sIgM-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (BL41/B5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resistance in this cell line was not due to down-regulation of sIgM or functional impairment in signal transduction of the surface Ig complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The zinc finger transcription factor nur77 has been implicated to play an important role in CD3-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in murine T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We were able to demonstrate that surface IgM ligation and subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in BL41 cells is associated with a concomitant induction of NAK-1, the human nur77 homologue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction of NAK-1 mRNA and DNA binding activity in the nucleus could be readily observed by means of Northern blot and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the resistant clone BL41/B5 did not show any NAK-1 expression upon stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests a role for NAK-1 in sIgM-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of immature B cells </plain></SENT>
