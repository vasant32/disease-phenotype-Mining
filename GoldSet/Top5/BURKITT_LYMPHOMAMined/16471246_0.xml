<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to a few reports on this preoblem, the aim of this study was to compare histological findings to cytomorphological ones in needle aspirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also compared these findings to the overal survival (OS) time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> biopsies of peripheral lymph nodes, and the International Prognostic Index (IPI) in 81 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We put these findings into correlation with OS time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the International Working Formulation (IWF) criteria, the dominant cell population was asfollows: 18 patients had the small cell population, 21 patients had small cleaved cells, 18 patients had the mixed cell population, 21 patients had large cell population, 2 patients had Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> type, and 1 patient had the dominant lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On presentation, 32 patients had a low IPI index, 32 patients had a low intermediate, and 17 patients had a high intermediate IPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We confirmed the statistical significance (Kaplan-Mayer) of cytomorphology (p = 0.013) and IPI index (p = 0.016) for survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a 48-month follow-up, OS was 37.2 months for the patients with the dominant small cells, and 32 months for the patients with small cleaved cells (PH equivalent to indolent NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the patients with the dominant mixed cell population, large cell population and Burkitt limphoma cell, OS were 17, 14.4, and 9.3 months, respectively (PH equivalent to aggressive NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with low IPI had the highest OS, 36 months for the low intermediate and only 11.6 months for the high intermediate IPI index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We concluded that an initial cytological and clinical profile of patients with NHL, might give a quick and relevant information for planning an adequate therapy </plain></SENT>
