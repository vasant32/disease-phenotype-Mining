<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study describes the identification and characterization of antisense oligonucleotides to Stat6 as an approach to interrupt IL-4 and IL-13 signaling and thereby to attenuate germline Cepsilon transcription, a prerequisite to IgE synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A limited gene-walk was performed with chemically modified oligonucleotides to identify sequences capable of downregulating both human and murine Stat6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A chimeric oligonucleotide (9b, base sequence GTGAGGTCCTGTTCAGTGGG) demonstrated high levels of antisense activity in both species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further characterization of 9b showed a dose-dependent Stat6 <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) and protein downregulation (concentration that produces 50% inhibition of effect = 168 and 215 nM, respectively) through a ribonuclease H-dependent antisense mechanism with no effect on closely related members of the Stat family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, pretreatment of DND39 cells (human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line) with oligonucleotide 9b before IL-4 stimulation successfully downregulated germline Cepsilon transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because Stat6 represents an attractive but technically challenging drug discovery target, antisense oligonucleotides may provide an alternative approach to low molecular-weight compounds for inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 signaling </plain></SENT>
