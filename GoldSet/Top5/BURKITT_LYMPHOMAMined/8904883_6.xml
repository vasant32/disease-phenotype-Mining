<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed a simplified fluorescent run-off (FluRO) based IgH PCR strategy in order to facilitate follow-up of large numbers of B-cell precursor (BCP) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> (ALL) in a routine molecular diagnostic laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA samples from 26 BCP-ALL and one B-cell line were amplified using IgH FR1 and FR2 consensus primers and analysed in parallel either by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4883">ethidium bromide</z:chebi> non-denaturing PAGE or, after rendering the PCR products fluorescent with an internal JH consensus primer, by high-resolution analysis on an automated fragment analyser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter led to a minimum of one log increase in sensitivity of detection in 62% of alleles from 19 samples (16/28 in FR1; 11/15 in FR2) tested in parallel on log DNA dilutions, and to at least a 10(-2) level of sensitivity of detection in 15/19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The improved resolution allowed an approximate 20% increase in the number of clonal alleles detected, and consequently doubled the incidence of oligoclonality (6/26; 23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using these strategies, 6/17 (35%) of children analysed prospectively showed residual IgH positivity in the post induction complete remission bone marrow sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred within this subgroup of patients and of the three of four surviving patients tested, two remained positive 2-3 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although this simplified strategy is, as expected, less sensitive than anti-V-D-J junction specific strategies, it enables detection of a category of 'slow-remitters' which may have prognostic significance at a stage where therapeutic decisions are taken </plain></SENT>
