<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those obtained by the conventional immunofluorescence assays against the EBV-specified early antigens and capsid antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antigenic specificity of the immunoblotting assay for IgG antibody against the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> enzyme, but not that for the IgA antibody, was correlated with DNAase-inhibitory activity of the sera and their titers of IgG antibodies against the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> early antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Purified IgA as well as IgG from NPC sera inhibited enzyme activity with similar efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The use of highly purified <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNase has increased the sensitivity of detection of the corresponding antibodies by immunoblotting, with the IgG antibody being detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one, and IgA antibody in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2, of the 174 NPC sera tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IgG antibody was also commonly detected in the other groups of control sera, while the IgA antibody was detected in about 10% of African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Algerian Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients and less than 3% of the other control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that IgA antibody against recombinant EBV DNAase may be useful in the diagnosis of NPC, but the level of this antibody did not appear to be related to clinical stages of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
