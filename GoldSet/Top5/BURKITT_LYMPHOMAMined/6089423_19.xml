<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ability of the cloned defective DNA fragments to induce EBV antigens in transfected baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells was tested using indirect immunofluorescence assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Up to 5% of those cells receiving a defective DNA fragment BamHI-W'C' transiently expressed a de novo nuclear antigen which was identified as being a component of the EAD complex by its reactivity with characterized EBV-positive human sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A 20-kb clone of P3HR-1 defective DNA (EcoRI-C1) was found to induce the synthesis of a component of the VCA complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One percent of cells transfected with this clone showed cytoplasmic fluorescence when tested with either VCA+ human sera or EBV anti-VCA monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subcloning of the EcoRI-C1 fragment localized the VCA gene to a 4.1-kb segment which maps within the BamHI-A fragment of the standard genome </plain></SENT>
