<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Detailed immunophenotypic analyses of immunologically classified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed that CD40 displays an exquisite B-lineage specificity within the human lymphopoietic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Notably, 82% of B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (CLLs), 82% of B-lineage hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (HCLs), 86% of B-lineage non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs), and 29% of B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (ALLs) were CD40+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analyses of the correlated expression of CD40 and other B-lineage differentiation antigens on fetal lymphoid precursor cells by multiparameter two-color/three-color flow cytometry, combined with analyses of sequential antigen expression on fluorescence-activated cell fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) isolated immunologically distinct fetal B-cell precursor subpopulations during in vitro proliferation and differentiation, provided evidence that the acquisition of CD40 antigen in human B-cell ontogeny occurs subsequent to the expression of CD10 and CD19 antigens but before the surface expression of CD20, CD21, CD22, CD24, and surface immunoglobulin M (sIgM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some leukemic pro-B cells from ALL patients as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pro-B cell clones from fetal livers displaying germline Ig heavy chain genes were CD40+, indicating that the acquisition of CD40 antigen likely precedes the rearrangement of Ig heavy chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD40+ FACS-sorted malignant cells from B-lineage ALL as well as B-lineage NHL patients were capable of in vitro clonogenic growth, indicating the CD40 antigen is expressed on clonogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was confirmed by the ability of an anti-CD40 immunotoxin that we used as an antigen-specific cytotoxic probe to effectively kill clonogenic B-lineage ALL and NHL cells </plain></SENT>
