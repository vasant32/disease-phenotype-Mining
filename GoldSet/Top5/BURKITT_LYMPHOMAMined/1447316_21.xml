<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> induced in BM13674 cells by these diverse agents was markedly inhibited by 1 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44658">okadaic acid</z:chebi>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> promoter that inhibits protein phosphatases 1 and 2A </plain></SENT>
