<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In case of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> of B cell origin and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) transformed B cells, it is invariably found that these cells proliferate in the apparent absence of signals from T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many of transformed B cells tested appear to be refractory to the proliferative effects of a number of defined cytokines including IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, TNF alpha, lymphotoxin and IFN gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported on the molecular cloning of a T cell derived human B cell growth factor, BCGF-12kD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that recombinant BCGF-12kD induces proliferation in EBV negative undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cell line, MC116 and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cell line, P3HR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mouse monoclonal antibody produced against a BCGF-12kD synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> neutralizes the BCGF activity present in the MC116 conditioned media as well as inhibits the in vitro growth of MC116 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PCR analysis of the BCGF-12kD gene transcription provides further evidence that MC116 cells express the BCGF-12kD gene, whereas this gene is silent in resting and anti-IgM activated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data clearly suggest an immunoregulatory role of BCGF-12kD in transformed human B cells </plain></SENT>
