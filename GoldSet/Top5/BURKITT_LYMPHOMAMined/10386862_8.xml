<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, IL-7 stimulates the proliferation of both antitumor reactive cells and a number of T and B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, underlining its significance for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its exact role in the process of pathologic maturation of lymphocytes and regulation of the immune response is not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As alternative splicing of pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> has been shown to be involved in the control of gene expression, and splicing-derived protein isoforms with antagonistic activity have been found, we assessed the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-expression of IL-7 and its previously described alternative splice variant lacking exon 4, IL-7delta4, in leukemic cells from children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCR of full-length IL-7 cDNA enabling the competitive amplification of both variants led to the amplification of diverse unexpected PCR products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sequence data demonstrated the existence of three additional in-frame splice variants resulting from exon skipping of exon 3 or exon 5 or both in combination with exon 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We named these IL-7delta3/4, IL-7delta4/5, and IL-7delta3/4/5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, three out-of-frame splice variants were identified, IL-7(-56bpExon2), IL-7delta4(-56bpExon2), and IL-7delta3/4/5(-56bpExon2), in which, in addition to the aforementioned exon skipping, 56 bp of the 3' end of exon 2 are omitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results led us to assume that splicing-derived IL-7 isoforms play a potential role in modulating IL-7-mediated biologic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to clarify the significance of the diverse IL-7 protein isoforms for the regulation of IL-7 function and the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
