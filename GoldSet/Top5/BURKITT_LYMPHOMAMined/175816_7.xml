<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A similar response was observed in seven of the lines irrespective of their concentration of cytoplasmic receptors and pharmacological doses of steroid, well above those required to saturate receptors in cell-free extracts, were required for a massive lethal response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One cell line derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was refractory to lethal effects even with pharmacological doses of steroid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A similar unresponsiveness to the cytolethal effect of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> in vitro was observed in fresh lymphoblasts derived from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> despite evidence of a satisfactory clinical response to therapy which included steroid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resistance of human lymphoblastoid cells to treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> in vitro may result from a defect in activation subsequent to the binding of steroid to cytoplasmic receptors </plain></SENT>
