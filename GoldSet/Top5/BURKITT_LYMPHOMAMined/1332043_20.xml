<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The subcellular distribution of the small Epstein-Barr virus-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> EBER-1 and EBER-2 has been investigated by using a high-resolution in situ hybridization technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution patterns in Raji cells of fluorescent oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to each <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> were detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> were found in the cytoplasm as well as in the nuclei of interphase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, use of the same technique indicated an exclusively nuclear location for cellular U2 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the cytoplasm distribution of the EBERs was similar to that of the double-stranded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-dependent protein kinase, to which these <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> can bind, and was coincident with the rough endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cells undergoing mitosis the EBERs became localized around the chromosomes, whereas the protein kinase remained uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A cytoplasmic location for EBER-1 and EBER-2 in interphase cells is consistent with the evidence for a role for these small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> in translational control </plain></SENT>
