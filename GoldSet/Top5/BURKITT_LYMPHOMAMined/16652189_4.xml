<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Survivin is the smallest member of mammalian IAP (inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>) family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is ubiquitous during embryonic development but is not expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> post-natal tissues, except the thymus, colonic epithelial cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its expression is upregulated during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> in both solid organ and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference with short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (shRNA) technique to inhibit survivin expression in a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji and validated its effects on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A survivin-shRNA expression vector were constructed and introduced into Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of survivin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein was assessed by RT-PCR and western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> index of transfected cells was quantified by flow cytometry and cell proliferation was enumerated by trypan blue exclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Raji cells treated with survivin-shRNA expression vector, survivin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were significantly reduced by 67.14% (transient transfection) and 64.28% (stable transfection) respectively, compared with control-shRNA treated group and PBS treated group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels of survivin protein were significantly reduced by 62.50% (transient transfection) and 60.93% (stable transfection), compared with the two control groups (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> index was significantly increased during transient transfection and stable transfection, respectively 31.20+/-2.45% and 29.40+/-1.72% (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survivin-shRNA inhibited the proliferation of Raji cells of stable transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the vector-based survivin-shRNA can effectively reduce the expression of survivin gene and induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and growth inhibition of transfected Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We suggest that survivin can be regarded as an ideal target for new anticancer intervention of NHL </plain></SENT>
