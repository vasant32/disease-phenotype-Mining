<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Less is known about the biological consequences of B-cell signaling through <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and its two receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have used Ramos germinal center (GC)-derived Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells as a model system to compare some of the early signaling events of TNF-alpha and CD40L on the NF-kappaB and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have previously found that both TNF-alpha and CD40L induced enhanced cell aggregation, adherence and modified cell surface <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present report, it was found that treatment with either TNF-alpha or CD40L resulted in a rapid degradation (within 15 min) of IkappaBalpha, followed by a recovery period lasting up to a few hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of IkappaBbeta, another inhibitory molecule of the NF-kappaB pathway, also decreased following treatment with CD40L or TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, whereas CD40L induced a rapid drop without significant recovery within 2 h, TNF-alpha caused a slow and gradual decline of IkappaBbeta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, treatment with CD40L resulted in a gradual and modest decline of up to 60% of the level of IkappaBepsilon within 2 h, whereas a much smaller decline was seen with TNF-alpha (approx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>20%) Our results thus show that in Ramos cells, TNF-alpha and CD40L have common, as well as differential, signaling effects on the IkappaBalpha, IkappaBbeta and IkappaBepsilon, which form inhibitory complex(es) with the NF-kappaB cytosolic proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also found that CD40L, but not TNF-alpha activates the JNK pathway through transient phosphorylation of its threonine183/tyrosine185 residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As expected, c-Jun, which is known to be a substrate of JNK, was also phosphorylated at <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32848">serine residue</z:chebi> 73 by treatment with CD40L, but not by TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
