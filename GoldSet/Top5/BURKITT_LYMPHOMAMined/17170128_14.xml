<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared the gene expression profile of adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic and non-ALL samples using oligonucleotide arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was the highest overexpressed gene in B-cell ALL compared with the other groups, and displayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> expression, suggesting it might have prognostic relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CTGF expression was examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (ORT-PCR) on 79 adult ALL specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CTGF expression levels were significantly increased in ALL cases with B-lineage (P &lt; .001), unfavorable cytogenetics (P &lt; .001), and blasts expressing CD34 (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate proportional hazards model, higher CTGF expression levels corresponded to worsening of overall survival (OS; hazard ratio 1.36, for each 10-fold increase in expression; P = .019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further studies are ongoing to confirm the prognostic value of CTGF expression in ALL and to investigate its role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal lymphocyte biology </plain></SENT>
