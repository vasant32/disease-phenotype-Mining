<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ricin intoxicates cells by binding through its B-chain to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi>-terminated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> found on the surface of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eukaryotic cells and then transferring its A-chain to the cytosol where it disrupts protein synthesis by inactivating ribosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to binding, the B-chain plays an important, but not yet understood, role in the translocation of the A-chain through a cellular membrane to the cytosol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blocking the two <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi>-binding sites of native ricin by chemical modification with affinity ligands created an altered toxin, called blocked ricin, that has at least a 3500-fold lower binding affinity and is more than 1000-fold less cytotoxic than native ricin for Namalwa cells (a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line) but that has maintained the translocation function of the B-chain and the catalytic activity of the A-chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conjugation of blocked ricin to monoclonal antibodies that bind to cell surface antigens creates new cytotoxins that approach the potency of native ricin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cytotoxins incorporate the three essential functions of natural toxins, i.e., binding to cells, transport through a membrane, and catalytic inactivation of an essential cellular process; but in addition they possess a defined cellular target specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such potent immunotoxins may play an important therapeutic role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials with an anti-CD19-blocked ricin and an anti-CD33-blocked ricin conjugate against B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> have begun </plain></SENT>
