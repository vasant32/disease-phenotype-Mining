<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proportion of proliferating cells was assessed by studying the fractional increase of cells in mitosis during a 24-hr vinblastine block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 26 cell lines tested, 17 were sensitive to IFN-alpha, and the main cell cycle effect was accumulation in the G0-G1 phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line, Namalwa, showed a decreased rate of progress through S without any G0/G1 accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the cell lines were also tested with IFN-beta and with IFN-alpha 2 produced by recombinant DNA technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter IFN did not affect one of the cell lines; otherwise, the results were similar to those of IFN-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of 16 clinical specimens from patients with hematopoietic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> were IFN-sensitive, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> displaying a G0-G1 block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that IFN sensitivity is an individually linked property unrelated to cell origin </plain></SENT>
