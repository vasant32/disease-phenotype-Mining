<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> (GCs) have been described as acting mainly as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs, they may also positively influence the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> (HC), in synergy with interleukin-15 (IL-15), induces a dramatic increase in the expansion of peripheral blood-derived CD56+ cells, favoring the preferential outgrowth of classical natural killer (CD56+CD3- NK) over CD56+CD3+ natural killer T (NKT) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HC plus IL-15-driven CD56+ cells exhibited an increased potential for cytokine production with no impairment in their NK- and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of GC-induced leucine zipper protein (GILZ) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) were detected in both NK and NKT cells cultured with HC and IL-15, in comparison to IL-15 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation status of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) was not affected by the presence of HC in either of the populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, HC differentially affected the IL-2/IL-15R beta- and gamma-chain surface expression and the phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) in IL-15-activated NK and NKT cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data ascribe a novel role to GCs on mature NK-cell expansion and function and open new perspectives for their use in cellular adoptive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
