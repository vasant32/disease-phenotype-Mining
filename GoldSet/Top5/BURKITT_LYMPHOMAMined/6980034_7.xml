<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These were compared with intracellular LD isoenzyme patterns of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid cells and were also correlated with immunologic cell surface marker characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results showed that, in general, the malignant B cells of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the lymphoblasts of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> had isoenzyme patterns similar to those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B and T cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The isoenzyme patterns of malignant lymphoid cells from patients with non-T, and non-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, cutaneous T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> were more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data, although based on small numbers of patients, are consistent with the hypothesis that LD isoenzymes may reflect differences in the maturational status of cells within a single diagnostic category </plain></SENT>
