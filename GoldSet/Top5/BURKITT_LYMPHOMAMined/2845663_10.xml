<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Besides the open reading frame encoding EBNA 1, two other open reading frames are found in the EBNA 1-specific cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first reading frame consists of several exons from BamHI W and Y <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome fragments (W1, W2, Y1, and Y2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our experiments, the W1 exon was expressed in the tryptophan-regulated expression vector pATH11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rabbit sera, raised against the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> fusion protein, recognized one or two proteins of molecular weights between 30,000 and 100,000 in several EBV genome harboring Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and EBV immortalized peripheral blood cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although, in a few cell lines from both groups no specific protein could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence analysis and characterization of subcellular distribution demonstrated that this W/Y fragment encoded latent protein is located, in part, in the cytoskeleton fraction, and in the chromatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, 2-D immunoblot analysis revealed post-translational modifications of this latent protein, probably due to phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In DNA-binding studies on DNA cellulose columns, this W/Y encoded latent protein exhibited specific DNA binding activities </plain></SENT>
