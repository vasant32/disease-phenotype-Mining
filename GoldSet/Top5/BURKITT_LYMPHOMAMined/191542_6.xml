<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of EBV-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (VCA) and early antigen (EA) was detected by indirect immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ara-A inhibited the expression of VCA in P3HR-1 cells at concentrations fivefold below those that inhibited cell multiplication; there was no concomitant accumulation of EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ara-A did not inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> of Raji cells with EBV and did not induce EA until high concentrations of the compound were reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of the expression of VCA but not EA is consistent with a postulated inhibition by ara-A of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>-directed synthesis of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At low concentrations, ara-A may exert a more specific antiviral effect than that reported for idoxuridine and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> in this system </plain></SENT>
