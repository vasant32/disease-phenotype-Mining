<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the use of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell line P3HR-1, the subcellular behavior of this antitumor antibiotic was studied by the uptake a. nd autoradiography of isolated nuclei of radioactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">NCS </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibiotic was taken up by the cells, reaching the maximum value at 1.5 hr and decreasing in value at 4.0 hr to the level at 0.5 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The silver grains in the autoradiograms were also found in the isolated nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The grain count in the nuclei showed a tendency similar to the uptake of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> by the whole cells, i.e., a gradual increase at 0.5 hr, reaching the maximum value at 1.5 hr, and then decreasing after 4.0 hr to the level at 0.5 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These facts indicated that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> reached not only to cytosol but also into the nucleus, and/or at least to the nuclear membrane of the lymphoid cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> molecules incorporated into the cells at 1.5 hr was calculated to be about 1 x 10-6/cells at a concentration of 3 mug <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> per ml of medium, which can be extrapolated to 1 x 10-4 molecules per cell at the minimum inhibitory concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of molecules should be even less within the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In cell-free systems, the interaction of DNA and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>, which is an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, was investigated with use of a Sephadex G-100 column, with negative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the cell culture system, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> molecules were degraded into smaller <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> of certain sizes by proteolysis either by serum component(s) or by cells themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An inactive isomer, pre-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>, which is an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> and a partially denatured homologous molecule, behaved similarly to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because the chemically modified <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> used in this study retained biological activity essentially similar to that of parental <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>, the results obtained here could be interpreted as similar to those of parental <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> in vitro </plain></SENT>
