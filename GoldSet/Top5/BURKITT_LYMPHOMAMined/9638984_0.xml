<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further assess myeloid differentiation and its prognostic significance in this disease, we investigated the frequency of myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene expression in the blast cells from 43 infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> registered in a Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (POG) Pilot Study for Treatment of Infant ALL, utilizing a molecular probe for detection of MPO <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) by Northern blot hybridization and a monoclonal antibody to detect MPO-protein by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sufficient <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> for Northern blot was extracted from 32 bone marrow or blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two cases, MPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was determined by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay and was negative in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MPO-specific transcripts (MPO+) were present in 19 of 34 (56%) samples analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive MPO protein was positive in 13 of the 20 (65%) patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between MPO gene expression and clinical or laboratory features, karyotypic patterns or clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of MPO gene expression demonstrated in this study suggests that leukemogenic events in many cases of infant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> appear to involve a pluripotent stem cell not yet fully committed to lymphoid differentiation </plain></SENT>
