<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a case of an 18 year old white male with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who was operated on for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and subsequently referred for evaluation of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On examination, his visual acuity (VA) was 20/20 in both eyes with a right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152176" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superior oblique palsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His pupillary reaction to light was intact while on near gaze there was no constriction of the pupils, bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other two responses of the near gaze triad ie, convergence and accommodation were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings were suggestive of an Inverse Argyll Robertson pupil (IARP), a rare entity in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We could not find a specific cause attributable to this manifestation in this patient, though we feel it may be secondary to infiltration from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and/or compression from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> of the efferent pupillary near reflex pathway </plain></SENT>
