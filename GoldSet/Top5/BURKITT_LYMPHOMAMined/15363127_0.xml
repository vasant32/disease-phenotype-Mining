<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was used to detect the CXCR4 expression by means of double-fluorescence labeling with CD19/<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> gating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that 92.9% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> patients were positively expressed CXCR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CD10, CD34 antigens were differently expressed in differentiation stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunotypes of (1) CD10(-)/CD34(+), (2) CD10(+)/CD34(+), (3) CD10(+)/CD34(-), (4) CD10(-)/CD34(-) presented at various differential stages from premature to mature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positive rate of CXCR4 were (27.60 +/- 15.25)%, (30.95 +/- 15.50)%, (55.62 +/- 18.37)% and (77.25 +/- 10.86)% from (1) to (4) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CXCR4 expression were 46.69 +/- 15.06, 47.43 +/- 12.39, 79.28 +/- 24.71 and 132.92 +/- 88.09 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CXCR4 expressions were not significantly different between the premature stages of CD10(-)/CD34(+) and CD10(+)/CD34(+) subtypes, but both were lower than the CXCR4 expression in CD10(+)/CD34(-) and CD10(-)/CD34(-) subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest incidence of CXCR4 expression was found in CD10(-)/CD34(-) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average level of CXCR4 expression on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cell with positive myeloid antigen CD13 or/and CD33 (my(+)<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) was (12.56 +/- 3.88)% of positive rate and 39.82 +/- 11.58 of MFI, both of which were less than the positive rate (37.57 +/- 11.59)% and the MFI (50.72 +/- 13.34) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cells with negative myeloid antigen expression (mye(-)<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the CXCR4 expression is associated with differentiation level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cells and down-regulated when co-expressed with myeloid antigens </plain></SENT>
