<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To test the feasibility of using the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a model for growth factor receptor action in human hematopoietic cells, we infected Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (Namalwa) with a recombinant amphotrophic retrovirus containing a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase promoter-driven human EGFR complementary DNA and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi> resistance gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">Neomycin</z:chebi>-resistant cells expressing surface EGFR were selected by cell sorting using anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody 225 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The selected cells expressed a Mr 170,000 protein immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibody 225 and apparently identical to EGFR from A431 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infected Namalwa cells expressed 42,000 epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding sites/cell, and Scatchard analysis showed two affinities (Kd approximately 5 nM and approximately 0.5 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EGFR autophosphorylation was detected using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies after 5 min exposure to EGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EGF binding induced rapid EGFR internalization (t1/2 = 9 min) and mobilization of transferrin receptors to the cell surface within 1 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In fetal bovine serum-containing and serum-free cultures, EGF did not stimulate Namalwa cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in the presence of 1.25% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO), EGF caused a dose-dependent increase in DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DMSO induced a cell cycle block in G1, which was partially reversed by EGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DMSO induced changes in some B-cell markers suggesting cellular differentiation and increased surface EGF receptor number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cells grown in DMSO and EGF were established as an EGF-dependent cell line for greater than 12 weeks, whereas cells grown in DMSO without EGF died within 1-2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Namalwa cells expressing EGFR demonstrated more rapid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in athymic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate expression of functional EGFR mediating early biochemical and growth responses in a human hematopoietic cell, and indicate that EGFR can be used as an effective model in human hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Results using DMSO are consistent with studies in other human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells indicating that agents inducing differentiation can restore growth factor dependence in previously factor-independent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
