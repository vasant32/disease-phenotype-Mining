<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several laboratories are now screening for this mutation in different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, and, recently, the mutation was described by Malanga et al in 1.9% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
