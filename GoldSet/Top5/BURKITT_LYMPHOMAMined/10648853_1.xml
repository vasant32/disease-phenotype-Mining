<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IgE antibody is, therefore, an essential reagent for studying the mechanisms of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is difficult to obtain IgE antibody in amounts sufficient for research use because IgE-producing lymphocytes are very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To overcome this problem, we investigated the requirements for generating IgE-secreting human hybridomas using in vitro immunization of peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, culture conditions were optimized for IgE production by a combination of the immunomodulatory mediators interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-6, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25433">muramyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46761">dipeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, the addition of mite antigen to the cultures resulted in an increased production of antigen-specific IgE as well as antigen-specific IgG and IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When activated lymphocytes in these cultures were fused with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, ICLU-B, antigen-specific IgE-secreting hybridomas were obtained with high efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that our culture and in vitro immunization system for human peripheral blood lymphocytes is useful for obtaining antigen-specific IgE </plain></SENT>
