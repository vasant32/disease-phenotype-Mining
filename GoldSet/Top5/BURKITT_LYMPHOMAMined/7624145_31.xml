<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Ets proteins share a conserved 85 amino acids DNA binding domain, the Ets domain and recognize various DNA target sites around a common core 5'-GGAA/T-3' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The DNA binding specificities of Spi-1 and Spi-B were investigated by using the method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated random site selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The deduced Spi-1 and Spi-B consensus binding sites are very similar suggesting that the functional activities of Spi-1 and Spi-B cannot be distinguished on the basis of their DNA binding specificities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified a putative Spi-1/Spi-B binding site in the promoter region of the c-fes/c-fps protooncogene which encodes a tyrosine kinase expressed predominantly in myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro translated Spi-1 and Spi-B proteins were capable to bind this site similarly and to activate the c-fes promoter in HeLa transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We showed that Spi-1 binds the Spi-1/Spi-B binding site of c-fes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells suggesting that Spi-1 may be involved in the regulation of c-fes transcription in myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, we detected only Spi-1 binding to this site in the Raji cell line which express both Spi-1 and Spi-B proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that Spi-1 and Spi-B exhibit different DNA binding activities in vivo although they share similar DNA binding specificities in vitro </plain></SENT>
