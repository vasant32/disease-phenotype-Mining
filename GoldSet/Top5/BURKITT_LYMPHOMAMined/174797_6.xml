<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the significance of the tubular structures and the mechanism by which they are formed remains unknown, the predilection of these structures for lymphoid and reticuloendothelial cells and their frequent association with either <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> or suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> conditions cannot be overlooked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it is possible that the tubular structures may reflect an increased production of antibody protein in response to a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigen </plain></SENT>
