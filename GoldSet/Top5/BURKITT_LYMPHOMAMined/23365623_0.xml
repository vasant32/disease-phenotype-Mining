<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A detrended fluctuation analysis (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23716">DFA</z:chebi>) method is applied to image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 2-dimensional (2D) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23716">DFA</z:chebi> algorithms is proposed for recharacterizing images of lymph sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), there is a significant different 5-year survival rates after multiagent chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, distinguishing the difference between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> is very important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, eighteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> images were classified as group A, which have one to five cytogenetic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> images were classified as group B, which have more than five cytogenetic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both groups A and B <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> are aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, which grow very fast and require more intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, ten <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> images were classified as group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The short-term correlation exponent α1 values of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23716">DFA</z:chebi> of groups A, B, and C were 0.370 ± 0.033, 0.382 ± 0.022, and 0.435 ± 0.053, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was found that α1 value of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> image was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there is no difference between the groups A and B <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hence, it can be concluded that α1 value based on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23716">DFA</z:chebi> statistics concept can clearly distinguish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> image </plain></SENT>
