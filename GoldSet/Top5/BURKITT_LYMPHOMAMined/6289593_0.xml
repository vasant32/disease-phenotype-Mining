<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unicircular complex forms were apparently absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cell types studied, suggesting that these forms are not a common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No clear correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> modifications--as detected by stereological analysis--and the presence of catenated forms could be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that other mechanisms rather than replication of mt DNA would appear to be the mechanism responsible for the formation of these forms </plain></SENT>
