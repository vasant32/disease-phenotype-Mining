<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Rho GTPase may be involved in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> invasion via the augmentation of cell motility and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on two point mutations of the D4-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (GDP)-dissociation inhibitor (GDI) gene, one of the Rho-GDIs, which were found in a human leukemic cell line, Reh, and the mutated D4-GDI functions as an accelerator of leukemic cell invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated the altered activity of GDP dissociation by mutated (mt) D4-GDI and the functions of this mt and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (wt) D4-GDI in invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mice inoculated with wt or mt D4-GDI vector-transfected Raji cells were observed and examined pathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adhesiveness and cell motility of wt or mt D4-GDI vector-transfected Raji cells were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, it was examined whether Rho activation was changed by mutation of D4-GDI under the condition of Rho-GDI knockdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two point mutations of the D4-GDI gene were found in Reh cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The region of mutations is conserved among members of the Rho-GDI family at the amino acid level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>D4-GDI with two mutations (V68L and V69A) functioned in a dominant negative manner in the inhibition of GDP dissociation from Rho </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severe combined immune-deficient mice inoculated with Raji cells developed hemiparalysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Raji cells were present in bone marrow and peripheral blood, and hepatic invasion was observed in 20% of the mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mice inoculated with wt D4-GDI vector-transfected Raji cells (wt D4) showed later <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> and none developed hepatic invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mice inoculated with mt D4-GDI-transfected Raji cells (mt D4) showed a 5-day reduction in the time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, hepatic invasion was evident in 80% of mice transplanted with mt D4 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in growth rates and amounts of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>)-bound Rho, cdc42, or Rac among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clones, however, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-bound Rho in mt D4 clone with short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (shRNA) vector for Rho-GDI knockdown was increased compared with wt D4 clone with shRNA vector for Rho-GDI knockdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The mt D4 cells showed an augmentation of adhesiveness and cell motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, wt D4 cells showed a decreased ability of cell motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest the mutated D4-GDI functions as a dominant negative molecule against the wt D4-GDI and accelerates invasion via regulation of cytoskeletal machinery </plain></SENT>
