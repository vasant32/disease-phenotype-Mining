<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess whether oral <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> can eliminate persistent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and thereby prevent EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> development in HIV-seropositive homosexual men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> was examined in a group of 21 HIV-seropositive homosexual men before, during and after treatment with oral <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> at a dose of 800 mg every 6 h (10 individuals) or with a placebo (11 individuals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 13 individuals, EBV was isolated from the oropharynx before and after treatment (seven cases from the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi>-treated group and six from the placebo-treated group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in virus isolation occurred during treatment in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi>-treated group, but not in the placebo-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In seven cases in whom EBV shedding was detected before and after treatment, the EBV strain isolated was identical throughout the study, even when <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> had abolished detectable shedding for the duration of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two other cases more than one strain was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On examination of the EBV type present, 89% of a group of 18 patients consistently shed type A virus, 5.5% type B virus and 5.5% showed evidence of co-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with both virus types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This compares with figures of 100, 0 and 0%, respectively, in a control group of HIV-seronegative individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-dose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> therapy does not eliminate persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> from the oropharynx of healthy HIV-seropositive individuals and therefore would not necessarily prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by type B EBV, and co-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> of both A and B type, are more common in HIV-seropositives than HIV-seronegatives </plain></SENT>
