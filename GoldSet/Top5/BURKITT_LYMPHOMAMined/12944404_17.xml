<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown that both anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb and VT-1 induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the apoptotic pathways induced by these two molecules by selecting cell lines sensitive to only one of these inducers or to both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these cell lines (including the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-resistant line), VT-1 was transported to the endoplasmic reticulum and inhibited protein synthesis similarly, suggesting that VT-1-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is dissociated from these processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VT-1 triggered a caspase- and mitochondria-dependent pathway (rapid activation of caspases 8 and 3 associated with a loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential (Deltapsim) and the release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> from mitochondria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb-induced pathway was caspase-independent and only involved partial depolarization of mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">Antioxidant</z:chebi> compounds had only marginal effects on VT-1-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> but strongly protected cells from anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VT-1- and anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb-treated cells displayed very different features on electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results clearly indicate that the binding of different ligands to Gb3/CD77 triggers completely different apoptotic pathways </plain></SENT>
