<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the Jijoye-P3HR-1 family of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> sublines, the expression of the B lymphoblast-1 antigen, BB-1, identified by the monoclonal antibody described by Yokochi and colleagues, was found to be strictly related to the expression of the EBV receptor/C3 receptor (EBVR/C3R) complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was absent on the receptor-negative P3HR-1 line, present in the original receptor-positive Jijoye line, and reappeared in nonvirus producer sublines derived from P3HR-1 itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We suggest the BB-1 antigen is related to the EBVR/C3R complex in the Jijoye family, either at the level of genetic or epigenetic determination or at the level of steric interaction on the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> probability, however, the BB-1 antigen is not identical to the receptor itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is also clear that a similar relationship does not necessarily apply to other cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the course of the studies, it was accidentally discovered that propagation of the P3HR-1 cells on newborn instead of fetal calf serum induces the concomitant expression of EBV receptors, C3 receptors, and the BB-1 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of this induction is obscure; it does not appear to be related to any significant change in the frequency of virus-producing cells </plain></SENT>
