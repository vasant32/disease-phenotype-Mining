<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 41 patients successfully analyzed showed clonal chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 25 of the 41 (61%), the defects were found to be consistent with (A) a deletion 6q in five of seven patients with diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, (B) a t(11;14), a del 11q, or a + 12 in seven of nine patients with small cell lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and (C) a t(14;18) in 12 of 15 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (small cleaved and mixed small and large cleaved) and in a single case of diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In three patients with small cell lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> whose biopsies exhibited a t(11;14), lymphocytes were cultured and chromosomes examined for the presence of fragile sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two, frequent breaks at band 11q13.3 were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such findings suggest a possible relationship between a fragile site and a predisposition to a specific chromosomal rearrangement in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
