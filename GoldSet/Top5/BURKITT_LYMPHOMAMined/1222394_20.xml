<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevation above 2 SDS of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean were found in varying number of patients in each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For those <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> studied that involved more than 20 patients, the greatest incidences of increased excretion were 66% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> in patients with colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and 50% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16610">spermidine</z:chebi> in patients with bronchogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The highest levels and greatest frequency of elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> levels were found in patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and changes in clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> status associated with treatment appeared to correlate well with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> levels in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormal amounts of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi> were also excreted by some patients with diseases other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, indicating that increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> excretion is not restricted or specific to the neoplastic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was also found that the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi> were apparently not affected by the intake of meat or the diet eaten, and remained in a rather narrow excretion range for any one individual at different time intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study was carried out as part of a program to determine and evaluate biologic materials present in body fluids that may be used to follow and evaluate response or progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic disease</z:e> in patients during treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that abnormal urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> levels may be characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic growth</z:e> for some patients with malignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to determine if these compounds may be helpful in assessing disease status for patients with such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> as colon and bronchogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> although their potential as useful "biologic markers" appears less promising than originally anticipated </plain></SENT>
