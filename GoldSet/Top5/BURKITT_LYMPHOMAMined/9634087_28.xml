<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A body cavity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell line (BC1), known to carry both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e> virus type 8 (HHV-8; or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo>-associated herpesvirus, KSHV), was analysed for the expression of EBV-encoded, growth transformation-associated antigens and <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> by immunofluorescence staining, Western blotting, RT-PCR and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A similar phenotypic analysis was also performed on another body cavity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line, BCBL1, that is singly infected with HHV-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phenotypically, the two lines were closely similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although both lines are known to carry rearranged immunoglobulin genes, they were mostly negative for B-cell surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both expressed the HHV-8-encoded nuclear antigen (LNA1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly to Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen type 1 (EBNA1), LNA1 was associated with the chromatin in interphase nuclei and the mitotic chromosomes in metaphase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It accumulated in a few well-circumscribed nuclear bodies that did not co-localize with EBNA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BC1 cells expressed EBNA1, LMP2A and EBV-encoded small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> but not EBNA2-6, LMP1 and LMP2B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were thus similar to type I Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and latently infected peripheral B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the splicing pattern of the EBNA1-encoding message by RT-PCR showed that BC1 cells used the QUK but not the YUK splice, indicating that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was initiated from Qp and not from Cp or Wp </plain></SENT>
