<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase enzyme activity from the cell lysates was purified from an affinity column which contained bound single-stranded oligodeoxycytidylic acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deficient enzyme activity in certain elution fractions from the siRNA-transfected cells was restored by including recombinant <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> 70 in the assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enzyme activity in some other fractions was increased after siRNA transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activation-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase (AID) is a central factor in the immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A more specific assay for AID was used to study the influence of Hsp70 on AID activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike Hsp70's ability to stimulate certain enzymes of DNA base excision repair and other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminases, it had little effect on AID activity in vitro, or was weakly inhibitory </plain></SENT>
