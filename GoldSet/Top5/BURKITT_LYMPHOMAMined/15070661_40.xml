<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the migration and in vivo homing to the bone marrow of nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice injected with human precursor-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cells in comparison to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34+ progenitors (both cord blood and mobilized peripheral blood) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although migration and homing of both cell populations was dependent on stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)/CXCR4 interactions, major differences in receptor expression as well as the migratory capacity toward various concentrations of SDF-1 were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, unlike <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34+ progenitors, in vivo homing of the leukemic cells was superior when recipient <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice were not irradiated prior to transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we report differences in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules activated following SDF-1 stimulation, documenting a major role for very late antigen 4 (VLA-4), but not VLA-5 and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), in homing of precursor-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B ALL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Toxin-B and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pertussis</z:e> toxin inhibited the homing of the leukemic cells but not that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34+ progenitors or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD10+/CD19+ precursor-B cells, revealing differences in CXCR4 signaling pathways that are based on changes that acquired by the leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altogether, our data provide new insights into different SDF-1-induced signaling, activation, and consequent motility between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34+ and precursor-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B ALL</z:e> progenitors, which may lead to improved clinical protocols </plain></SENT>
