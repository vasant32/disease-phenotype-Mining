<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, 2 weeks after diagnosis her leucocyte count rose rapidly with a predominance of myeloid blasts with M5b <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and CD19+ myeloid immunophenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) treatment was started and remission was achieved after one course of chemotherapy; the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> treatment was continued for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two months after cessation of chemotherapy, the patient developed a bone marrow relapse, this time with an undifferentiated blast <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and a precursor B immunophenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes showed several clonal gene rearrangements at diagnosis: two IGH, two IGK and two TCRD gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rearrangements were also detected during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> phase of the disease, suggesting a phenotypic shift of the same <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At relapse, 8 months later, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rearrangements were preserved except for one TCRD (Vdelta2-Ddelta3) rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The first phenotypic shift in the genotypically stable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> was remarkably fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most probable explanation for our observations is an oncogenic event in an undifferentiated haematopoietic progenitor clone, with a highly versatile phenotype </plain></SENT>
