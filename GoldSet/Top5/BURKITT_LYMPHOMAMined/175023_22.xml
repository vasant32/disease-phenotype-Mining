<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, cord-blood lymphocytes transformed by African EBV strains contained 0.2-0.3% of cells with EBV capsid and early antigen and produced EBV with transforming activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cells contained twice as many copies of EBV homologous DNA as the cells transformed by American EBV strains </plain></SENT>
