<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is characterized by a translocation of the c-myc gene with one of the immunoglobulin loci which activates overexpression of the c-myc oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antisense-oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODNs) offer the potential to block specific c-myc gene expression within <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, but often exhibit a low efficiency of AS-ODN uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, a polycationic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> reagent, Lipofectamine (LFM), was utilized as a vehicle to increase efficiency of delivery, decrease the time needed to observe an inhibitory effect, and decrease the AS-ODN dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective was to develop a more efficient and rapid in vitro AS-ODN strategy to inhibit proliferation of c-myc-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and to test the specificity of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line-directed AS-ODNs for potential use as molecular purging agents in bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proliferation assays were performed to determine the inhibitory effect of the AS-ODNs on two Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines with different chromosomal translocations, Daudi and ST486, in medium containing 8.5 microM LFM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AS-ODNs at a concentration of 0.36 microM induced a significant decrease in proliferation for both cell lines using the specific AS-ODN for each respective translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within 5 h, Daudi responded to its specific AS-ODN/<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> complexes with a 35% decrease in proliferation, compared to cells which received no treatment or Daudi-specific AS-ODN without LFM (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Daudi showed an insignificant decrease in proliferation when treated with an AS-ODN specific for the ST486 translocation (4%, P = 0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ST486 proliferation was decreased by 52% when treated with the specific antisense for ST486 compared to no treatment or ST486-specific AS-ODN without LFM (P &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the AS-ODN specific for Daudi showed an insignificant 4% decrease (P = 0.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Controls, including sense ODN for structure, reverse AS-ODN for structure and base composition, and AS-ODN without LFM, did not produce a significant change in cells treated with LFM alone or cells receiving no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clonogenic assays of both Daudi and ST486 treated with their specific AS-ODNs revealed a 50% inhibition of colony formation after the 5 h incubation as compared to no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Confocal laser scanning microscopy verified that cellular uptake of AS-ODN was enhanced by cationic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis showed a 63 +/- 5% and a 50 +/- 3% reduction in intracellular c-myc levels for Daudi and ST486, respectively, when their respective AS-ODNs were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> bone marrow progenitors were unaffected by the ODN/LFM complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the specific c-myc AS-ODN/LFM complexes inhibit c-myc-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> proliferation at an earlier time and at a lower dose compared to no <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> facilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This approach may form the basis for utilizing specific AS-ODN/LFM therapy either alone or in a cocktail of other agents as an ex vivo molecular purging approach to autologous stem cell transplantation in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
