<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The typical 12; 15 translocation leads to the juxtaposition of c-myc and immunoglobulin heavy-chain sequences, whereas the 6; 15 translocation links the kappa light-chain locus with the pvt-1 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> variant translocation) locus, located at least 75kb 3' of c-myc [Cory, S., Graham, M., Webb, E., Corcoran, L. &amp; Adams, J </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike the human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated translocation, the lambda/myc juxtaposed variant translocation has not been found previously in MPCs </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To explore whether the 15; 16 translocation represents the lambda/myc juxtaposition, we have mapped the breakpoints on chromosomes 15 and 16 by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pvt-1 region was mapped to approximately 220 kb 3' of c-myc </plain></SENT>
