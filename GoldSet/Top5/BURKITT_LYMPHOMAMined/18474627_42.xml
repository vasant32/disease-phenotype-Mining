<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As uncontrolled expression of AID is potentially mutagenic, different types of regulation, particularly nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, restrict the likelihood of AID-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> encounters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied additional mechanisms of regulation affecting the stability of the AID protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No modulation of protein accumulation according to the cell cycle was observed in a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the half-life of AID was markedly reduced in the nucleus, and this destabilization was accompanied by a polyubiquitination that was revealed in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same compartment-specific degradation was observed in activated mouse B cells, and also in a non-B cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No specific lysine residues could be linked to this degradation, so it remains unclear whether polyubiquitination proceeds through several alternatives sites or through the protein N terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nuclear-restricted form of AID displayed enhanced mutagenicity at both Ig and non-Ig loci, most notably at TP53, suggesting that modulation of nuclear AID content through proteasomal degradation may represent another level of control of AID activity </plain></SENT>
