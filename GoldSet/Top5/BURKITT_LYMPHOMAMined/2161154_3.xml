<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major immunoreactive EBNA 1 proteins migrated as two doublets with molecular masses of about 39/41 and 49/51 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gel mobility shift experiments showed that these products exhibit the sequence-specific DNA binding on ori P previously characterized for a 28-kDa lambda N-fusion protein encompassing the carboxy third of the EBNA 1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three monoclonal antibodies previously found to react with EBNA 1 were shown to block binding of DNA by the EBNA 1 products expressed in bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same monoclonal antibodies also blocked specific DNA binding by EBNA 1 produced in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells infected by EB virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fab fragments of two monoclonal antibodies inhibited DNA binding by EBNA 1, indicating that the antibodies recognize an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of the protein that is involved in the recognition of DNA, or another domain crucial for DNA binding such as a dimerization site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human antisera with antibody to EBNA 1 neutralized specific binding of EBNA 1 to DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings will help to map the residues of the EBNA 1 protein which are essential for specific binding of DNA </plain></SENT>
