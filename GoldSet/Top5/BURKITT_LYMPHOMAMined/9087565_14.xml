<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The B-cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cell line SUP-B2 has a t(6;12)(q23;p13) involving ETV6 at 12p13 and a submicroscopic deletion of the other ETV6 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reciprocal translocation results in the fusion of ETV6 to a previously unknown gene at 6q23, which we named STL (six-twelve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> gene) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both reciprocal fusion transcripts can be detected: On the der(6) chromosome, the ETV6/STL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> shows an apparently out of frame fusion of ETV6 at nucleotide 187 to STL, which would result in the addition of 14 amino acids to the first 54 amino acids of ETV6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the der(12) chromosome three different variants of the STL/ETV6 fusion <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> could be detected; variable size segments were inserted at the breakpoint between STL and ETV6 exon 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of these variants could give rise to a protein in which the first 54 amino acids of ETV6 are replaced by 12 amino acids from one of the STL short open reading frames </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of a 1.4 kb STL cDNA clone from a skeletal muscle library revealed no long open reading frames </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This cell line will be very useful in studying the different mechanisms by which alterations of ETV6 contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> and in testing the hypothesis that ETV6 might act as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene </plain></SENT>
