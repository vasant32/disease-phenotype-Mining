<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Though Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been linked to classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (cHD), only a proportion of cHD cases show EBV-association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While there has been evidence to suggest a crucial role for EBV in the early phase of cHD evolution, we are unclear whether continued presence of EBV is essential for the maintenance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have addressed this issue by investigating the EBV-association in paired samples of cHD obtained at presentation and relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have analysed lymph node biopsy samples from 23 cases of cHD at presentation and relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization with EBER-1 probe and immunostaining with anti latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) antibody was performed on the paraffin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR for EBNA 3C gene was performed for EBV subtype analysis on the DNA extracted from paraffin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EBV-association was documented in both the presentation and relapse samples of 14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One case showed loss of EBV-association at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PCR analysable DNA was obtained from both presentation and relapse samples in four of the EBV-associated cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The EBNA 3C amplimer corresponded to type A strain of EBV in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Loss of EBV-association between presentation and relapse seen in one case implies a hit and run mechanism in EBV-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Though EBV may be essential early in the evolution of cHD, it may not be required for maintenance of the neoplastic clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our study also brings out a speculation that a proportion of EBV-negative cHD could represent loss of EBV in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> prior to clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, an unidentified lymphotropic virus other than EBV might play a pathogenetic role in EBV-negative cHD </plain></SENT>
