<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with a growing number of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> underlines the importance of efforts aimed at preventing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with this potential carcinogen and of establishing animal models for human virus-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cottontop tamarins have been used in EBV vaccine studies because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> regularly induces <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> similar to those seen in human immunocompromised individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In recent years, several vaccines based on the gp340/220 envelope protein of EBV have been developed and shown to prevent the development of EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using in situ hybridization and immunohistology, we have characterized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in one nonimmunized and three immunized animals after challenge with a standard tumorigenic dose of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the nonimmunized animal, EBV-infected lymphoid cells were detected in numerous tissues showing no obvious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, variable numbers of virus-carrying cells were also found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three immunized animals that were protected against the development of virus-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This observation demonstrates that vaccination does not induce sterilizing immunity against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Double labeling suggested a B <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> of the majority of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> of nonlymphoid cells was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene expression in immunized animals suggested a restricted form of virus latency different from that seen in EBV-driven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in nonimmunized cottontop tamarins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results raise the possibility that immunized cottontop tamarins protected against the development of EBV-driven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or animals exposed to a sublymphomagenic dose of virus may serve as a model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
