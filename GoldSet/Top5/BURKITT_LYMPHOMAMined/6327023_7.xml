<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study of retroviruses now has direct relevance to the understanding of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This came about through direct demonstration of retroviruses as etiological agents in certain human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and through the discovery of a set of cellular genes (onc genes) that may play important roles in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal cell growth by their association with certain animal retroviruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cellular onc genes are a group of evolutionarily conserved sequences which are homologous to the transforming genes (v-onc) of oncogenic retroviruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although their functions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells are largely not known, the sequence homology between cellular onc genes and the transforming v-onc genes is consistent with the idea that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> may, in some cases, be due to abnormal expression of these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have approached this problem by molecular cloning of the human c-onc genes, using these as probes to examine the levels of expression and possible modification of these genes in different neoplastic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, and by determining their precise locations on the human chromosomes to correlate with known chromosomal alterations in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Through these studies, we provided evidence for gene amplification and chromosomal translocation as two mechanisms for c-onc activation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and implicated the c-myc gene in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus is a family of related T-lymphotropic viruses isolated from humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first and thus far the only exogenous human retrovirus identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of this family, human T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus I, is etiologically associated with a distinct subtype of mature T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> called adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association is borne out by extensive seroepidemiology which revealed several regions of the world, including Southwestern Japan, the Caribbean Islands, and Africa, to be endemic; by demonstration of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> sequences clonally integrated in the adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells; and, more remarkably, by the capacity of the virus to transform <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human T-cells in culture and in effect reproduce in vitro some of the in vivo leukemogenic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other subgroups that are distantly related to human T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus I have been obtained from a patient with T-cell hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The full disease spectrum of these viruses remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
