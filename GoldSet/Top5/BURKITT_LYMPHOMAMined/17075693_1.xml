<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When delivered to cells, they may disrupt protein-protein interactions, thereby influencing intracellular signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We showed earlier that phosphopeptides corresponding to the inhibitory motif of Fcgamma receptor IIb and a motif of the Grb2-associated binder 1 adaptor protein activate SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study the ex vivo effects of these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, we have now compared different methods for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> delivery: (i) permeabilization of the target cells and (ii) the use of cell-permeable vectors, which are potentially able to transport biologically active compounds into B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25650">octanoyl</z:chebi>-Arg(8) to be an optimal carrier for the delivery of phosphopeptides to the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With this strategy, the function of cell-permeable SHP-2-binding phosphopeptides was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> modulated the protein phosphorylation in B cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
