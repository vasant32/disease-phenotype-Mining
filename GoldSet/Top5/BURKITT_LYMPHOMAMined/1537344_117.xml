<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Telomere attachment is observed in several cell types and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of interphase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mapping experiments show that telomeres are anchored via their TTAGGG repeats; a subtelomeric repeat located immediately proximal to the telomeric TTAGGG repeats is quantitatively released from the nuclear matrix by restriction endonuclease cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TTAGGG repeats introduced at chromosome-internal sites by DNA transfection do not behave as matrix attached loci, suggesting that the telomeric position of the repeats is required for their interaction with the nuclear matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with the idea that telomeres function as a nucleoprotein complex </plain></SENT>
