<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To examine the biochemical structure of the antigen recognized by the monoclonal pan-B cell antibody, Y29/55, the Daudi- and Jurkat-cell lines were labeled by two different methods and immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After surface labeling with <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>, two bands with molecular weights of about 38 and 42 kD were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same two proteins were precipitated after biosynthetic labeling with (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>)-methionine from B cells and, to a lesser extent, from T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it seems that the same proteins, or proteins with similar molecular weight, exist intracellularly in T cells as exist on the surface of, and possibly intracellularly, in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was confirmed that 80-90% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood-derived B cells were stained with Y29/55 by indirect immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double-labeling experiments with the pan-B cell antibodies Leu 16 (CD 20) and Leu 12 (CD 19) showed a B-cell population which could be stained with both antibodies (Y29/55 and Leu 16 or Y29/55 and Leu 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A minor cell population was stained with the antibody Y29/55 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that the antibody Y29/55 recognizes a B-cell antigen, which has not been described previously </plain></SENT>
