<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>2-N,N-Diethylaminocarbonyloxymethyl-1-diphenylmethyl-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28568">piperazine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="53396,53430,8055">PMS</z:chebi>-1077) is a trisubstituted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28568">piperazine</z:chebi> which contains a trimethoxybenzene ring and a benzhydrylpiperazine fragment, both of which can induce cell proliferation regression by different mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have therefore examined the effects of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="53396,53430,8055">PMS</z:chebi>-1077 on Human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (Raji) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The viability of Raji cells was determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay and also assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="37" ids="53396,53430,8055">PMS</z:chebi>-1077 can suppress the proliferation of Raji cells in a dose- and timedependent manner, while inhibit colony formation ability of Raji cells merely in a dose-dependent manner in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, morphological changes were observed using fluorescence microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis through PI stains showed that <z:chebi fb="37" ids="53396,53430,8055">PMS</z:chebi>-1077 blocked the growth of Raji cells in the G(0)/G(1) period, and induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Raji cells after 48 h of incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by <z:chebi fb="37" ids="53396,53430,8055">PMS</z:chebi>-1077 was further confirmed by staining with Annexin-V <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> and PI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preliminary study by molecular docking suggests that <z:chebi fb="37" ids="53396,53430,8055">PMS</z:chebi>-1077 may inhibit tubulin polymerization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More experiments are in progress in our laboratory to reveal the mode of action of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="53396,53430,8055">PMS</z:chebi>-1077 in the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Raji cells </plain></SENT>
