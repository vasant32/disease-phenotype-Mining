<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An approach to obtain monoclonal antibodies directed against cell surface proteins induced by interferon has been developed in order to characterize such proteins and determine their role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hybridomas obtained by fusion of murine <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells and spleen cells of mice immunized with interferon-alpha-treated Daudi cells were screened for the production of antibodies reacting differentially with interferon-alpha-treated and untreated Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One such hybridoma, 2D5, produced an antibody reacting with a 28/32 kDa homodimeric protein (p28/32) expressed at the surface of Daudi cells in response to IFN-alpha treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IFN-alpha treatment also increased the basal level of p28/32 detected on peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2D5 Antibody was used to probe the expression of p28/32 on different cells and in response to various inducers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It appears that 2D5 reacted in fact with CD69, a marker of leukocyte activation and that, following IFN-alpha treatment, CD69 was not induced on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cultured cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, IFN-gamma was also able to induce CD69 expression on a restricted number of cell lines but the induction pattern only partially overlapped that of IFN-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As expected, activation of cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) resulted in a notable increase in the level of CD69 on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines considered except for the epithelial and fibroblastic types </plain></SENT>
