<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective study based on 107 B-CLL patients, the expression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules CD44, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD18, CD25 and CD54 was analysed in bone marrow cryostat sections by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD44 expression clearly identified two subgroups of B-CLL patients with different clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, CD44-positive patients presented with advanced disease, more often displayed a diffuse pattern of bone marrow infiltration, and had a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>33/61 patients positive for CD44 died within the observation period compared to 7/46 patients negative for CD44 (P = 0.0012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis emphasized the independent prognostic value of CD44 expression for overall survival (P = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients positive for CD11c showed a longer survival, with 9/40 patients dying within the observation period compared to 31/67 negative for CD11c (P = 0.0013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients lacking CD11c were in advanced Rai and Binet stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed CD11c as a relevant independent prognostic marker (P = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CD11c was able to separate patients with significantly different prognosis in the subgroup of CD44-positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>4/18 patients positive for CD44 and CD11c died before median survival time was reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients positive for CD44 but negative for CD11c had an adverse prognosis: 29/43 patients died, median survival time was 33.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that CD44 positivity and CD11c negativity are associated with more advanced disease and worse prognosis in B-CLL and suggest CD44-positive/CD11c-negative cases represent a more aggressive form of the disease </plain></SENT>
