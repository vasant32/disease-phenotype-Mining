<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) plays a significant role as a cofactor in the process of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and has consistently been associated with a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (EBER1 and EBER2) are the most abundant <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> transcripts in latently EBV-infected cells and their role in <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues of surgically removed <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> biopsies are widely available form but have never been exploited for expressional studies previously in Pakistan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) in FFPE biopsy tissues remains the gold standard for proving EBV relationship in a histopathological lesion but their reagents associated limitations confines their reliability in some applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently introduced targeted drug delivery systems induce <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> lytic gene expression and therefore require more sensitive method to quantify <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> as well as cellular gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight (8) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples were screened to detect the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Qualitative and quantitative expression of EBV Encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (EBER1, EBER2) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (interleukin-10) in FFPE EBV positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue samples were then analysed by using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this study we have successfully quantified elevated expressional levels of both cellular and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> transcripts, namely EBER1, EBER2 and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) in the FFPE Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) specimens of Pakistani origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that FFPE samples may retain <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> as well as cellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression information at detectable level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is first study which represents elevated expressional levels of EBER1, EBER2 and IL-10 in FFPE tissue samples of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Pakistan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations will potentially improve current lacunas in clinical as well as diagnostic practices in Pakistan and can be further exploited to develop new strategies for studying cellular and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene expression </plain></SENT>
