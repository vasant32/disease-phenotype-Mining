<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes two anti-apoptotic cellular Bcl2 homologs, BALF1 and BHRF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BHRF1 has an anti-apoptotic activity but is rarely expressed in nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, BALF1 is not yet well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to characterize BALF1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, the search of its transcriptional expression in EBV-positive B cell lines, EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>'s cell lines and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>'s biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, the examination of its anti-apoptotic activity in serum dependent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: We first analysed the transcriptional expression of BALF1 by reverse transcriptase DNA polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the analysis of its anti-apoptotic activity, we transfected NIH3T3 cells with pBABE-BALF1 expression plasmid and studied serum dependence of these transfectants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BALF1 expression was detected in the latent stage and increased more significantly during the lytic phase in IgG-treated AKATA and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-SB-treated P3HR1-TK negative cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As its expression was not affected by the inhibitor of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA synthesis, this gene does not belong to late gene family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When analysed its transcription in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>)-derived cell lines and NPC biopsies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-derived cell lines and more than 80% of NPC biopsies transcribed this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study of serum dependence of BALF1-transfected NIH3T3 cells showed: with 10% of serum, BALF1 transfectants grew significantly more higher cell density than vector alone transfected NIH3T3 cell lines and with 1% of serum, BALF1 transfectants were capable of growing, but with about 40% reduced rate in comparison with those with 10% serum, while vector alone transfected NIH3T3 cells could not almost grow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BALF1 gene was transcribed in EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>BALF1 could render cells to serum independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that BALF1 gene could play its role in EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
