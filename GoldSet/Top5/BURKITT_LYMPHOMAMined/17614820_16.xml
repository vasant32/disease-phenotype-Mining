<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulation of beta-catenin was measured by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of B-cell progenitor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) cells revealed expression of Wnt genes, including WNT2B in 33%, WNT5A in 42%, WNT10B in 58% and WNT16B in 25% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Wnt receptors, (Frizzled) FZD7 and FZD8 were also expressed in most cases while FZD3, FZD4 and FZD9 were occasionally detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of ALL cells with Wnt-3a activated canonical Wnt signalling with increased expression and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This resulted in a 1.7- to 5.3-fold increase in cell proliferation, which was associated with enhanced cell cycle entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in the survival of ALL cells under conditions of serum deprivation was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR revealed that activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway led to altered expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and leukaemic B-cell progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that Wnt-3a provides proliferative and survival cues in ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This data suggests that targeting the Wnt signalling pathway may be a useful therapeutic strategy in ALL </plain></SENT>
