<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been maintained for the past two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells were small and round, and grew in a suspension culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Population doubling time was approximately 36 hours, The cells revealed the chromosomal abnormality i.e. translocation between 8 and 14 chromosomes, which was reported on some Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This line was negative for nuclear antigen of EB virus (EBNA) and bore surface IgA and not any receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inoculums of 10(7) cells produced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in the athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histological appearance of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was consistent with the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural findings showed nuclear <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>blebs</z:mp> and clefts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As far as we know, this was the first cell line of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with t(8q-; 14q+) in Japan and perhaps the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line with surface IgA </plain></SENT>
