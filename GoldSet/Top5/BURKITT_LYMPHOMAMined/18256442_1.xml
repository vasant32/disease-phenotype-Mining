<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These co-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, however, are insufficient to explain the non-random occurrence of Endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> within Equatorial Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore whether this distribution could be explained by household characteristics and family environment, we conducted a case-control study using 41 hospitalized incident endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases and 91 healthy controls identified through a population-based multistage cluster-sampling scheme in Nyanza Province, Kenya </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, odds ratios associated with having one, two, and three or more younger siblings compared with none were 0.28 (90% CI: 0.09, 0.83), 0.59 (90% CI: 0.16, 2.23) and 0.15 (90% CI: 0.03, 0.67) respectively, suggesting that children with endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were more likely than controls to be last-born </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children with endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were also more likely to live in non-monogamous families (OR=3.12, 90% CI:1.19, 8.17) and to have at least one deceased parent (OR=3.38, 90% CI: 1.18, 9.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Household characteristics, especially sibship relationships, may contribute to endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and therefore warrant further study </plain></SENT>
