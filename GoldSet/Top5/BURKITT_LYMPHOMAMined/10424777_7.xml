<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The implications of telomerase on senescence and human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> are widely accepted, but the changes of telomerase activity along with cell cycle modulation by anticancer treatment still remain obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we issued whether the telomerase activity fluctuated along with cell cycle of cultured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells using the antiproliferative effect of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Daudi Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, treated with IFN-alpha, showed proliferation inhibition and cell cycle arrest at G1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The telomerase activity at 72 h was repressed to about 20% of control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, after 72 h IFN-alpha treatment, the cells in G1 phase showed the marked decrease of telomerase activity, while cells in S and G2/M still possessed it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among expressions of telomerase-related genes, only the catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT) decreased from 48 h, while the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33699">template RNA</z:chebi> component (hTERC) and telomerase-associated protein 1 (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="45927">TEP</z:chebi>-1) were not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The downregulation of c-Myc preceded the change of hTERT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the analysis of cells treated with IFN-alpha for 24 h revealed that cells in G1-to-S transition mainly expressed high hTERT, while S and G2/M cells had higher level of telomerase activity than that of G1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that (i) the expression of hTERT precedes the telomerase activity which is higher in S and G2/M phases than G1 phase, (ii) IFN-alpha repressed the telomerase activity in a cell cycle-dependent manner with the downregulation of hTERT </plain></SENT>
