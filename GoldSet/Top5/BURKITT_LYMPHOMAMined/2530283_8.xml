<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two species, Fc epsilon RIIa and Fc epsilon RIIb, of the human low-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RII/CD23) have recently been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They differ by only six amino acids in the cytoplasmic N-terminus and are generated by different cell-specific transcriptional start sites that lead to distinct 5'-leader sequences in the corresponding <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we present the analysis of the promoter which is regulating the expression of the B cell-specific Fc epsilon RIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data show that this promoter is flanked by several long repetitive elements that are influencing transcription in the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cell line Jijoye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial deletions of the 5'-flanking region of the promoter revealed two major regulatory segments that have either inhibitory or enhancing effects on transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, IL-4 caused a two- to four-fold up-regulation of the Fc epsilon RIIa promoter activity and the DNA element responsible was mapped within the first 250 bp of the 5'-flanking region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed by transferring the DNA segment containing the putative IL-4 responsive element to a heterologous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that IL-4 augments the Fc epsilon RIIa expression by transcriptional regulation </plain></SENT>
