<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show here that cytotoxic T lymphocytes of the Vgamma9/Vdelta2 subset, but not of the Vdelta1 subset of human gammadelta T cells, express natural killer inhibitory receptors (KIR) with specificity for different HLA class I alleles that down-regulate TCR-mediated signaling in response to HLA class I-expressing B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cell clones with a T helper <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> lack KIR and produce lymphokines in response to most human B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, just as they do upon recognition of the HLA class I-deficient human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, human Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells have an innate specificity for nonpolymorphic cell surface structures expressed by many <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and their cytotoxic activity is controlled by KIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results imply a general role of human Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells in the defense against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumors</z:e> that is distinct from NK cells </plain></SENT>
