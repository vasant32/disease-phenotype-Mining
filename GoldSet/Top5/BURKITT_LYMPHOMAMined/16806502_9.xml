<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BaMHIW fragments of the EBV genome and DNA sequences of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latent membrane protein (LMP)1 and LMP2 genes were detected in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BaMHI-digested high-molecular weight DNA from Raji cells generated 4 and 10 kb, 23 kb fragments that hybridized to Probe-1 (EBV genome 13232-16189) and Probe-2 (EBV genome 5-3271) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic library for Raji cells was constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plaques (1 x 10(5)) were screened with Probe-2, and four positive clones were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal integration of EBV DNA was detected in the Raji cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> integration sites included 1p, 1q, 2q, 3p, 3q, 4q, 5q, 6q, 7p, 7q, 9q, 11p, 14q and 15q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite this multiplicity of integration sites, integration showed high frequency only at the sites 4q, 2q, 1q and 7q; 64% of the total signals were found in these four chromosomal bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> integration occurred in chromosomes 16-22 or the sex chromosomes (X, Y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study is the first comprehensive FISH analysis of EBV integration into the chromosomes of the Raji cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings support the notion that EBV integrates into the Raji cell genome non-randomly </plain></SENT>
