<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present work studies the effect of those interferons upon cell lines which do not express class I antigen on their membrane: K 562 et Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If beta 2m <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is enhanced in K 562 cell by both alpha and beta interferons, those interferons are not able to promote the de novo synthesis of HLA-A, B, c <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, which is not detectable in this cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, HLA-A, B, C <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, which is present in Daudi cell, is amplified by both alpha and beta interferons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we could show that, if it has not been possible to detect mature beta 2m protein either in the cytoplasm or on Daudi membrane, there is a poly A+ <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in it, which hybridizes with a cDNA probe specific for beta 2m </plain></SENT>
