<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used IM-9 cells in order to examine whether unoccupied <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptors are inactivated and activated in intact cells. when IM-9 cells are incubated in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-free medium in a nitrogen atmosphere, both their ability to bind triamcinolone acetonide and their ATP levels decline and, when <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and oxygen are reintroduced, ATP levels and receptor activity return </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The specific <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>-binding activity of cytosol prepared from cells exposed to various degrees of energy limitation is directly correlated with the ATP content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Receptor activation in intact cells is rapid and independent of protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytosol prepared from inactivated cells cannot be activated by addition of ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inactivation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptors that occurs when cytosol from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IM-9 cells is incubated at 25 degrees C is inhibited by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36264">molybdate</z:chebi>, vanadate, <z:chebi fb="36" ids="17051">fluoride</z:chebi>, ATP, and several other <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The experiments with intact human lymphoblasts suggest that assays of specific <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>-binding capacity do not necessarily reflect the cellular content of receptor protein </plain></SENT>
