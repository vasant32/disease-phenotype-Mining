<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The necessity of rituximab internalisation for CI-PCD induction was investigated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines with (e.g. Mutu I) and without (Mutu III) susceptibility to rituximab-induced killing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry demonstrated small, significant and similar amounts of rituximab internalisation by Mutu I cells after 1, 2, 4 and 24 h (p &lt; 0.03, n = 5) and Mutu III cells after 0.5, 2, 4 and 24 h (p &lt; 0.05, n = 4) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">Cytochalasin</z:chebi> B and latrunculin A significantly inhibited rituximab-induced CI-PCD (p &lt; or = 0.04, n = 6 and p = 0.01, n = 6, respectively) and internalisation (p = 0.02, n = 5 and p = 0.0002, n = 6, respectively) in Mutu I cells, but confocal microscopy showed no correlation between internalised rituximab and phosphatidylserine exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that rituximab internalisation is not essential for CI-PCD induction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
