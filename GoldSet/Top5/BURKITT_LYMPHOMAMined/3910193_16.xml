<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologic material from lymphoid tissue was available for review on 24 of the 50 Wiskott-Aldrich patients followed by the Metabolism Branch of the NCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 17 patients, specimens were obtained by biopsy performed for diagnosis of lymphoid mass lesions, and in 16 patients autopsy specimens were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 9 of the 24 patients a diagnosis of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A distinct preponderance of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) over <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) with a ratio 8:1 was observed, and the overall incidence of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 50 patients was 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common histologic subtype of NHL was large cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was made antemortem, most often presenting in extranodal sites or the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Involvement of peripheral lymph nodes was conspicuous by its absence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunoperoxidase staining for kappa and lambda chain immunoglobulin and lysozyme was negative in the four cases studied, failing to provide supportive evidence for a B-cell or true histiocytic origin for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histologic subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> commonly observed in childhood, such as Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite treatment with combination chemotherapy in some patients, there were no long-term remissions and median survival was less than one year following the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
