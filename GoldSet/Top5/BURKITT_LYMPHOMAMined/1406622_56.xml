<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have cloned a human cDNA from a new gene, spi-B, on the basis of its homology with the DNA-binding domain of the Spi-1/PU.1 putative oncogene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>spi-B codes for a protein of 262 amino acids presenting 43% overall identity with Spi-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its highly basic carboxy-terminal region exhibits 34% sequence identity with the DNA-binding domain of the Ets-1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We showed that the Spi-B protein is able to bind the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi>-rich sequence (PU box) recognized by Spi-1/PU.1 and to activate transcription of a reporter plasmid containing PU boxes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosome in situ hybridization allowed us to map spi-B to the 19q13.3-19q13.4 region of the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>spi-B, like spi-1, was found to be expressed in various murine and human hematopoietic cell lines except T lymphoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
