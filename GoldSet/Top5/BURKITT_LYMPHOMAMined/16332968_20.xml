<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>EBV-positive nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and Hodgkin, T, and natural killer (NK) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> express EBNA-1 and the latent membrane proteins (LMP1-2; type II latency) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to type III EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines, in these cells the LMPs are expressed in the absence of EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that exposure to CD40 ligand and IL-4 could induce LMP-1 in an in vitro EBV-infected Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell line, which expressed only EBNA-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show now that both human and EBV-encoded IL-10 can induce LMP-1 in the absence of EBNA-2 in the Daudi, P3HR1, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, induction of LMP-1 was not accompanied by the downregulation of BCL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-10 could also induce LMP-1 in the conditional lymphoblastoid cell line ER/EB2-5 where EBNA-2 was downregulated in the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, IL-10 could induce the expression of LMP-1 in tonsillar B cells infected with the nontransforming, EBNA-2-deficient EBV strain P3HR1 and enhance LMP-1 expression in 2 EBV-positive NK <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The demonstration that IL-10 can induce the expression of LMP-1 in an EBNA-2-independent manner shows that the major transforming EBV gene LMP-1 can be induced by extracellular signals in lymphoid cells, and IL-10 might contribute to the establishment of type II EBV latency </plain></SENT>
