<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eukaryotic translation can be initiated either by a cap-dependent mechanism or by internal ribosome entry, a process by which ribosomes are directly recruited to structured regions of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> upstream of the initiation codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the finding of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the untranslated region of the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBNA1 is the only nuclear protein expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known states of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency and in the virus lytic cycle, and is required for the maintenance of the EBV episome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using cDNA reporter constructs and in vitro transfection assays, we found that sequences contained in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the Fp and Qp initiated EBNA1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increased the expression level 4-14- fold in different Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The U leader exon, located within the 5' UTR, included in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known EBNA1 transcripts and also contained in the EBNA3, 4 and 6 mRNAs, was demonstrated by bicistronic expression analyses to contain an IRES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EBNA IRES initiates translation more efficiently than the encephalomyocarditis virus IRES in EBV-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that the EBNA IRES constitute a novel mechanism, whereby EBV regulates latent gene expression </plain></SENT>
