<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal antibody designated L2 was produced against a late intracellular protein induced by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This protein was expressed in cells producing virus but not in EBV genome-positive nonproducer cell lines, EBV genome-negative cell lines, or producer cultures cultivated in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15732">phosphonoacetic acid</z:chebi> as determined by immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the antibody did not react with the membranes of infected cells indicating that it was not directed against an EBV-induced membrane antigen component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal antibody was shown to recognize a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> with a molecular weight of approximately 125K by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> was consistently found to be slightly larger when isolated from the P3HR-1 cell line as opposed to the B-95-8 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar difference was also noted by comparison of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> maps of this protein isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography from the two cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serological studies indicated that this 125K <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> was a major component of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid-antigen (VCA) complex as defined by immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
