<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the expression of the MYC gene at both the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels to determine how these parameters are related in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and in nonmalignant lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To do this we have adopted a multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization methodology, which has allowed us to investigate the expression of different genes at the same time in the same cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have made use of the digital imaging capabilities of a charge-coupled device camera system to quantify the hybridization signals for the MYC gene and, by comparing these to the expression of a control gene (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase; GAPDH), have obtained relative quantitations of MYC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we have compared cells both within and outside the germinal centers in control tissues (reactive lymph nodes and tonsils) and in low-grade follicular center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, as well as cells in high-grade diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MYC/GAPDH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> hybridization signal ratios were calculated and found to be higher in cell populations containing a majority of malignant cells (p &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when the myc/GAPDH protein hybridization signal ratios were calculated, these were significantly higher in malignant cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> than the ratios observed in the nonmalignant cells (p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that the environment in a malignant cell may contribute to the stabilization of the myc protein, thus enabling it to function for a longer time period than in nonmalignant cells </plain></SENT>
