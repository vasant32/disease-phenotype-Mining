<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The antitumor activities of immunotoxins (ITs) constructed with deglycosylated ricin A chain (dgA) and either anti-CD19 (HD37) or anti-CD22 (RFB4) monoclonal antibodies were compared in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice with disseminated human Daudi <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>/Daudi) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As reported previously, after intravenous injection with Daudi cells, <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice develop disseminated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which infiltrates the vertebral column and causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> of the hind legs before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> time (MPT) has been taken as an end point in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that early treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>/Daudi mice with RFB4 coupled to dgA prolongs the MPT in a manner consistent with the killing of 4 logs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we show that HD37-dgA kills 2 logs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lower potency of the HD37-dgA is consistent with its lower IC50 on Daudi cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further show that the antitumor activity of a mixture of HD37-dgA and RFB4-dgA is significantly enhanced in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>/Daudi mice and is consistent with the killing in excess of 5 logs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, identical enhancement was observed when a mixture of the RFB4-dgA and the HD37 antibody was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, enhancement was not observed when mice were injected with a mixture of the RFB4 antibody and the HD37-dgA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that a "cocktail" of HD37 antibody and RFB4-dgA immunotoxin can have significant antitumor activity in this mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and suggest that combinations of particular antibodies and ITs may have cooperative antitumor activity </plain></SENT>
