<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the 293S cell line, of human embryonic kidney origin, is an excellent host cell for mammalian gene expression, these cells have a tendency to form large and tight aggregates in suspension cultures and bioreactors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To solve the problem of aggregation, 293S cells were fused to a human suspension cell line, 2B8 (a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> derivative), using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-treated 293S and 2B8 cells were selected in a medium supplemented with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22526">aminopterin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> and G418 (1 mg/ml) to eliminate nonfused cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These hybrid clones, designated as HKB (hybrid of kidney and B cells), are negative for endogenous immunoglobulin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most clones are readily adaptable to serum-free suspension culture under <z:mp ids='MP_0000745'>shaking</z:mp> conditions without forming large and tight aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One clone, HKB11, was shown to support high-level expression of cytokines [interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4], ICAM-1 and rFVIII in a side-by-side comparison with 293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The above-described characteristics of HKB cells indicate that HKB11 is a favorable cell host for the production of human therapeutic proteins </plain></SENT>
