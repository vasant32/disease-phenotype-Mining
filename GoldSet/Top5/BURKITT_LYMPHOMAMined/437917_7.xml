<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rate of referral from rural areas was greater than that from urban areas, despite a probable bias toward referral from urban areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distribution of cases in Ghana appeared to be non-random but we attribute this to variable access to medical care and physician interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rainfall did not appear to be an important factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seasonal variation and time-space clustering were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence here seems lower than that reported in East Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence of an environmental influence with a short incubation period, as has been postulated for this disease in East Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The higher risk among rural patients is consistent with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> being a factor in the etiology of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
