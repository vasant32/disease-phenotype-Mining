<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In France, incidence rates were stable over the 15 last years with around 1500 cases each year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A very small fraction of cases is attributable to known risk factors, including heritable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in children with heritable predisposing diseases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> induced by high doses of ionizing radiation of medical or accidental origin, by chemotherapeutic or immunosuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Responsibility of Epstein Barr virus in a fraction of Hodgkin's and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is also established, even though little is still known on the cofactors involved in industrial countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other virus could cause <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, as suggested by localized increases in incidence in various conditions of population mixing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, there is some evidence that early common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> could be protective toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> risk, probably through their contribution to the maturation of the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several agents are suspected to induce chemical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, particularly pesticides, which are consistently reported in childhood <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006118" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is more and more likely that genetic factors may modulate risk induced of environmental factors </plain></SENT>
