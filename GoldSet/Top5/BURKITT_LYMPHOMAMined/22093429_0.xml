<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Data from 18 children with ATLS in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were collected to assess their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden at diagnosis and before chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evaluation was performed at the 8th day, 3 month, and the end of chemotherapy and follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of ATLS in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and the relationship between the incidence of ATLS and whether the kidney was involved and large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden were analyzed respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received hydration, alkalinization and received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> routinely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Urate oxidase and hemodialysis treatment were administered in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Of the 103 children with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 18 were diagnosed as having ATLS (17.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the 18 cases with ATLS were histopathologically confirmed as having Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were at stage III or IV and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sizes, and 7 were found to have blasts in the bone marrow&gt;25% (38.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">Lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) levelsâ‰¥1000 U/L were found in 11 (61.1%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had developed <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002905'>hyperphosphatemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002901'>hypocalcemia</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009644'>uremia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In terms of clinical features and prognosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100520'>oliguria</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100519'>anuria</z:hpo> at different levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo>, 7 patients experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The etiology in five was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002901'>hypocalcemia</z:hpo> and two had reversible posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> syndrome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> responded well to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nine cases of ATLS responded to supportive care, 4 required hemodialysis, and the other 4 responded to urate oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Ten cases survived and 8 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was severe complications and treatment was given up in 5 cases and recurrence occurred in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ATLS was commonly seen in Burkitt's subtype of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Higher LDH and large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sizes and kidney involvement were important risk factors for the development of ATLS in children with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Treatments with hydration, alkalinization and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> were safe and effective </plain></SENT>
