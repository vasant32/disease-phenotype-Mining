<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells at the early plateau phase in culture were much more resistant to BLM than at the exponential phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The late plateau-phase cells showed the highest sensitivity to the drug among the three phases of growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After exposure to BLM, no recovery in survival was found for the cells in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice grew exponentially with about a threefold longer cell cycle time than the cells in culture, but the age-distribution of cells in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was similar to that of the exponentially growing culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cells in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> were killed by BLM in a biphasic manner and did not show any significant recovery in survival after an injection of the drug, as found with the cells in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate a deficiency in the repair of potentially lethal damage in Burkitt cells induced by BLM; this may be one of the reasons for the high sensitivity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to the drug </plain></SENT>
