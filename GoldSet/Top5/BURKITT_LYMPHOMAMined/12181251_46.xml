<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim was to confirm these results in a larger, international, multi-centre study using International Prognostic Index-based criteria to assign prognostic groups, whilst slightly simplifying the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase II study where: (i) low risk (LR) patients were treated with three cycles of modified CODOX-M; and (ii) high risk (HR) patients received treatment with four cycles of alternating modified CODOX-M and IVAC chemotherapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results are given for 52 of 72 registered patients whose pathological eligibility was confirmed by central pathology review: 12 LR plus 40 HR </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, 2-year event-free survival (EFS) was 64.6% (95% CI 50.4% to 78.9%) and 2-year overall survival (OS) was 72.8% (95% CI 59.4% to 86.3%) </plain></SENT>
