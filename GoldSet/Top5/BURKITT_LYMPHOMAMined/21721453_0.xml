<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Since trephine bone marrow biopsy is an invasive procedure, the identification of a subgroup of patients with Non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) who have a minimal risk of bone marrow involvement would be helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is aimed to determine the incidence of bone marrow involvement (BMI) by NHL and the predictors of no BMI to not only avoid this invasive procedure but also decrease the cost of investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data from 320 patients with NHL at division of hematology between January 2008 and June 2009 were reviewed and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cell types of NHL were classified as B-cell in 283 patients (88.4%), T-cell in 37 patients (11.6%) and incidence of BMI is 24.4% and 18.9% in B- and T-cell, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors significantly associated with BMI in univariate analysis were the hepatic and splenic involvement (p = 0.03 and &lt; 0.01, respectively), significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (p = 0.02), presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) below diaphragm (p = 0.02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (p = 0.001), low percent of blood neutrophil (p &lt; 0.001), high percent of blood lymphocyte (p &lt; 0.001), low absolute neutrophil count (p = 0.002), high absolute lymphocyte count (p = 0.045), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>low platelet count</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001), high LDH (p = 0.026), and high alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the multivariate analysis, factors associated with BMI included <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> below diaphragm, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, low percent of blood neutrophil and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>low platelet count</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Excluding Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, NHL patients with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> below diaphragm, no hepatic &amp; splenic involvement, no significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) &gt;11 g/dL and platelet &gt; 150,000/uL had BMI in 3/78 (3.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of bone marrow involvement in NHL is 23.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Excluding Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, NHL patients with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> below diaphragm, no hepatic &amp; splenic involvement, no significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, Hb &gt; 11 g/dL and platelet &gt; 150,000/uL had low risk of BMI </plain></SENT>
