<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The angiogenic status and the exact role of the angiogenic cytokines in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> has not been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the profile of the systemic components of angiogenic regulation in B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) and B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL), namely vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), endostatin and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> patients, sVEGF, and MMP-9 were significantly lower than control levels at diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001) and increased to near control levels in remission (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both serum TNF-alpha and endostatin levels showed no significant difference at diagnosis (p&gt;0.05) and in remission (p&gt;0.05) compared to control levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VEGF, TNF-alpha, MMP-9 and endostatin levels were not significantly correlated with peripheral white cell count or bone marrow blast cell count, but were positively correlated with platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In B-CLL patients, serum VEGF, MMP-9 and TNF-alpha were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001 = 0.009, 0.007, respectively) and decreased to near control levels in remission (p&gt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum endostatin levels showed no significant difference at diagnosis and in remission compared to control levels (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant positive correlation between VEGF, TNF-alpha, MMP-9 and peripheral white cell counts, bone marrow lymphocytic count and platelets count were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that the driving forces of angiogenic factors (VEGF, TNF-alpha and MMP-9) in adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> appears different from that in B-CLL patients </plain></SENT>
