<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results were very similar to those obtained with the complement lysis procedure in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This immunomagnetic procedure was used in 123 cases of autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the cases demonstrated, first, that the procedure induced a significant loss of mononuclear cells but was not toxic for BM precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delays to engraftment observed in a few patients were probably due to the combination of pejorative factors, especially the damage caused to the micro-environment by previous heavy and prolonged chemotherapy or the double ABMT programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, patients presented with profound T-cell defect with undetectable IL2 secretion up to 1 year post-graft but they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> NK functions from the first month post-graft, these functions exceeding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values on the second and third months post-graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, in 20 cases, dual-immunofluorescence staining permitted the demonstration that the autograft contained malignant cells before purging that were eliminated by the immunomagnetic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
