<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (OGAT) and the mismatch repair system (MRS) play a crucial role in the susceptibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells to the cytotoxic effects of agents that generate O6-methylguanine in DNA, including the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35468">triazene</z:chebi> compound temozolomide (TMZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies performed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) showed that TMZ was scarcely active on lymphocyte functions not dependent on cell proliferation (e.g. NK activity and cytokine-mediated induction of CD1b molecule in adherent MNC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TMZ depressed proliferation and lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cell generation in response to IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this case, a reasonably good inverse relationship was found between OGAT levels of MNC and their susceptibility to TMZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study also analyzed the ratio of the toxic effect of TMZ on MNC and on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (i.e. "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e>-Immune Function Toxicity Index", TIFTI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A particularly favorable TIFTI can be obtained when OGAT levels are extremely high in MNC and markedly low in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This holds true for MRS-proficient neoplastic cells, but not for MRS-deficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, strategies aimed at modulating OGAT and MRS may improve the clinical response to TMZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the use of OGAT inhibitors to potentiate the antitumor activity of TMZ might result in a concomitant increase of the immunosuppressive effects of the drug, thus reducing the relative TIFTI </plain></SENT>
