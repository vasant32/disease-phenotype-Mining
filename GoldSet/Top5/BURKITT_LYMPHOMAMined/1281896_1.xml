<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunological analyses of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> to express surface and/or cytoplasmic immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal analysis was performed in five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of the five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had the chromosomal translocation, t(8;14), and one had t(2;8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients had extremely high IgG antibody titers to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (VCA) and to EBV early antigens (EA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had positive antibodies to EA, and two others had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antibody patterns comparable to those of EBV-seropositive age- and sex-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of the seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (57.1%) were positive for EBV-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA) by anticomplement immunofluorescence and/or EBV DNA using DNA-DNA reassociation kinetics, and/or Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of EBV positivity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients residing in Hokkaido was higher than that of cases previously reported in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of the four EBV genome-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients responded well to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and/or surgical treatment, with no significant relapse being observed during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, EBV genome-negative patients had poor prognoses despite having similar levels of clinical staging at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
