<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The proposal that the stable expression of organogenesis-directing plasma membrane antigens, such as testis-organizing H-Y antigen, requires beta2-microglobulin-MHC antigen dimers as anchorage sites was tested on Daudi human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells [46, XY, 15q-, 14q+, beta2-m(-), HLA(-)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The H-Y antigen level of Daudi was only 20% of that of Raji and Ramos, two human male pseudodiploid Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines that were beta2-m(+), HLA(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When Daudi is hybridized with beta2-m(+), HLA(+) cell lines, beta2-microglobulin, supplied by the latter, is known to restore the expression of Daudi HLA antigens A10 and BW17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such restoration of HLA antigen expression markedly elevated H-Y antigen levels in those somatic hybrids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus the H-Y antigen level of the Daudi x Raji 8A (male X male) hybrid became equal to that of TetraRaji--the colcemide-induced Raji tetraploid line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two independently derived Daudi x Hela D98 (male x female) hybrids, DAD 1 and DAD 10, demonstrated even higher H-Y antigen levels comparable to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> male peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
