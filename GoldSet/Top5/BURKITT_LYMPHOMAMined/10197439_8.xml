<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We paper describe a mass spectrometric approach generally applicable for the rapid identification and characterization of proteins isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The highly sensitive nanoflow-electrospray mass spectrometry employing a quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer was used for the direct identification of proteins from the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mixture generated from only one high resolution 2-DE gel without high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation or Edman sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to the high sensitivity and high mass accuracy of the instrument employed, this technique proved to be a powerful tool for the identification of proteins from femtomole amounts of materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We applied the technique for the investigation of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> BL60 cell proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This cell line has been used as a model to assign <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-associated proteins by subtractive analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From the nuclear fraction of these cells, 36 protein spots were examined, from only one micropreparative Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 stained gel, after proteolytic digestion by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and nanospray mass spectrometry (MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In combination with database searches, of 33 proteins were successfully identified by nanospray-MS/MS-sequencing of up to eight <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> per protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three proteins were new proteins not listed in any of the available databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some of the identified proteins are known to be involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> processes, the others were common proteins in the eukaryotic cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The given technique and the protein data are the basis for construction of a database to compare <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-induced cells and, further, to enable fast screening of drug impact in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-associated processes </plain></SENT>
