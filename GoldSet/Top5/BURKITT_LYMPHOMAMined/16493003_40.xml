<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we compared outcomes in 188 patients enrolled in chemotherapy trials and 186 HLA-matched sibling transplants, treated between 1991 and 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Groups were similar except that chemotherapy recipients were younger (median age, 5 versus 8 years) and less likely to have combined marrow and extramedullary relapse (19% versus 30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To adjust for time-to-transplant bias, treatment outcomes were compared using left-truncated Cox regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative efficacy of chemotherapy and transplantation depended on time from diagnosis to first relapse and the transplant conditioning regimen used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For children with early first relapse (&lt; 36 months), risk of a second relapse was significantly lower after total body irradiation (TBI)-containing transplant regimens (relative risk [RR], 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33-0.71, P &lt; .001) than chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, for children with a late first relapse (&gt; or = 36 months), risks of second relapse were similar after TBI-containing regimens and chemotherapy (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.49-1.70, P = .78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support HLA-matched sibling donor transplantation using a TBI-containing regimen in second CR for children with ALL and early relapse </plain></SENT>
