<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines CA46, JD40, and ST486, the second and third c-myc exons have been translocated into the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to this rearrangement, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell lines, we have found that the translocated c-myc exons show low-level amplification relative to restriction fragments from the germ-line c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patterns of hybridization of an IgM switch region probe suggest that immunoglobulin heavy chain sequences have been co-amplified with the translocated c-myc sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differential sedimentation was used to determine whether the amplified sequences reside in high-molecular-weight chromosomes or low-molecular-weight extrachromosomal DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In JD40 and ST486 cells, the amplified c-myc sequences were found on high-molecular-weight chromosomes ST486 cells also contained translocated C-myc sequences in low-molecular-weight, extrachromosomal DNA, as did CA46 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These conclusions were corroborated by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) of HeLa, CA46, ST486 and JD40 metaphase chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that there is ongoing selection for cells containing amplified copies of the expressed c-myc sequences. and that there is continuous generation of extrachromosomal copies of the translocated c-myc sequences in ST486 and CA46 cells </plain></SENT>
