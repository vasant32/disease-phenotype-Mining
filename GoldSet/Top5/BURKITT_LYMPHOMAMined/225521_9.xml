<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cultures were monitored for cell growth and HSV-1 DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBV-converted BJAB cultures were more permissive for HSV-1 infection than BJAB cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant cell killing and HSV-1 DNA synthesis were observed during the first 48 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the EBV-converted BJAB cultures but not in the BJAB cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The EBV-converted BJAB-B1 cell line contains an appreciable fraction of EBV-negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it was cloned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBV-positive and -negative cells were identified by using EBV-determined nuclear antigen anti-complement immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two types of subclones were identified: (i) those which contained both EBV-determined nuclear antigen-positive and -negative cells and (ii) those which contained only EBV-determined nuclear antigen-negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When levels of HSV-1 DNA synthesis were measured in these subclones, it was found that the former were more permissive for HSV-1 infection than the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the presence of the EBV genome in BJAB cells correlates with increased permissiveness of these cells for HSV-1 during the first 48 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, persistent HSV-1 infections were established in both BJAB and EBV-converted BJAB-B1 cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No differences in extent of permissiveness for HSV-1 infection were found for Ramos and EBV-converted AW-Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
