<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The B cell adaptor molecule of 32 kDa (Bam32) is an adaptor that links the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) to ERK and JNK activation and ultimately to mitogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After BCR cross-linking, Bam32 is recruited to the plasma membrane and accumulates within F-actin-rich membrane ruffles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bam32 contains one Src homology 2 and one pleckstrin homology domain and is phosphorylated at a single site, tyrosine 139 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To define the function of Bam32 in membrane-proximal signaling events, we established human B cell lines overexpressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or mutant Bam32 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basal level of F-actin increased in cells expressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or myristoylated Bam32 but decreased in cells expressing either an Src homology-2 or Tyr-139 Bam32 mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Bam32 also affected BCR-induced actin remodeling, which was visualized as increases in F-actin-rich membrane ruffles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Bam32 mutants largely blocked the BCR-induced increase in cellular F-actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positive and negative effects of Bam32 variants on F-actin levels were closely mirrored by their effects on the activation of the GTPase Rac1, which is known to regulate actin remodeling in lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bam32-deficient DT40 B cells showed decreased Rac1 activation and a failure of Rac1 to co-localize with the BCR, whereas cells overexpressing Bam32 had increased constitutive Rac1 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Bam32 regulates the cytoskeleton through Rac1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bam32 variants also affected downstream signaling to JNK in a manner similar to that of Rac1, suggesting that the effect of Bam32 on JNK activation may be at least partially mediated through Rac1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate a novel phosphorylation-dependent function of Bam32 in regulating Rac1 activation and actin remodeling </plain></SENT>
