<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To further study the mechanisms by which surface Ig triggering activates the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> signaling pathway, we have used B cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> patients which, as previously described, display two patterns of response upon sIg cross-linking: in one group this cross-linking induces an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24846">inositol phosphate</z:chebi> release, an intracellular free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentration elevation and a subsequent cell proliferation; in a second group none of these events occur although there is an increased class II Ag expression following anti-mu stimulation as in the first group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have been able to demonstrate that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) can be activated in permeabilized B cells from the first group by direct stimulation, with GPT gamma S, of a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> nucleotide binding (G) protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, since anti-mu + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43000">GTP gamma S</z:chebi> stimulate an increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24846">inositol phosphate</z:chebi> production in these cells, this suggests that surface Ig cross-linking activates PI-PLC via a G protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in cells from the second group no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24846">inositol phosphate</z:chebi> is released after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43000">GTP gamma S</z:chebi> stimulation although PI-PLC can be directly activated by high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This reflects in these cells, an interruption of the signaling cascade sIg/G protein/PI-PLC at the level of the G protein or at the G protein/PI-PLC coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cells from both groups <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> treatment, which is known to alter <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> metabolism in B cells, completely inhibits PI-PLC activation even by high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies show that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi>-dependent signaling cascade after surface Ig triggering can be altered at different levels in B cells </plain></SENT>
