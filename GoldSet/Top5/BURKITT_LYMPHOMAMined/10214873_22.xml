<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Primary effusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PEL) is a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> entity occurring predominantly, but not exclusively in HIV+ patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PEL grows exclusively in body cavities as serous lymphomatous effusion without evidence of mass disease or dissemination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells are infected with the newly discovered human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), often accompanied by co-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines have been established from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>- and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated PEL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Given their phenotypical relationship to plasma cells, several cytokines may be important for growth and survival of PEL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated the spectrum of cytokines produced by nine HHV-8+ PEL cell lines, in comparison with five Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, seven other B non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) and seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we tested the response of the PEL cells to selected cytokines and the effects of neutralizing anti-cytokine and anti-cytokine receptor antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using specific ELISAs, PEL cell lines were found to produce large amounts of interleukin-6 (IL-6; 10-5000 pg/ml), IL-6 soluble receptor (IL-6sR; 30-600 pg/ml), IL-10 (600-80,000 pg/ml) and oncostatin M (OSM; 50-80 pg/ml) which in most cases were significantly higher than the levels produced by the Burkitt, B-NHL or <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines; on the contrary, PEL cell lines did not elaborate significant levels of macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP-1alpha) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> inhibitory factor (LIF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the levels of MIP-1alpha were increased 10- to 100-fold by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PEL cell lines did not respond proliferatively to IL-6, IL-10, IL-11, LIF, MIP-1alpha, or OSM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Incubation with IL-6sR and IL-6 inhibited cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anti-IL6 neutralizing antibodies had no effect on PEL cell line proliferation; conversely, whereas anti-IL6R alone inhibited only weakly, anti-gp130 and anti-gp130 plus anti-IL6R showed strong inhibitory effects (&gt;20% inhibition in 5/9 lines and &gt;60% inhibition in 3/9 lines) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In summary, PEL cell lines produce high amounts of cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, OSM); proliferation could be inhibited by blocking the receptors of the IL-6 signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
