<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that transfection of the EBV BZLF1 gene causes the disappearance of EBNA proteins on Western blots (immunoblots) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these results, we attempted to eliminate EBV plasmids in Raji cells by transfecting a BZLF1 plasmid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 33 clones that were cotransfected with a BZLF1 plasmid and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16976">hygromycin B</z:chebi> resistance plasmid and selected resistant for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16976">hygromycin B</z:chebi>, 24 clones had decreased numbers of EBV plasmids, as revealed by the decrease in the intensity of the EBV band on Southern blots compared with that of nontransfected Raji cells </plain></SENT>
