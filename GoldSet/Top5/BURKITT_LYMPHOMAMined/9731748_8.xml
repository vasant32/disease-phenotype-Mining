<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Activation of the cAMP signaling pathway in lymphoid cells is known to inhibit cell proliferation of T and B cells as well as cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to find suitable model systems to study cAMP-mediated processes, we have examined the expression of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), endogenous levels of cAMP, and cell proliferation in eight cell lines of B lineage origin, four cell lines of T lineage origin, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B and T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein for one of the regulatory (R) subunits of PKA (RIalpha) was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cells investigated, in contrast to the other R subunits (RIbeta, RIIalpha, and RIIbeta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, three T cell lines and one B cell line expressed only RIalpha and C, implying these cells to contain solely PKA type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, for the RI subunit, we observed an apparent reciprocal relationship between levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Generally, RIalpha protein was low in cell lines where <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was elevated and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was not the case for the RII subunits, where high levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were associated with elevated levels of protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we demonstrated an inverse correlation between levels of endogenous cAMP and cell growth as determined by [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation and cell-doubling rate (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results demonstrate great differences in PKA isozyme composition, which should be taken into consideration when using lymphoid cell lines as model system for cAMP/PKA effects in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
