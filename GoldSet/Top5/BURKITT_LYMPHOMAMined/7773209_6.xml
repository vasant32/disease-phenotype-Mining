<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As chemotherapy and growth factor priming could lead to important qualitative and quantitative alterations of lymphoid cells, we also looked at the distribution of lymphoid cells contained in primed PBSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, different variables were defined for successful application of the technique to clinical protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells were placed in culture at varying cell densities in either serum-containing or serum-free culture medium, supplemented with IL-2, 100 or 1000 Cetus units/ml at 37 degrees C for 24 or 72 h, in flasks or in culture bags </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cytotoxicity was tested against A375 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>), K562 (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and Daudi (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) cell lines in standard 4 h <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marked cytotoxicity was seen against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines tested (A375: 32.7% +/- 5.2; K562: 52.8% +/- 4.8; Daudi: 50.5% +/- 7.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity was comparable in serum-containing and serum-free culture conditions and in tissue culture flasks and bags </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell density up to 10 x 10(6)/ml was not associated with any significant decline in cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL-2 activation of PBSC after thawing led to the generation of cytotoxicity comparable to that obtained with fresh PBSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On flow cytometric analysis, the proportion of CD8+ T cells and NK cells (CD56+) was found to be higher in primed PBSC than in control peripheral blood mononuclear cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
