<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the activity of reporter plasmids, carrying the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen (EBNA) promoters Wp and Cp, in a group of somatic cell hybrids obtained by fusing EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines or group II/III Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines with non-B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In B/non-B cell hybrids of this type, B cell markers are extinguished as a rule, in parallel with the inactivation of Cp or Wp and down-regulation of EBNA-2-6 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A Wp-carrying reporter construct was active in non-B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only cells with a B <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> could support the activity of Cp-carrying plasmids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBNA-2 transactivated Cp only in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that while Wp can be used for EBNA transcription in B and non-B cells, Cp activity is restricted to B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inability of EBNA-2 to transactivate Cp in non-B cells indicates that other factors present in B cells might be involved in Cp transactivation </plain></SENT>
