<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe here a T cell#150;independent in vitro induction assay, by which hypermutation is induced in BL2 cells through simultaneous aggregation of three surface receptors: IgM, CD19 and CD21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mutations arise as a post-transcriptional event within 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They are stably introduced in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, occurring in one of the two variable gene DNA strands, and eventually become fixed by replication in one of the daughter cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inactivation of AID (activation-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase) by homologous recombination in BL2 cells completely inhibits the process, thus validating this induction procedure as a model for the in vivo mechanism </plain></SENT>
