<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphomas</z:hpo> are a relatively common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complication of AIDS</z:e> in western countries, but little is known of the impact of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> epidemic in Africa on the risk of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the types of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) occurring in Kampala, Uganda, their association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and how their risk is modified by HIV and other variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study comparing NHL cases with age/sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cases included 50 histologically diagnosed adults (31 with validation and phenotyping) and 132 histologically diagnosed children (61 with validation and phenotyping) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls were adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> unrelated to HIV and children with non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most (90%) childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), with no association with HIV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases were mainly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (mostly EBV positive) or diffuse B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only a weak association was found with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e>; a more precise estimate was obtained with the total series (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.9-5.1) than validated/phenotyped cases (OR 2.1, 95% CI 0.3-6.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher socioeconomic status adults, who travelled away from home, or had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036916" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="std|stds">sexually transmitted diseases</z:e>, appeared to have a moderately increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were predominantly endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, the risk of which was not modified by HIV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In adults, the risk associated with HIV was much lower in Uganda than in western countries, possibly because of the poor survival of immunosuppressed HIV-positive individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future studies will require careful attention to subtyping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, to investigate the possible differences between them </plain></SENT>
