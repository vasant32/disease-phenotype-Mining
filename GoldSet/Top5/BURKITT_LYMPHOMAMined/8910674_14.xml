<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, active and controllable cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, has demonstrated that the size of a cell population can be regulated by changes in the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate as well as in the rates of proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Factors which alter the rate of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, such as expression of the proto-oncogene bcl-2, can therefore directly affect the number of cells within a population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 has been shown to suppress <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to a variety of stimuli and to act as a complementary survival signal for the random acquisition of other oncogenic mutations, such as deregulated c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Epstein Barr virus (EBV) gene BHRF1 was the first of a family of bcl-2 homologues now being identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BHRF1 and bcl-2 share 25% primary amino acid sequence homology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we show that gamma radiation and several cytotoxic anticancer agents induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines, as has been found in several other systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using gene transfection studies we have also shown that expression of either BHRF1 or bcl-2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines significantly suppresses <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to a variety of anticancer treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This has confirmed that BHRF1 is functionally homologous to bcl-2 in B-cells and suggests that BHRF1 may act to prevent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, maximising virus particle production, as has been suggested for other human and insect <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Suppression of chemotherapeutic drug induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by bcl-2 and BHRF1 as demonstrated in this cell system, results in resistance to a variety of different agents and may represent an alternative mechanism by which multidrug resistance arises during chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
