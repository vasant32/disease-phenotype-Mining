<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the genes involved have not yet been clearly identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have molecularly characterized the recently established Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BLUE-1 that carries a t(6;20)(q15;q11.2) rearrangement in addition to the typical t(8;14) with MYC-IGH fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To identify the gene loci involved on both chromosomes we applied a sequential BAC clone mapping strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By using RT-PCR we were finally able to detect a chimeric <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcript showing a fusion of the first (non-coding) exon of BACH2 (BTB and <z:chebi fb="31" ids="48390">CNC</z:chebi> homology 1, basic leucine zipper transcription factor 2) on 6q15 to the second exon of BCL2L1 (BCL-X) on 20q11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Various fusion transcripts were detected for different BCL2L1 (BCL-XL) isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fusion ultimately results in strong expression of the BCL2L1 (BCL-XL) anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein, as demonstrated by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first report that shows the involvement of both BCL2L1 and the transcription factor BACH2 in a chromosomal rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It points to BACH2 as a possibly important target in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with 6q aberrations, although other genes on 6q are probably also involved in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it suggests that members of the BCL2 anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> gene family other than BCL2 itself might also be involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
