<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two cases expressed the VH3-30P1 gene with 88.6% and 86.7% homology when compared to their germinal counterpart, whereas the VH4-18 was rearranged in the third one (89% identity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these genes displayed high numbers of mutations (27, 22, 28 respectively), predominating in CDR regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The encoded light chain genes determined for cases 1 and 2 expressed the same V kappa I-018 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that: 1) Although, it is difficult to address the issue of VH usage based on the limited number of cases studied, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> may use a restricted repertoire of Ig genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2) Mutations and/or replacements predominated in CDR regions, which might suggest the occurrence of an antigen driven selection process, at least in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the high ratio of mutations observed in framework (FW) regions also favors the possibility that the antigen selection process is associated with polyclonal B cell stimulation </plain></SENT>
