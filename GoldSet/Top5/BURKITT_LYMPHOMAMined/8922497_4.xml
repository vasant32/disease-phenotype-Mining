<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cells commonly have a characteristic chromosomal translocation that includes 8q24 (the location of the c-myc protooncogene), the leukemic cells of the two patients reported in this paper showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of bone marrow cells in case 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A c-myc probe was used, and no rearrangement or amplification of c-myc expression was found; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> with the translocation including 8q24 is reported to show high levels of expression of rearranged c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Investigation of anti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody revealed that both cases 1 and 2 had a past history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, at least in case 1, integration of the EBV genomic DNA into the leukemic cells was not detected by the polymerase chain reaction in which specific primers for EBV were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference in pathophysiology between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> with and without the 8q24 translocation is unclear, however, the prognosis of the two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype was as poor as that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> with the chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
