<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We isolated mAb 33A, which inhibited the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of CD4-positive T cells, B cells, human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), and brain-derived cells with HIV-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Formation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA was also blocked when CD4-positive Raji cells were treated with 33A after adsorption of HIV-1, but not before its adsorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>mAb 33A had little effect on syncytium formation induced by cocultivation with HIV-1-producing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry revealed that 33A reacted with HTLV-I-positive T-cell lines, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) -stimulated PBL, brain-derived fibroblast-like cells, and some adherent cell lines, but hardly at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with immature T-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting experiments showed that 33A recognized an antigen with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa, but did not recognize chemokine receptors such as CXCR4, CCR5, or CCR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution characteristic of the antigen recognized by 33A on various cells and its molecular weight suggest that mAb 33A recognizes a new cellular antigen that is necessary for HIV-1 entry </plain></SENT>
