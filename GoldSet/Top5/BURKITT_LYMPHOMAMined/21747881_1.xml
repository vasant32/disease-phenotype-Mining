<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-eight patients diagnosed between July 1996 and December 2007 were treated using LMB 96, and 22 patients diagnosed between January 1991 and May 1998 (defined as the early period) were treated using the D-COMP or CCG-106B protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed their medical records and analyzed cumulative survival according to the treatment period by using Kaplan-Meier analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no intergroup differences in the distribution of age, disease stage, or risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period of the 33 live patients in the LMB group was 72 months (range, 36-170 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of patients treated using LMB 96 were 86.8%±5.5% and 81.6%±6.3%, respectively, whereas OS and EFS of patients treated in the early period were 72.7%±9.6% and 68.2%±9.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the LMB 96 group, OS of cases showing non-complete response (N=8) was 62.5%±17.1%, and OS of relapsed or primary refractory cases (N=6) was 33.3%±19.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) disease, high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase levels at diagnosis, and treatment response were significant prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Survival outcome has drastically improved over the last 2 decades with short-term, dose-intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement or poor response to chemotherapy was worse prognostic factors; therefore, future studies addressing this therapeutic challenge are warranted </plain></SENT>
