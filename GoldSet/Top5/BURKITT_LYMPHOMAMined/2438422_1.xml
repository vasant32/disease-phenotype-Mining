<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cryptic promoters located within the first intron are also activated to synthesize aberrant c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> in some Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a t(8: 14) chromosome translocation in which a part of the gene structure, often the 5' non-coding exon, is truncated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown elsewhere that microinjected plasmid DNA carrying a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, intact human c-myc gene directs efficient faithful transcription from its own two promoters in Xenopus laevis oocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, I have investigated the expression of different recombinants carrying various constructs of the c-myc gene in frog oocytes in order to understand the activation mechanism of those cryptic promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aberrant c-myc transcripts initiating from cryptic promoters within the first intron are undetectable when the intact or truncated c-myc gene construct is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the cryptic promoters can be activated in Xenopus oocytes if the truncated c-myc gene construct is fused with simian virus 40 sequences containing a 21 base-pair repeat and the replication origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Xenopus oocytes will be useful for further investigation of enhancing elements involved in the translocated and activated c-myc genes in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
