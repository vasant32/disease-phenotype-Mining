<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of aminophylline (AM), a non-specific PDE inhibitor, on Raji cells were explored in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay, light and transmission electron microscopy and annexin V staining were used to observe cell proliferation, morphologic changes and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate in AM-treated cells, and FCM and RT-PCR techniques were adopted to detect the effect on cell cycle, the expression of cyclin B1 and Bcl-2 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transmembrane potential in AM-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that AM inhibited the growth of Raji cells in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphologic observations showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> changes in AM-treated cells, including cytoplamic shrinkage, cytoplasmic bubbling, karyopyknosis and nuclear fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FCM and RT-PCR detection showed that AM intervention increased the fraction of annexin V(+) cells, reduced the value of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transmembrane potential, induced S phase arrest, and down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 at both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein level and cyclin B1 protein in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that PDE inhibitor aminophylline may induce Raji cell growth inhibition, S phase arrest, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> via down-regulation of Bcl-2 and reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transmembrane potential </plain></SENT>
