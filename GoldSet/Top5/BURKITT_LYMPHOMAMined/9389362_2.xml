<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the role of this tyrosine kinase in B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>, we investigated the expression of p56lck by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 12/16 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> derived cell lines, 3/3 lymphoblastoid cell lines, 1/6 Hodgkin's disease derived cell lines, and 10/10 freshly isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cells constitutive expression of the protein was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein tyrosine kinase assays detected a catalytic active form of p56lck in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p56lck expressing samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stimulation experiments of the different cell lines and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> cells by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> and the B-cell specific stimulation with SAC/anti-IgM respectively indicated a change of the expression level in comparison with the unstimulated cells and, a higher molecular weight species of the protein tyrosine kinase p56lck was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was probably due to hyperphosphorylation of p56lck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation between an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with the Epstein-Barr virus and the expression of p56lck was found in the cell lines used and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of p56lck activity by the specific inhibitor 4-amino-6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24698">hydroxyflavone</z:chebi> revealed a decrease of proliferation of the T-cell line Jurkat, but not of the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the analysed cell lines we found a reduction of the kinase activity of p56lck of approximately 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that lck may contribute to the maintenance of the transformation of the analysed B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> but that lck does not support a model for an initial event in B cell transformation </plain></SENT>
