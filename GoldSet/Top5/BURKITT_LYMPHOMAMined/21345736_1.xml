<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 15 HIV infected children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> by comparison with 30 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> but not infected with HIV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These children were admitted consecutively in two South African hospitals from 1995 to 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary localization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, stage, treatment, relapse and overall survival were the main areas of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distributions of studied variables in the two groups were tested for significance with statistic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution by age, sex and stage of disease was not significantly different between the two samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was, in both groups, more often in the abdomen than in the head, neck or other areas (53% of HIV positive cases and 80% of HIV negative cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The chemotherapy protocol was in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases LMB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mortality ratio was significantly higher in the HIV positive group: 73% (11 out of 15 cases) versus 23% (7/30) -p=0.002, while the length of follow-up was significantly shorter for the HIV infected children (average 30 months versus 48 months, p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> worsens significantly the prognosis of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, in spite of anti-retroviral and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
