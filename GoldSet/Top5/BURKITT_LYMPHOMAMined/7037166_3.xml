<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although one patient died within four months of diagnosis, the other has maintained a one year clinical complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical and morphologic picture of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> is nonspecific and therefore requires complementary studies including cytochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, cell surface markers and cytogenetics studies to establish diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspirations</z:hpo> with marker analyses may detect relapse at an earlier stage than conventional cytology, allowing therapy to be modified prior to overt clinical relapse </plain></SENT>
