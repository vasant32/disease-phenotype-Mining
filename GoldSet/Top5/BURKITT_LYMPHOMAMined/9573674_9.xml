<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Molecular genetic abnormalities have been frequently described in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These lesions have been associated with specific entities, allowing a better categorization of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, these abnormalities are not as specific as initially described and their association is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: By Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction, we have simultaneously analyzed the proto-oncogenes Bcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-6, c-myc and MLL and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes p53 and p16, in 100 unselected B-cell NHL patients at diagnosis, to establish its incidence throughout the different NHL subtypes, defined both by Working Formulation and REAL classifications, and to assess the frequency of co-existence of two or more genetic lesions within each individual patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty two cases displayed some genetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl-1, altered in 12 cases, was highly specific to mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (57% of them), but 6 cases had a different histologic subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 was rearranged in 26 cases: 70% in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) and 20% in diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; these abnormalities were also present in other subtypes, i.e. marginal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bcl-6 abnormalities were mostly found in diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (29%) but also found in other subgroups, like FL (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>C-myc rearrangements were specific to Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MLL gene was always germline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Deletions and/or rearrangements of p53 and p16 genes were rare (4% and 8% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, association of genetic lesions was a relatively common finding (13% of cases), especially in cases with adverse prognostic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> according to the REAL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Molecular abnormalities are frequent in NHL at diagnosis, not only as unique lesions but also associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A relative high specificity of some alterations was seen, thereby contributing to a better assessment of the histological subtype </plain></SENT>
