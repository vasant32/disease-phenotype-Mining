<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 68 patients with B-cell LAHS (B-LAHS) were older on average than the 64 who had T-cell or natural killer-cell LAHS (T/NK-LAHS) (median ages at diagnosis: 63.5 versus 49 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical signs of cytopenia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> were generally less severe in the former group than in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the prognosis was better for the B-LAHS group than the T/NK-LAHS group (median survival: 242 days versus 69 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus genome was detected by EBERs in situ hybridization in 3 of 24 B-LAHS patients examined, and in 19 of 23 T/NK-LAHS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on observed clinical manifestations, T/NK-LAHS was subdivided into 2 types: LAHS that developed in patients with nasal or nasal-type NK/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> during their clinical course; and LAHS as the initial presentation in T/NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In B-LAHS, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_654'>hemophagocytic syndrome</z:mpath> was the major initial symptom, and patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, 10 of 20 B-LAHS patients demonstrated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334660" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intravascular lymphomatosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the findings of this survey, we proposed a set of new diagnostic criteria for LAHS </plain></SENT>
