<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigate the clinical usefulness of this procedure in a large series of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a 5-year period (2000-2004), ultrasound-guided core needle biopsies were performed in 102 malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five diagnostic categories were considered: large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (LBCL), small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (SBCL), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and miscellaneous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical excisional biopsy of the node was performed in 47 cases (46.1%) for diagnostic confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy was 88.2% (90/102) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SBCL (39), LBCL (36), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> (15), T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (5), and miscellaneous (7) [including T cell-rich B cell (2), natural killer cell (1), Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1), and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the B cell type, NOS (3)] were correctly diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HDs</z:e>, 1 natural killer cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 1 LBCL were not correctly diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The core needle biopsy did not yield <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy is effective in the diagnosis of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and can be used as the first diagnostic approach in selected clinical situations </plain></SENT>
