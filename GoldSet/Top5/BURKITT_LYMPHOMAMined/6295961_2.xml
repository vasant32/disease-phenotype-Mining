<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A rabbit antiserum to immunopurified p105 was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]methionine-labeled p105 was specific to EBV-superinfected Raji cells, and its synthesis was not blocked with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15732">phosphonoacetic acid</z:chebi>, indicating that it is an "early" <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15732">Phosphonoacetic acid</z:chebi> treatment of EBV-superinfected Raji cells was associated with the accumulation, mainly in the cytosol, of an 88,000-dalton protein, p88, which was also recognized with anti-p105 serum, but was not detected in superinfected cells which had not been treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15732">phosphonoacetic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although anti-p105 serum immunoprecipitated a membrane fraction protein, it did not neutralize P3HR-1 virus and was not considered to be an exposed virion component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that p105 is an early, EBV-induced, membrane fraction antigen to which EBV-infected patients generate a substantial antibody response </plain></SENT>
