<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study compared the overall survival, the event-free survival, and the timing of chemotherapy in patients with advanced Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with and without laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients with advanced abdominal Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated at least partially at the Centre Léon Bérard between 1981 and 1992 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was obtained by laparotomy (LAP group) in 21 patients (17 stage III, 4 stage IV) and by other methods (non-LAP group) in 14 patients (5 stage III, 9 stage IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall survival (71 and 93%) and the event-free survival (66 and 79%) were similar in the LAP and non-LAP groups, and the relapse rate was five (three local) in the LAP group compared with three (none local) in the non-LAP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The local complication rate (9 of 21 versus 2 of 14) and the toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate (2 of 21 versus 1 of 14) were slightly higher in the LAP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Laparotomy also caused delays in therapy and increased the overall hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean interval from diagnosis to the start of the fourth course of chemotherapy was 57 days compared with 48 days and the average hospital stay was 44.4 days compared with 39 days for the LAP and non-LAP groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because advanced Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can be diagnosed by fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, and chemotherapy cures more than 80% of the patients, there is no need for initial surgery, apart from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> emergencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, laparotomy delay chemotherapy and might reduce the survival rate </plain></SENT>
