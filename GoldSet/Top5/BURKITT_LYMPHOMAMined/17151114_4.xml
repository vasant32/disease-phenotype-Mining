<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High expression of EBNA2 inversely correlated with expression of germinal center (GC)-associated genes, BCL6 and TCL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The decreased expression of BCL6 appeared to be dose dependent, with almost complete abrogation in highly EBNA2-expressing clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The role of EBNA2 in negative regulation of these genes was confirmed by transfection and in a hormone-inducible EBNA2 cell system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LMP1 transfection reduced expression of TCL1, but not of BCL6, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The GC-associated gene repression was at the transcriptional level and CBF1 independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A decrease in HLA-DR, surface immunoglobulin M, and class II transactivator expression and an increase in CCL3, a BCL6 repression target, was observed in EBNA2-expressing clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since BCL6 is indispensable for GC formation and somatic hypermutations (SHM), we suggest that the previously reported lack of SHM seen in EBNA2-expressing GC cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> tonsils could be due to negative regulation of BCL6 by EBNA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that EBNA2 interferes with the GC phenotype </plain></SENT>
