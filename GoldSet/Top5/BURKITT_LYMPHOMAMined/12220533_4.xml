<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although signaling by CD40 is initiated by the binding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family members to its cytoplasmic domain, whether those TRAF family proteins mediate enhancement of germline Cepsilon transcription is not evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here that CD40-induced TRAF3-dependent activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase 1 (MEK1) is involved in the upregulation of IL-4-driven germline C epsilon transcription in a human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cell line, DG75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the six known TRAF proteins, TRAF2, 3, 5, and 6 associated with CD40 in an unstimulated state, and the levels of these four proteins were unaffected by anti-CD40 stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) for TRAF3 inhibited CD40-induced activation of MEK1-ERK pathway by decreasing expression of TRAF3 protein, but antisense ODNs for TRAF2, 5, and 6 were ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CD40-mediated enhancement of IL-4-driven germline C epsilon transcription was inhibited by antisense ODN for TRAF3 and by a MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that in DG75 cells, TRAF3-induced MEK1 activation may be involved in CD40-mediated upregulation of IL-4-driven germline C epsilon transcription </plain></SENT>
