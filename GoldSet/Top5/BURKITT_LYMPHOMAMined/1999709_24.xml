<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As the number of long-term survivors of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> increases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> has emerged as a significant complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment of these children with growth hormone (GH) has been suggested and sporadically implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, studied the effect of human GH (hGH) and its by-product insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) on the growth of leukemic cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under serum-free conditions hGH and IGF-1 induced a significant dose-dependent proliferative effect on promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (HL60) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Daudi) cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-hGH antibodies negated the stimulatory effect of hGH and anti-IGF-1 serum abrogated the growth-promoting effect enhanced by IGF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar statistically significant stimulatory properties were found when freshly obtained marrow cells from four of five <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) of childhood and four <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients were studied in ALL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blast-cell clonogenic assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ALL colonies increased numerically by 72% (P less than .025) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> colonies by 92% (P less than .01) in the presence of hGH at concentrations of 2.5 x 10(2) and 3.0 x 10(2) ng/mL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IGF-1 stimulated ALL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blast-colony growth at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 ng/mL by up to 105% (P less than .025) and 65% (P less than .03), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our in vitro data suggest that circulating hGH and IGF-1 may promote leukemic blast cell replication in vivo, and the supplemental administration of hGH to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients in remission must be carefully monitored for early relapse </plain></SENT>
