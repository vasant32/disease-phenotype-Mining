<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two subTenon injections of steroids were performed on the right eye, with improvement of his right visual acuity from 5 to 10/10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells and snow balls disappeared but the vitreous became more fluffy and more organized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Investigations did not demonstrate any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vitreous haze progressed bilaterally and failed to respond to systemic steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A year later, visual acuity was limited to hand movements (OD) and remained at 9/10 (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vitreous haze + (OD) and ++ (OS) was extremely fluffy and moderately organized without inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vitrectomy was performed in both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Non inflammatory fibro-cellular membranes in a dense collagenous network with amorphous precipitates were observed in electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One year later, he developed a systemic B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This unusual case illustrates the possible evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012124'>intermediate uveitis</z:hpo> in a secondary PVR-like progressive non inflammatory vitreous haze with a particular increase of the amount of collagen fibrils and amorphous precipitates responsible for the fluffy aspect of the vitreous failing to respond to steroids </plain></SENT>
