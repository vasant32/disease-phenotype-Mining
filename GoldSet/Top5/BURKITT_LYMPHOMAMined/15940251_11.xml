<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The p50 NF-kappaB 1 component of Rel/NF-kappaB DNA-binding dimers regulates genes involved in both cell cycle traverse and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nfkb 1 loss accelerates B cell growth and leads to increased B cell turnover in vivo, phenotypes akin to those manifested in B cells of Emu-Myc transgenic mice, a model of human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Emu-Myc B cells express reduced levels of cytoplasmic and nuclear NF-kappaB 1 and have reduced Rel/NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity, suggesting that Myc-mediated repression of NF-kappaB 1 might mediate its proliferative and apoptotic effects on B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Nfkb 1 expression was reduced in the majority of Emu-Myc <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and was also suppressed in human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, loss of Nfkb 1 did not appreciably affect Myc's proliferative or apoptotic responses in B cells and had no effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> development in Emu-Myc mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Nfkb 1 is dispensable for Myc-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>. </plain></SENT>
