<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Application of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to the hypervariable segment of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene, allows detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> at a level of one leukaemic cell in 10(4)-10(5) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have performed a retrospective study using this technique in the assessment of children with precursor B-cell ALL in whom the clinical outcome is known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the early treatment period <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> is commonly detected in children who remain in complete remission on subsequent follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> at this time may have little value in the prediction of future relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, at the end of treatment, children who remain in complete remission have no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> at this time would seem to predict for future relapse, though this can be a delayed event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, in two children who suffered a bone marrow relapse 8.5 and 9 years after completing therapy for their initial disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> was detected, in their end of initial treatment marrow samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clearly PCR technology is changing the definition of the remission state in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e>, and may have predictive value in the assessment of children who are at a high risk of future relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Large prospective studies of molecular monitoring are now required to confirm these preliminary results </plain></SENT>
