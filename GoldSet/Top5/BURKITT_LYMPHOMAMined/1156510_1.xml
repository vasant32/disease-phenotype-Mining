<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells varied from 5 to 12 mum in diameter and had large round or oval nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A nucleolus was occasionally present and about 3% of cells showed projections of the nuclear envelope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytoplasm contained many ribosomes and several mitochondria but endoplasmic reticulum was sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A small number of cells contained annulate lamellae and crystalline structures were occasionally seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cells with immature intranuclear herpesvirus particles were rarely present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cells had many ultrastructural features in common with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines </plain></SENT>
