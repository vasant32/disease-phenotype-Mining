<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 1 (IL-1) has been obtained from the Epstein-Barr virus-infected B-lymphoblastoid cell line 3B6 and shown to be involved in autocrine growth of 3B6 B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Independently, adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-derived factor (ADF) was purified from human T-lymphotropic virus I-infected leukemic T-cell line (ATL-2) and reported as an interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor-inducing factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported the same molecular mass, pI, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal amino acid sequence for both 3B6-derived IL-1 and ADF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>cDNA cloning of ADF demonstrated high homology with the prokaryotic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> reducing enzyme <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show here that ADF and 3B6-derived IL-1 are identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> blot, 3B6 and ATL-2 cells were shown to contain high levels of 0.6-kilobase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> corresponding to ADF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such message was not detected in resting peripheral blood lymphocytes but could be weakly induced by lymphocyte activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antibodies have been raised against synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> corresponding to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi> terminus and the COOH terminus of ADF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting and sequential immunoprecipitation with these antibodies revealed the same 13-kDa protein in 3B6 and ATL-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recombinant ADF could sustain growth of 3B6 and ATL-2 cells at low cellular concentration without fetal calf serum; ADF, thus, appears involved in their autocrine growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, recombinant ADF could enhance growth of other B-cell lines, including the Epstein-Barr virus-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line BL41 and the lymphoblastoid cell lines CRAG8, CRB95, and 1G8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, recombinant ADF exhibits marked synergism with other cytokines, such as IL-1 and IL-2, allowing virally infected lymphocytes to respond to suboptimal amounts of a variety of growth factors </plain></SENT>
