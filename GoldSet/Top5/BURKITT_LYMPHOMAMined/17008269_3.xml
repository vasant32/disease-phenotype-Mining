<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The United Kingdom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Childhood Cancer</z:e> Study (UKCCS) is a national multi-centre case-control study that was designed to evaluate the potential aetiological role of prenatal events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The obstetric records of 2692 mothers of children diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and 4864 mothers of children without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, 1754 (65%) case mothers and 3220 (66%) control mothers had at least one prior pregnancy before the birth of the index child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 12 (0.68%) of the former and 9 (0.28%) of the latter had a prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020217" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="HYDM">molar pregnancy</z:e> (odds ratio 2.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1 - 6.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020217" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="HYDM">molar pregnancy</z:e> are rare neoplastic events, and the numbers are small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, whilst the associations were strongest for common precursor B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.9 - 14.7) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> (OR 6.2, 95% CI 1.3 - 30.3), the spread across the remaining diagnostic groups suggests that the relationship, if confirmed, may be of a generalized, rather than specific, type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first time that an association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_456'>hydatidiform mole</z:mpath> has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The UKCCS's systematic use of clinical records permitted a more precise characterization of reproductive events than is possible in investigations that rely on individuals own accounts, and we are confident that our findings cannot be explained by recall bias or other methodological limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we suggest that there may be an aetiologic connection between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020217" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="HYDM">molar pregnancy</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e>, and speculate here on the various genetic/epigenetic mechanisms that could be involved </plain></SENT>
