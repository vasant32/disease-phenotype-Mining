<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is generally expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and is therefore an interesting target for immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, evidence for the recognition and elimination of EBV-transformed and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for endogenously presented EBNA1-derived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We confirm here that CTLs specific for the HLA-B35/B53-presented EBNA1-derived HPVGEADYFEY (HPV) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> are detectable in the majority of HLA-B35 individuals, and recognize EBV-transformed B lymphocytes, thereby demonstrating that the GAr domain does not fully inhibit the class I presentation of the HPV <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells are not recognized by HPV-specific CTLs, suggesting that other mechanisms contribute to providing a full protection from EBNA1-specific CTL-mediated lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the major differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells and lymphoplastoid cell lines (LCLs) is the proteasome; indeed, proteasomes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells demonstrate far lower chymotryptic and tryptic-like activities compared with proteasomes from LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence, inefficient proteasomal processing is likely to be the main reason for the poor presentation of this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we show that treatments with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitors</z:chebi> partially restore the capacity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells to present the HPV <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This indicates that proteasomes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, although less efficient in degrading reference substrates than proteasomes from LCLs, are able to destroy the HPV <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>, which can, however, be generated and presented after partial inhibition of the proteasome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitors</z:chebi>, alone or in combination with other drugs, as a strategy for the treatment of EBNA1-carrying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
