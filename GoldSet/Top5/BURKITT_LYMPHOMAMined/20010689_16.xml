<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, such as human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, often contain translocations that link c-myc or other proto-oncogenes to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IgH, encoded by Igh) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nature of elements that activate oncogenes within such translocations has been a long-standing question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Translocations within Igh involve DNA double-strand breaks initiated either by the RAG1/2 endonuclease during variable, diversity and joining gene segment (V(D)J) recombination, or by activation-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase (AID, also known as AICDA) during class switch recombination (CSR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>V(D)J recombination in progenitor B (pro-B) cells assembles Igh variable region exons upstream of mu constant region (Cmu) exons, which are the first of several sets of C(H) exons ('C(H) genes') within a C(H) locus that span several hundred kilobases (kb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In mature B cells, CSR deletes Cmu and replaces it with a downstream C(H) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An intronic enhancer (iEmu) between the variable region exons and Cmu promotes V(D)J recombination in developing B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the Igh 3' regulatory region (Igh3'RR) lies downstream of the C(H) locus and modulates CSR by long-range transcriptional enhancement of C(H) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice bearing iEmu or Igh3'RR sequences fused to c-myc are predisposed to B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, demonstrating that such elements can confer oncogenic c-myc expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in many B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, Igh-c-myc translocations delete iEmu and place c-myc up to 200 kb upstream of the Igh3'RR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Here we address the oncogenic role of the Igh3'RR by inactivating it in two distinct mouse models for B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with Igh-c-myc translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We show that the Igh3'RR is dispensable for pro-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with V(D)J recombination-initiated translocations, but is required for peripheral B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with CSR-associated translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As the Igh3'RR is not required for CSR-associated Igh breaks or Igh-c-myc translocations in peripheral B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> progenitors, we conclude that this regulatory region confers oncogenic activity by long-range and developmental stage-specific activation of translocated c-myc genes </plain></SENT>
