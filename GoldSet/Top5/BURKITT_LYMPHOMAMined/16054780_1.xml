<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that when infected by Mycoplasma fermentans, human B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell proliferation increased strongly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These infected B cells expressed a p45 kDa protein which interacted with the intracellular domain of CD21, the EBV/C3d receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p45 analysis demonstrated that this is a new gene which encodes an elongation factor originating from Mycoplasma fermentans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p45 interaction with CD21 was specific, there being no interaction with CD19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration that Mycoplasma fermentans, in infecting human B cells, generates a p45 Mycoplasma component that interacts with CD21, which is involved in B cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
