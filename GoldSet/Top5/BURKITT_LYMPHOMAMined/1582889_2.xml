<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> and human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have been shown to carry a chromosomal translocation involving c-myc and immunoglobulin genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study genetic or epigenetic factors that affect myc-induced lymphoid cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, we previously introduced the Emu-myc delta gene lacking its own promoter and first exon into two inbred strains of mice, C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed three characteristic features in our transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> predominated in the C3H background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, both pre-B and B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> developed at equal frequency in C57BL/6 transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Third, the average <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> is earlier than that reported by other investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To test whether these characteristics are due either to the lack of the promoter region and first exon of the c-myc gene in the construct or to the genetic background of the mice, we introduced Emu-myc gene containing the complete c-myc gene into fertilized eggs of C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cell-type specificity, differentiation-stage specificity and the average age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> development were not affected by the transgene construct </plain></SENT>
