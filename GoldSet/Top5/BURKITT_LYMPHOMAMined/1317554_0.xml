<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histology as well as EBV-related serology are not diagnostic, but demonstration of EBV DNA in LPS suspected lesions might be useful for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied four autopsied cases of LPS that developed in the setting of bone marrow transplantation, with proliferations ranging from poly- to monoclonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our protocol of DNA extraction allowed detection of EBV DNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In dot blot hybridization the sensitivity in these specimens was 10% as compared to fresh frozen material, but still sufficient for a biotinylated probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Southern blotting with the former DNA was not successful due to extensive degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization resulted in positive signals in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, using either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi> or 3H labeled probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The labeling pattern suggested virus replication in B cells of LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By this, LPS resembles productively infected lymphoblastoid cell lines rather than latently EBV-infected Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings strengthen the concept of LPS as a distinct clinicopathologic entity, differing from monoclonal, latently EBV-infected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, as well as from polyclonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e>, and the more common EBV-negative Non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the immunocompetent host </plain></SENT>
