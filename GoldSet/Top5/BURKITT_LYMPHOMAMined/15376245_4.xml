<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(2003): Bioelectromagnetics 24:148-158] and 24 h later, to determine the post-exposure effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were found to depend on the medium, pH value, conductivity, and temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From these experiments, suitable conditions were chosen to compare the vitality between K-562 cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human lymphocytes after PEMF treatment and photodynamic action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both agents enhance <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> synergistically for diseased as well as for healthy cells, but the lymphocytes are more resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of PEMF on the destruction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells is further increased by heating (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>) of the suspension up to 44 degrees C or by lowering the pH-value (hyperacidity) to pH 6.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> can be obtained using moderate magnetic fields (B &lt; or = 15 mT 50/60 Hz), but this requires longer treatment of at least over a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PEMF application combined with anticancer drugs and photodynamic therapy will be very effective </plain></SENT>
