<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis of Burkitt s <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> patients seen over eleven year period, between January 1987 to December 1997 at the Paediatrics and Haematology Departments of the University College Hospital, Ibadan was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 67 patients, mean age 11+5 years (range 4 to 30 years), 42 males, 25 female giving M:F ratio of 1.7:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Majority of the patients (76.2%) were stage D, only 4.5% were stages A and of the 67 patients, only 57 (83.6%) had chemotherapy, 40 of whom had COAP, 8 had COMP and 9 patients had either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> or cytosar as monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 22.8% of patients that received chemotherapy went into complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we observed a declining overall complete remission rate of 22.8% (compared to 47% in 1979) in Burkitt s <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of large amount of fake drugs in the Nigerian market may imply that some of the cytotoxic drugs used in these patients could have been fake drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the government should subsidize the therapy of these patients as well as eradicate the presence of fake drugs in the market, thereby increasing the chances of a cure </plain></SENT>
