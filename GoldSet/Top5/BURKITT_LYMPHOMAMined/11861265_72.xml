<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this prospective study, samples from 478 patients with CD10(+) B-cell precursor ALL (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">c-ALL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e>) underwent BCR-ABL reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis with double testing of positive samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified according to the PCR result and treated in 2 German Multicenter Trials of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Adult ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcome was followed and the prognostic impact of BCR-ABL was compared to clinical risk features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 478 samples, 432 had an evaluable BCR-ABL result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven percent of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">c-ALL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> patients were BCR-ABL(+) (p190, 77%; p210, 20%; simultaneous p190/p210, 3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BCR-ABL positivity was associated with the high-risk features of older age (45 years versus 30 years median age; P =.0001) and higher white blood cell counts (23 500/microL versus 11 550/microL; P =.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed BCR-ABL as the leading factor for a poor prognosis (P =.0001) in comparison to clinical risk criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Irrespective of the breakpoint, presence of any BCR-ABL transcript predicted a lower chance of initial treatment response (68.4% versus 84.6%; P =.001) and a lower probability of disease-free survival at 3 years (0.13 versus 0.47; P =.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This bad outcome was not influenced by postinduction high-dose treatment stratifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results show a high prevalence of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts with predominance of p190 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BCR-ABL RT-PCR is confirmed as a sensitive, rapid method to diagnose t(9;22), and p190 and p210 are unequivocally demonstrated as the most important predictors of poor long-term survival despite intensified chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
