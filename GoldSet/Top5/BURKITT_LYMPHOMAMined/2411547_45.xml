<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A lambda gt10 cDNA library of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from IFN-induced Daudi lymphoblastoid cells was screened with oligonucleotide probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several overlapping cDNAs were isolated and shown to be derived from the human synthetase gene using filter selection and oocyte microinjection assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide sequence of one of these, cDNA 8-2, extended the 2-5A synthetase sequence already described 72 bp in the 5' direction but was found to differ significantly in coding sequence at the 3' end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The longest cDNA isolated (6-2) was approximately 1.4 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By Northern hybridization analysis single <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> of 1.7 kb were detected in Daudi and T98G (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in HeLa cells, four <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> ranging in size from 1.5 to 3.5 kb were found, one of which differed at the 3' end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of both phage and cosmid genomic clones and comparison with genomic DNA indicate that there is a single gene for 2-5A synthetase, comprising at least six exons and five introns, which can undergo a novel form of alternative <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> processing depending on cell type </plain></SENT>
