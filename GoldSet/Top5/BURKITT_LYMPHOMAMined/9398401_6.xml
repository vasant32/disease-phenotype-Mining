<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expansion or elimination of a B cell clone is determined through a complex interaction of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor/nerve growth factor receptor family members CD40 and Fas, which are expressed on the B cell surface, with their respective physiological ligands (CD40L and FasL) expressed on the surface of CD4+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The regulation of B cell growth by signals transduced through CD40 and Fas contributes to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance and likely takes place and in the germinal centres (GC) of secondary lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigate the relationship between the expression of Fas and B cell survival following engagement of CD40 and Fas in the Epstein-Barr virus-genome-negative Ramos-Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) B cell line model of GC B lymphocyte selection during maturation of the humoral immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We now present evidence that Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells constitutively express both Fas and FasL on their surface and that expression of Fas, but not FasL, is enhanced following ligation of CD40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coligation of CD40 and Fas, triggers for growth inhibition, activation of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme, now caspase, family member CPP32 (caspase-3) but not Ich-1L (caspase-2), cleavage of its <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> substrate poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> from the G1 phase of cell cycle; engagement of Fas alone fails to trigger for growth inhibition and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> but enhances AgR-mediated cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
