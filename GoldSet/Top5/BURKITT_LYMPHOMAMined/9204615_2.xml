<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only untreated patients with standard risk were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from 1.8-10 years with a mean of 5.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 82 (68%) children with early pre B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>, 35 (29%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre B-ALL</z:e> and 2(1.6%) with transitional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre B-ALL</z:e> (p &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided according to CD10 reactivity, either + (94 children) or -(25 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The event-free survival (EFS) at 60 months for the CD10+ children was of 78% (alive 73/94), while for the CD10- was 71% (alive 18/25) (p = 0.6) and 74% for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The factors that influenced favorably the survival in the CD10+ group were the age between 3 to 5.99 years (p &lt; 0.00001), sex (either male or female), leukocyte count between 10-24.9 x 10(9)/l (p &lt; 0.00001), LDH under 300 U/I (p &lt; 0.00001) and L1 bone marrow cytomorphology (p &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the CD10- patients, the EFS was favorably influenced by the female sex (p = 0.04), leukocyte count under 10 x 10(9)/l (p = 0.05) and LDH &lt; 300 U/l (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> infiltration was documented in 4.2% (5/119) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality secondary to chemotherapy was seen in 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this is the first large series in Mexican children with B-lineage ALL published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because of the relatively small number of patients in each group (pre B and transitional pre B), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients in the current series were treated alike </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When the 119 patients were divided only on the basis of CD10 reactivity, the EFS for both groups (CD10+ and-) was similar; therefore, the reactivity to CD10 has no prognostic value in this type of ALL </plain></SENT>
