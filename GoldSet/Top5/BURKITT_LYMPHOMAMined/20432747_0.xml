<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of specific entities of B-NHL is based on well-defined morphologic analysis, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics and molecular genetics, which determine the optimal treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In adult population a major turning point in treatment of B-NHL has been achieved since rituximab, in combination with CHOP has improved the survival rate up to 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets CD20, a transmembrane calcium channel expressed on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant B-cells that mediates cytotoxic, apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of rituximab in pediatric population is still not well enough investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotype of malignant cells, seven children with B-NHL in our institution were eligible for treatment with modified B-NHL-Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster (BFM)-95-based protocol with rituximab administered on day -5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The complete remission was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients are still in complete remission at least 12 months after having finished chemotherapy and one patient relapsed two months after the last cycle and subsequently died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major adverse effects observed during treatment were prolonged B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rituximab in combination with B-NHL-BFM-95 protocol was otherwise well tolerated and proved to be effective in children and adolescents with B-NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of our patients is too small and the follow-up of a larger group of patients will help in defining the role of rituximab in the treatment of childhood B-NHL </plain></SENT>
