<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Kutapressin (KU), a porcine liver extract with bradykinin-potentiating effects but no <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B 12</z:chebi> activity, has been used in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">Herpes zoster</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined a <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>-free preparation of this drug for in vitro activity against Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immortalization-inhibition assays were used to assess EBV infectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">Mitogen</z:chebi> stimulation and cell viability assays were used to assess kutapression toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lytic replication assays and flow cytometry were used to assess the mechanism of drug activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-five hundred mcg/ml of KU blocked the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of 2 x 10(5) human umbilical cord mononuclear cells when added together with two strains of EBV (B95-8 and FF41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Doses as low as 250 mcg/ml were occasionally effective as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi>, KU does not inhibit <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA polymerase nor does it appear to compete with EBV as it binds to its receptor on the B-cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism whereby KU may inhibit EBV immortalization remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>KU, a drug which is safe in humans, deserves further study as an agent with potential to block EBV-induced immortalization of B-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
