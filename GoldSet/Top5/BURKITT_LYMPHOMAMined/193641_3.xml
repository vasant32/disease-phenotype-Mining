<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Successful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> of D98/HR-1 cells with EBV was made evident by the expression of early antigen and, to a lesser extent, virus capsid antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only a rare D98/Raji cell was found to be positive for early antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histocompatibility antigens of the parental cell lines D98, HR-1, and Raji were expressed on the surfaces of the hybrid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receptors for third complement components b and d were not detected on the hybrid cells or on the D98P OR HR-1 cell lines; they were found, however, on the Raji cells, indicating that EBV receptors and complement receptors can be separated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significance of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of the hybrid cells with EBV and the expression of cell surface markers is described </plain></SENT>
