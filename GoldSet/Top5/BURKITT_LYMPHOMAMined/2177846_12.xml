<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We designed synthetic oligonucleotide primers and hybridization probe for use in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and hybridization detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nucleic acid sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primer sequences were chosen from the coding region for the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PCR amplification and hybridization with these oligonucleotides was carried out on standard laboratory cell lines including African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> derived cell lines, as well as cell lines recently established from clinical EBV isolates from bone marrow transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> EBV cell lines tested were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No false-positives were detected with uninfected cell lines, human placental DNA or with other viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the detection procedure was such that four copies of the EBV genome could consistently be detected in a background of 1 microgram of placental DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBV was detected in DNA extracts from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> and one patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>-associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_654'>hemophagocytic syndrome</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of 18 EBV seropositive patients without known ongoing EBV-associated illness undergoing ambulatory surgery also had EBV detected in DNA extracts from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EBV was detected in DNA extracts from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue from two patients with post-transplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients with primary <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EBV was not detected in 12 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimens from patients without history of immunocompromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DNA extracts from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded Hodgkin's tissues previously shown to be EBV positive by Southern blot were also demonstrated to be EBV positive by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, with the oligonucleotides described, PCR is applicable to the detection of EBV in a spectrum of clinical isolates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The broad specificity of these oligonucleotides for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> strains of EBV tested is probably a function of the highly conserved sequence of the EBNA-1 DNA binding domain </plain></SENT>
