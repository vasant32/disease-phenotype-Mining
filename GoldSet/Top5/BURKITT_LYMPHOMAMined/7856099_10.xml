<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incoming EBV entered its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> program of gene expression, producing EBNA-2 and LMP-1 and activating the Cp EBNA promoter, but the endogenous virus in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines was not induced to express EBNA-2 or transcribe <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from Cp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LMP-1 was, however, expressed from the endogenous genome in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a proportion of the superinfected Akata cells, the productive cycle antigen BZLF1 was induced and the ability of infecting virus to cause this was sensitive to inactivation by uv light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results show that the restricted latent pattern of EBV gene expression observed in Group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells is not a consequence of lack of appropriate transcription factor activity but results from inactivation of part of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome, probably by methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction of BZLF1 in some of the cells also indicates a novel pathway for activation of the virus productive cycle </plain></SENT>
