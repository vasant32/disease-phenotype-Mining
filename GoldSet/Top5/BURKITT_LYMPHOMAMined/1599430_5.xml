<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activated tyrosine kinase subsequently phosphorylates a number of substrates, including phospholipase C-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This enzyme breaks down phosphoinositol bisphosphate to form two intracellular messengers, diacylglycerol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> 1,4,5-trisphosphate, leading to the activation of protein kinase C and the release of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have used h.p.l.c. and flow cytometry to measure accurately the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24846">inositol phosphate</z:chebi> turnover and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release in anti-Ig-stimulated human B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, we have examined the effect of dose of the cross-linking antibody on the two responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The identity of putative messenger <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24846">inositol phosphates</z:chebi> has been verified by structural analysis, and the amounts of both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24846">inositol phosphates</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> present have been quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the Ramos Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which is very sensitive to stimulus through its Ig receptors, both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24846">inositol phosphate</z:chebi> production and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release were found to be related to the dose of anti-Ig antibody applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that phospholipase C-mediated signal transduction in human B cells converts the degree of cross-linking of the immunoglobulin receptor quantitatively into intracellular signals </plain></SENT>
