<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not currently known how the temporary immobilization of B cells in distinct areas of this complex microenvironment is regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed at defining B cell antigens that initiate binding of B cells to human tonsil sections in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Engaging the B cell antigens CD19 and target of an antiproliferative antibody 1 (TAPA-1) with monoclonal antibodies induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of these B cells to the interfollicular stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This binding occurred through the integrin alpha 4 beta 1 on the B cell surface and via the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin expressed in the interfollicular compartment of the tonsil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Signaling through either antigen, CD19 or TAPA-1, depended on tyrosine kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binding induced by engaging CD19 required an intact cytoskeleton, whereas TAPA-1-transmitted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that CD19 and TAPA-1 have a novel and unique function by regulating an alpha 4 beta 1/fibronectin-mediated binding of B cells to the interfollicular stroma of lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
