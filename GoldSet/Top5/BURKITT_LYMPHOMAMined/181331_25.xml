<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty American patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) were studied serologically and biochemically to detect an association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A wide range of antibody reactivities was encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients had serological profiles similar to those of African patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>: one and possibly two of these patients harbored EBV-DNA in their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had low or absent antibody to EBV: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from 10 of these patients lacked evidence of EBV-DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An unexplained association between elevated antibody (greater than or equal to 1:80) to EBV virus capsid antigen (VCA) and a favorable prognosis was noted in this series; this prognostic observation requires further substantiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, it appears that EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> is inversely proportional to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> endemicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An etiological role for EBV in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> remains speculative </plain></SENT>
