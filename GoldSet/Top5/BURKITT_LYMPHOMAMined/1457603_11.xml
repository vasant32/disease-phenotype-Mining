<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the patterns of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> in the intestinal crypts of mice and in a human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line were investigated by light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">Vincristine</z:chebi> was found to enhance <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of interphase cells in both systems and also to cause the arrest of cells in mitosis, the latter effect being more pronounced in the intestinal crypts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arrested mitotic cells went on to die by a process that had a number of features in common with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These include compaction of chromatin (following coalescence of chromosomes), condensation of the cytoplasm, initial preservation of organelle integrity, and eventually the fragmentation of the cell into a number of membrane-enclosed bodies which are morphologically similar to conventional apoptotic bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the cytocidal effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> is not solely dependent on metaphase arrest but is a cumulative one, resulting both from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of interphase cells and the 'apoptotic-like' <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of cells arrested in metaphase </plain></SENT>
