<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 120-kDa membrane-associated form is a phosphorylated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, which is derived from a non-phosphorylated intracellular 84-kDa <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoprotein</z:chebi> that is co-translationally N-glycosylated with a carbohydrate portion of 6 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other form of the Ki-1 antigen is a non-glycosylated phosphoprotein of 57 kDa which only occurs intracellularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both forms of the antigen are phosphorylated at serine residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enzymatic cleavage with sialidase reduced the 120-kDa membrane antigen by about 15 kDa, while its 90-kDa precursor and the 57-kDa intracellular form of the Ki-1 antigen remained unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the 57-kDa and 90/120-kDa molecules are synthesized independently of each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four to eight hours after synthesis, the degradation of the 120-kDa molecule to a 105-kDa membrane-associated intermediate begins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is further processed and appears in the cell supernate as a 90-kDa molecule </plain></SENT>
