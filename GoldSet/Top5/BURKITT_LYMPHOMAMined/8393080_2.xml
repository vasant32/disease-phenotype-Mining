<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analysed the expression of transformation-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigens, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA content and the phenotypic characteristics of two B95-8 virus-converted sublines of the EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) line BL28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The converted lines called E95A-BL28 and E95B-BL28, respectively, differed in their EBV gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The E95B convertant expressed virus-encoded nuclear antigens EBNA1 to -6 and the membrane protein LMP1, but only EBNA2 and EBNA5 were detected by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting in the E95A convertant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only the entire BamHI W, Y and H regions could be detected in the E95A convertant by hybridization of Southern blots with probes covering the BamHI C, W, Y, H, F, E, K and Nhet regions of the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBV episomes were found to be absent in the E95A convertant as seen by Gardella gels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The E95A convertant retained the phenotypic characteristics of the EBV-negative parental line, and remained highly clonable in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, expression of EBNA1 to -6 and LMP1 was accompanied by a shift towards a more lymphoblastoid cell line-like phenotype and by loss of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> clonability in the E95B convertant </plain></SENT>
