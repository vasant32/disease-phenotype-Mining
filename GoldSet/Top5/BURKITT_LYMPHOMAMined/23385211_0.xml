<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The target molecules were found to be potent inhibitors of cellular viability while inducing cell type specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> mechanisms in three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines including a highly chemoresistant Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basic <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> analogues were found to be important for increased potency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47499">Imipramine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47781">desipramine</z:chebi> were also tested for apoptotic activity and were found to be much less active than the novel dimeric compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47499">Imipramine</z:chebi> dimers were only found to be moderate inhibitors of the human <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> transporter (hSERT) having IC(50) values in the micromolar region whilst the induction of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred independently of hSERT expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the potential of newly designed and synthesised <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47499">imipramines</z:chebi> derivatives for use against malignant cells, including those resistant to standard chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
