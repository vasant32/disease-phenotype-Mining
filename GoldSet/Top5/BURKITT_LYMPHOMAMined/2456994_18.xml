<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The specificity of IgM and IgG1 MAbs was characterized by binding to defined <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> and glycoconjugates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antibodies that bound equally well to P1 and Pk determinants and to <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-O-derivatives were obtained, together with others that showed selective recognition of the entire <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27150">trisaccharide</z:chebi> chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selected antibodies were shown to be useful as reagents for detection of the blood group P antigens in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> extracts of erythrocytes and on the surface of erythrocytes of different P phenotypes, demonstrated both by radioimmune assays and hemagglutination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six IgM MAbs directed to the Pk determinant bound selectively to Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and 2 of these antibodies (424/3D9 and 424/6A2) could be used as auxiliary reagents in immunofluorescence for diagnosis and classification of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> using flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and 37 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells of 2/2 patients with "Burkitt-like" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> were strongly stained for the Pk antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The staining patterns for differentiation markers classified the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells to a developmental stage closely related to the Burkitt cell type </plain></SENT>
