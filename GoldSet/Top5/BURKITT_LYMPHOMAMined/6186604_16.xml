<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Daudi cell line is characterized by an absence of HLA antigen on its surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has been attributed to a lack of beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) while the heavy chain of HLA is present intracellularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Karyotype analysis of Daudi cells has shown a deletion involving one of the beta 2-microglobulin alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was generally believed that the absence of beta 2-microglobulin in that cell line resulted from an absence of expression of the remaining gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here the unexpected finding of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> amount of beta 2-microglobulin <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> in Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was demonstrated by "Northern blot" hybridization with cDNA plasmid clones as a probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, however, when purified by hybridization-selection with beta 2-microglobulin plasmid DNA, is unable to function as messenger in protein synthesis and is therefore an inactive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding of a translationally inactive beta 2-microglobulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> provides a new explanation for the absence of beta 2-microglobulin and therefore of HLA antigens in Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
