<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (eBL) is characterized by the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and a chromosomal translocation which results in deregulation and constitutive expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to examine the role played by activation of c-myc in determining the eBL phenotype, we have introduced into EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cells (LCL) plasmids which permit constitutive expression of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The resulting cells show a reduced serum dependence, reduced homotypic cell aggregation, and changes in surface characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, levels of the cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule, LFA-I, are greatly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the cells continue to express <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the EBV latent antigens associated with the LCL phenotype and they remain nontumorigenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that, whilst constitutive expression of c-myc may contribute to the malignant phenotype, it is insufficient to induce tumorigenicity </plain></SENT>
