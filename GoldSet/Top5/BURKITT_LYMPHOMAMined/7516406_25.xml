<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD77 is also a marker for germinal center B lymphocytes and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pan B cell marker CD19 is a 95-kD membrane protein that appears early in B cell differentiation and is only lost upon terminal differentiation to plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD19 is involved in signal transduction and has a regulatory role in B cell proliferation and differentiation in response to activation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, an endogenous ligand for CD19 has not yet been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report herein that the extracellular domain of CD19 has a potential CD77-binding site with extensive sequence similarity to the verotoxin B-subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These B-subunit-like sequences on CD19 are in close proximity following the organization of intervening amino acids into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-linked domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cocapping of CD19 and CD77 on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived Daudi cells with anti-CD19 antibodies indicates that CD19 and CD77 are associated on the B cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cell surface binding of anti-CD19 antibodies is decreased on CD77-deficient mutant Daudi cells, suggesting that CD77 expression influences the surface expression of CD19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> Daudi cells, but not the CD19/CD77-deficient mutants, bind to matrices expressing the carbohydrate moiety of CD77 or other <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 1-4Gal containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This binding can be inhibited by anti-CD77 antibodies, the CD77-binding verotoxin B-subunit or anti-CD19 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Daudi cells exhibit a degree of spontaneous homotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> in culture while the CD77/CD19-deficient Daudi mutants grow as single cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The stronger homotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> that occurs in B cells after antibody ligation of CD19 and that involves, to some extent, the integrin system, is also dramatically lower in the mutant cells relative to the parent cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, reconstitution of mutant cells with CD77 restores the anti-CD19 mAb-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Daudi cell levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These studies represent the first time that CD19-mediated signaling has been reconstituted in a low-responder B cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These convergent observations provide compelling evidence that CD19/CD77 interactions function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and signal transduction at a specific stage in B cell development and suggest that such interactions have a role in B lymphocyte homing and germinal center formation in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>By targeting CD77+ B cells, verotoxins may suppress the humoral arm of the immune response during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
