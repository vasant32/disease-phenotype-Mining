<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both had a CCND1/IGH and an MYC rearrangement by cytogenetics and FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotype was CD5+[one was a weak positive], CD10+, CD20+, CCND1+, &gt;90% Ki-67 proliferation fraction and CD23 negative </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cases, along with the reported cases, distinguish an aggressive category of a blastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> with a poor prognosis that probably requires Burkitt therapy </plain></SENT>
