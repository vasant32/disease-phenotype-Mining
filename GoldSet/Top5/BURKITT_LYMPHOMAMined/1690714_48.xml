<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before the class II heterodimer appears on the cell surface, the invariant chain dissociates but it has so far been unclear as to whether or not a proportion of the invariant chain also appears on the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a study with three monoclonal antibodies which recognize an extracytoplasmic determinant present on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> forms of the invariant chain and use them to demonstrate its presence on the surface of the intact cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The determinants recognized by two of the antibodies were found to be located within the 60 amino acids at the extreme C-terminal (extracytoplasmic) end of the invariant chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The invariant chain-specific monoclonal antibody, VIC-Y1, was found to bind a determinant located between amino acids 1 and 73, which correspond to mainly cytoplasmic residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the C-terminal specific antibodies, the number of antibody binding sites on the surface of two B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines was estimated to be 10(5) per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of this study appear to resolve the highly disputed question of whether or not the invariant chain can appear as a plasma membrane protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results are discussed in the context of a possible role for the invariant chain in antigen processing and presentation </plain></SENT>
