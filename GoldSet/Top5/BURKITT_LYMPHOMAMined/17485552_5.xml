<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) is a B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> whose characteristic gene aberration is the translocation t(8;14), which determines c-myc overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several genetic and epigenetic alterations other than c-myc overexpression have also been described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that the RBL2/p130 gene, a member of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> family (pRbs), is mutated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the biologic effect of RBL2/p130 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells and its possible role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we reintroduced a functional RBL2/p130 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines where this gene was mutated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that RBL2/p130-transfected cells regain growth control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that RBL2/p130 may control the expression of several genes, which may be important for cell growth and viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gene-expression analysis revealed a modulation of several genes, including CGRRF1, RGS1, BTG1, TIA1, and PCDHA2, upon RBL2/p130 reintroduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We then monitored their expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> of endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> as well, demonstrating that their expression resembled those of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these data suggest that, as RBL2/p130 modulates the expression of target genes, which are important for cell growth and viability, its inactivation may be relevant for the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
