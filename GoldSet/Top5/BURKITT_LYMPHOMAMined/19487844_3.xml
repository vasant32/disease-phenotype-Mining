<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this retrospective study is to present a spectrum of FDG PET findings at initial presentation of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and subsequent findings after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed 48 patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> referred for a total of 160 FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) scans at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We characterized the disease distribution of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and measured representative FDG activity from initial staging scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic response and disease remission were assessed in patients with PET/CT and clinical follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 48 patients diagnosed with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 25 patients had FDG PET/CT scans for initial staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> untreated lesions of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were highly FDG <z:chebi fb="156" ids="39214">avid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean maximum standardized uptake value of 54 representative lesions is 16.5 (range: 6-54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were immune compromised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients had disease localized to the abdomen and the pelvis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Extranodal involvement was identified in more than half of the patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The American (or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>) form of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> presented with intense hypermetabolic lesions when untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The information is useful in evaluating post-treatment studies in the absence of a pretreatment scan </plain></SENT>
