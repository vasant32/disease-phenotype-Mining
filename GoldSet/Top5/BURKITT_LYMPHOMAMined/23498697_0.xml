<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we described a new recognition probe possessing two parts, the ATP aptamer and the extension part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recognition probe was firstly immobilized on the surface of MBs and hybridized with its complementary sequence to form a duplex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When combined with ATP, the probe changed its conformation, revealing the extension part in single-strand form, which further served as a toehold for subsequent target recycling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The released complementary sequence of the probe acted as the catalyst of the MB-assisted strand displacement reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incorporated with target recycling, a large amount of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-tagged MB complexes were formed to stimulate the generation of chemiluminescence (CL) signal in the presence of luminol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> by incorporating with streptavidin-HRP, reaching a detection limit of ATP as low as 6.1Ã—10(-10)M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, sample assays of ATP in Ramos Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cells were performed, which confirmed the reliability and practicality of the protocol </plain></SENT>
