<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human bcl-2 gene is a oncogene candidate which is involved in the t(14;18) translocation specifically associated with follicular and diffuse B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This translocation deregulates bcl-2 gene expression by placing it into immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IgH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL 1446) carrying a unique bcl-2 gene rearrangement with the immunoglobulin lambda light chain (Ig lambda) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This juxtaposition of the bcl-2 and Ig lambda genes resembles a variant chromosome translocation in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, although karyotype data of CLL 1446 is not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we completed the structural analysis of the bcl-2/Ig lambda gene rearrangement in CLL 1446 by cloning the corresponding partner of the rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This revealed that the juxtaposition of the bcl-2 and Ig lambda genes is a result of a reciprocal chromosome translocation between chromosomes 18 and 22 with deletions of 2 and 15 bp, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although a conserved immunoglobulin recombination signal (7mer-9mer) was absent around the breakpoint on chromosome 18, nonamer-like sequence was recognized within the deleted region at the breakpoint on chromosome 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No extranucleotide was associated with both joining sites of the t(18;22) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is in sharp contrast to the t(14;18) translocation involving IgH locus in which the presence of extranucleotides is common and correlates well with the presence and absence of extranucleotides on V-(D)-J joining of IgH and light chain (L) genes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data together suggest that the mechanism responsible for the physiological rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes is involved in this translocation </plain></SENT>
