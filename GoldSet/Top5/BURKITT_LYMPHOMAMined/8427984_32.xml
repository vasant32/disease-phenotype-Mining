<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured levels of bcl-2 protein in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and leukemic human B-cell progenitors with a specific monoclonal antibody and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> immature B cells had low levels of bcl-2 protein; the intensity of fluorescence, expressed as molecules of soluble <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51217">fluorochrome</z:chebi> per cell, within CD10+ cells was 3,460 +/- 1,050 (mean +/- SD; 5 samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 16 cases of B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), cells had levels of bcl-2 that were strikingly higher than those of their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts (33,560 +/- 14,570; P &lt; .001 by t-test analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We next investigated whether the intensity of bcl-2 expression correlated with the resistance of immature B cells to in vitro culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 12 cases of B-lineage ALL, the cells recovered after 7 days of culture on allogeneic bone marrow stromal layers were 69% to 178% (median, 95.5%) of those originally seeded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prolonged survival of leukemic cells in vitro was observed even in the absence of stromal layers in 6 of these 12 cases; the intensity of bcl-2 protein expression in these cases was 45,000 +/- 13,270, compared with 21,500 +/- 7,260 in the 6 cases in which greater than 99.5% of cells rapidly died by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> under the same culture conditions (P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five immature B-cell lines, continuously growing in the absence of stroma, had the highest bcl-2 expression (79,400 +/- 20,330) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, most <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD19+, sIg-immature B cells died despite the presence of bone marrow stromal layers; 9.7% to 28.2% were recovered after 7 days of culture in three experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that abnormal bcl-2 gene expression influences the survival ability of B-cell progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> and explain the aptitude of leukemic lymphoblasts to expand outside the bone marrow microenvironment </plain></SENT>
