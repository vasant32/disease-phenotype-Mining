<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial studies confirmed the observation that cell lines representative of immature B cells, i.e., Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, were induced to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to ionomycin, whereas more mature B cell lines did not, and instead underwent cell cycle arrest in the G1 interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand this differential outcome, we have focused on comparing the expression and activation of an endonuclease(s) in cells induced by ionomycin to undergo programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (Ramos) with cells resistant to ionomycin-induced programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (Ly1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that a low m.w. fraction of an endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/Mg(2+)-dependent endonuclease was activated in Ramos cells, but not in activated Ly1 cells, following the addition of ionomycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of interest, however, low m.w. endogenous endonuclease(s) activity was induced when isolated Ly1 cell nuclei were treated with exogenous calcium instead </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, these data support the conclusion that ionomycin-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> involves the activation of a latent, low m.w., calcium-responsive endonuclease and suggest that control of endonuclease <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> may contribute to cell-specific regulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
