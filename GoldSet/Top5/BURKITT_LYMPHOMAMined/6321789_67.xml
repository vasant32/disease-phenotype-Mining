<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By cloning the HR-1 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line, we previously uncovered two distinct biological variants of nontransforming Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most commonly cloned variant has a low rate of spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> synthesis and is unable to induce early antigen in Raji cells (EAI-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A rare variant spontaneously releases virus which is capable of inducing early antigen in Raji cells (EAI+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since EAI- virus lacks <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> DNA (het-) and EAI+ virus contains <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> DNA (het+), we suggested that spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> synthesis and induction of early antigen are biological properties which correlate with the presence of het sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present experiments provide three new lines of experimental evidence in favor of this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(i) <z:mp ids='MP_0003171'>Revertant</z:mp> subclones of the EAI+ het+ variant which have lost the het DNA concomitantly lost EAI ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, het DNA is not stably associated with the cells as are the episomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(ii) het DNA was acquired by two het- subclones of the HR-1 line after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> with EAI+ virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e>, these clones synthesized EAI+ het+ virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, het DNA may be maintained in the HR-1 line by cell-to-cell spread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(iii) Virus with het DNA activated full expression of endogenous latent EBV of the transforming phenotype in a line of immortalized neonatal lymphocytes designated X50-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By use of restriction endonuclease polymorphisms unique to both the superinfecting and endogenous genomes, we show that the genome of the activated virus resembles that of the virus which was endogenous to X50-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that het sequences result in transactivation of the latent EBV. het DNA had homology with EBV sequences which are not normally contiguous on the physical map of the genome. het DNA was always accompanied by the presence of DNA of nonheterogenous HR-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, het DNA is a form of "defective" EBV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, the biological effect of this defective DNA is to enhance rather than to interfere with EBV replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This is a novel property of defective virus </plain></SENT>
