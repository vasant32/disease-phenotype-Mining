<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From Southern hybridization analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes in leukaemic blasts, the occurrence of a sizeable minority of patients displaying multiple (greater than two) rearranged heavy chain alleles has been widely reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In at least some patients these data are consistent with the presence of oligoclonal populations of precursor B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have used a more sensitive, polymerase chain reaction based immunoglobulin gene 'fingerprinting' approach in the analysis of B-cell clonality in eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> which were apparently monoclonal on the basis of Southern blot analysis of their IgH genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results revealed an oligoclonal pattern of IgH gene rearrangement in half of the patients analysed, implying that oligoclonality at the level of B-cell commitment, as defined by IgH gene rearrangement, is much more widespread in this disease than has previously been recognized </plain></SENT>
