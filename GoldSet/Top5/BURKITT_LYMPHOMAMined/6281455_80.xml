<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results confirmed that the most abundant cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> species in such cells is specified by a small region of the genome defined by the EcoRI J fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detailed mapping experiments precisely localized these transcripts within the sequence of the rightmost one-third of the EcoRI J fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing suggested that this region of the Epstein-Barr virus genome is unable to code for protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major early transcripts consisted of two non-polyadenylated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> species, each about 170 nucleotides in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were both transcribed off the same strand of the DNA and showed significant sequence homology with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The coding sequences of the two small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> contained potential intragenic control regions for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase III </plain></SENT>
