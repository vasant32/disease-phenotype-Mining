<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have cloned and sequenced the translocated c-myc gene from the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> CA46 cell line that carries a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 8 and 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint lies within the first intron of c-myc, so that the first noncoding exon of the gene remains on the 8q- chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second and third coding exons are translocated to the 14q+ chromosome into the switch region of C-alpha 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The orientation of the c-myc gene with relationship to alpha 1 is 5' to 5', with directions of transcription in opposite orientation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing studies predict five changes in the amino acid sequence of the myc protein, two of which occur in a region within the second exon which is highly conserved in evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Southern blotting data indicate that the first exon of c-myc is rearranged 3' to 3' with the pseudo-epsilon gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because CA46 cells contain two rearranged mu genes, the translocation must have occurred after immunoglobulin rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The position of the breakpoint in CA46 occurs within a 20-base-pair region of the first intron of c-myc to which breakpoints have been mapped for two additional B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with the t(8;14) translocation, ST486 and the Manca cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The region of the heavy chain locus to which c-myc has translocated is different in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparisons have been made of the levels of transcripts of the translocated c-myc gene in ST486 and CA46, where the gene is not associated with the heavy chain enhancer, with its expression in the Manca cell, in which it is </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The c-myc gene is transcribed at similar levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases </plain></SENT>
