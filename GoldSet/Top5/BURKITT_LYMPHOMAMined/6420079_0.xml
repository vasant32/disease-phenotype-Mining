<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) express several in vitro cytotoxic functions, among which are natural killer (NK), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (LDCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship of these various cytotoxic functions and the identity of cells involved has been a subject of controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently it was reported that NK and K for ADCC can be mediated by the same cell, suggesting that they constitute in large part a single subpopulation with multiple cytotoxic functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability of this NK/K effector cell to mediate LDCC was examined here using the two target conjugate assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effector cells were Ficoll-Hypaque PBL or LGL-enriched fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The targets used were K562 or MOLT for NK, RAJI coated with antibody for ADCC, and RAJI coated with PHA or Con A or modified by NaIO4 for LDCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the two-target conjugate assay, one of the targets is <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> labeled for identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results show that (a) LDCC copurifies with NK/K and is enriched in the LGL fraction, as measured in both the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-release assay and the single-cell assay for cytotoxicity; (b) single effector cells simultaneously bind to NK or ADCC and LDCC targets, revealing that single cells bear binding receptors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> targets; and (c) single lymphocytes were not able to kill both bound NK/K and LDCC targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, significant two-target killing was obtained when both targets were NK targets, ADCC targets, LDCC targets, or one NK and one ADCC target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the NK and LDCC effector cells are distinct subpopulations copurified in the LGL fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the results show that lectin is unable to trigger globally an NK effector cell to mediate cytotoxicity against a bound NK insensitive target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, although both NK and LDCC effector cells are present in the LGL fraction and can bind to both types of targets, the trigger of the lethal hit event is the function of specialized effector cells </plain></SENT>
