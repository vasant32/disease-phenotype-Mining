<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The age-specific prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (as reflected by the proportion of VCA-positive individuals) varied greatly up to the age of 10 years in the four populations studied, the West Nile District of Uganda being outstanding in having an early and massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differences were also observed between ethnic groups in Singapore, where the Chinese appeared to have a delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate compared to the Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immune response, as measured by the prevalence of CF/S antibodies and by the geometric mean titres (GMT) of VCA and CF/S antibodies, differed significantly between ethnic groups, Ugandan infants (1-3-year age-groups) having a humoral response to VCA and CF/S antigens as high as or higher than that of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, decreasing thereafter to levels lower than those of any other ethnic group observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indians in Singapore, known to be at no risk for NPC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, exhibited a higher and steadier immune response to VCA in going from young to old age-groups than did the Chinese </plain></SENT>
