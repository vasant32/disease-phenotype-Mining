<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The samples were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and positive results were confirmed by a newly developed unlabeled antibody-peroxidase procedure with enhanced sensitivity for detection of antibody binding to immunoblots of HTLV-III antigen, demonstrating antibodies to proteins with molecular weights of 24,000, 41,000, and 76,000 in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> positive samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of titration data indicated enhanced titers of antibody against HTLV-III and HTLV-I when coinfection occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence and relatively low titers [compared to serum from patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>)] of antibodies recognizing HTLV-III proteins in sera from this population at a time that may predate or coincide with the appearance or spread of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> agent (HTLV-III) suggest that the virus detected may have been a predecessor of HTLV-III or is HTLV-III itself but existing in a population acclimated to its presence </plain></SENT>
