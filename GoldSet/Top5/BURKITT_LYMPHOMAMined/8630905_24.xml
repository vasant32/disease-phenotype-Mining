<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in central Africa is more often EBV-associated than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in the United States, where seroconversion for EBV occurs somewhat later than in Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the EBV association rate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> may correlate more with the socioeconomic status of the population studied, which influences the age of EBV seroconversion, than with such factors as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e>, which may relate to the overall higher incidence rate in endemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-one patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in Egypt, which differs both climatically and racially from central African countries (i.e., Kenya, Uganda) where <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> is endemic, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> biopsies were evaluated for EBV-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (EBER1) by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in situ hybridization, analyzed for p53 protein expression using the monoclonal antibody D07, and immunophenotyped using a panel of monoclonal antibodies that included L26 (CD20), Leu 22 (CD43), and A6 (CD45RO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve cases were evaluable for EBV subtype by polymerase chain reaction with EBV-specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 9 years (range, 2-22 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The biopsy site was extranodal in 29 patients and nodal in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 41 cases were documented as B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A hybridization signal for EBER1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was identified in greater than 95% of the neoplastic cells in 30 of 41 cases (73%), whereas no signal was observed in 11 cases (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus subtype 1 was found in 10 patients, subtype 2 in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for p53 was observed in greater than 5% of the neoplastic cells in 9 of 37 cases (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was observed between EBV positivity and sex, biopsy site, or p53 immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of EBV in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> from Egypt is slightly lower than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in endemic regions, but significantly higher than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus positivity probably reflects the socioeconomic status of the patient population, and age at seroconversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of EBV subtype 1 suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> does not play a role in Egyptian Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in contrast to endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in which holoendemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> is thought to contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo>, a higher incidence rate, and the observed prevalence of subtype 2 </plain></SENT>
