<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect was also produced by L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17485">homocystine</z:chebi> but not by other amino acids including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16867">D-methionine</z:chebi> and L-ethionine, suggesting that this effect is exerted by a common intermediate of methionine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17485">homocystine</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16643">L-Methionine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17588">L-homocysteine</z:chebi>, S-adenosylmethionine (<z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi>), and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) are not inhibitors of thymidylate synthase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand the capacity of the cells to incorporate serine 3-carbon and glycine 2-carbon into DNA is impaired by the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16643">L-methionine</z:chebi> or L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17485">homocystine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies with cell-free extracts demonstrated that the glycine cleavage enzyme is inhibited by 45% by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16643">L-methionine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17588">L-homocysteine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> or SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serine hydroxymethylase on the other hand was slightly stimulated by these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26833">sulfur</z:chebi>-containing compounds and this stimulation was shown to occur in the intact cell as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that when levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16643">L-methionine</z:chebi> metabolites are elevated, there is an increase in the use of glycine to maintain the intracellular concentration of serine, which is required for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> detoxification by conversion to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reduction in <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> synthesis caused by excess <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16643">L-methionine</z:chebi> or L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17485">homocystine</z:chebi> may result from increased utilization of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50728">one-carbon units</z:chebi> for serine synthesis </plain></SENT>
