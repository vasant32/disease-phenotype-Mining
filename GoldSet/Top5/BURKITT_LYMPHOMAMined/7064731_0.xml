<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Six established Japanese Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines including one case with null cell type were studied by chromosomal banding techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The modal chromosome number was diploid or nearly diploid in five cases and hyperdiploid in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The marker chromosome 14q+ was observed in four of the six cases; the origin of the extra band was a chromosome 8 in three including the null cell case but could not be identified in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two cases lacking the 14q+ marker had variant translocations involving the long arm of chromosome 8, one of which carried a translocation, t(8;22) (q24;q13) and the other a translocation, t(2;8) (p12;q24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although structural and/or numerical aberrations were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six cell lines, chromosome 8 was the one most consistently involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This frequent involvement of chromosome 8 in aberrations; therefore, may be an important event in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> rather than the presence of a 14q+ marker chromosome </plain></SENT>
