<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To determine the feasibility and results of treating children with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) according to very intensive protocols based on the German Berlin Frankfurt MÃ¼nster NHL 90 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: From 1991 until 1995 eighty two patients less than 18 years of age with NHL were admitted to our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty three of them were eligible for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The entire group consisted of 43 males and 20 females (ratio 2.1:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age was 10 2/12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven had stage I disease, 4 stage II, 29 stage III and 19 stage IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologies represented were: large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 22, lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 19, and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 12 cases the immunophenotype was not further classified as to B-cell or T-cell subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified into the therapy groups "B" or "non B" according to histopathology, clinical stage and LDH level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therapy for the B group consisted of 2, 4 or 6 courses of intensive 5 day pulses of 6 drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients in the non B group received the protocol for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> including reinduction and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> irradiation for advanced stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 35 months the probability of event free survival (pEFS) at 5 years 70% and overall survival 73% for entire group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For therapy group B pEFS was 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The non B therapy group had a pEFS 60% (p = 0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly better outcome for children classified as stage I and II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference between stage III and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Treatment results were comparable between NHL subtypes, except for large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, which did significantly better (pEFS 90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of protocols based on BFM 90 study in the Czech Republic was feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The pEFS are approximately 10% lower than the German study but comparable to some other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Outcome for large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Reduction of treatment related complication and mortality rate as well as more precise classification are required </plain></SENT>
