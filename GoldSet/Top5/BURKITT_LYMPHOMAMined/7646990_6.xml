<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of EBV proteins and immunological properties were studied in the first stable cell line (SM) established from a patient presenting with persistent polyclonal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> (PPBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SM cells which represent a small population of EBV-positive atypical cells found in the peripheral blood of the patient express the KI-1 antigen (CD30) as well as the proto-oncogene bcl-2 product and cell surface markers of mature activated B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells harbour an EBV subtype A genome and contain EBNA2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This argues against a transformation-incompetent virus as the main cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> observed in our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Latent membrane protein (LMP1) was weakly expressed and found predominantly in a perinuclear localization, a location which could lead to decreased immunogenicity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar to the EBV-transformed marmoset cell line B95-8, SM cells were in part productively infected as transcription of the immediate early gene BZLF1 could be shown and in some cells high levels of EBV-genome were detected by in situ hybridization with a BamH1 W-probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparable to the atypical cells in the peripheral blood of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBV small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> were not detected with EBER-specific probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of interest, we noticed a markedly increased production of soluble CD21 (sCD21) antigen by SM cells as compared to LCL-type Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This could explain the elevated sCD21 levels observed in the serum of our PPBL patient and confirms our previous findings in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It also suggests a possible role of sCD21 in EBV-mediated regulation of the immune response and provides a possible explanation for the dysregulation of the humoral immune system observed in PPBl patients </plain></SENT>
