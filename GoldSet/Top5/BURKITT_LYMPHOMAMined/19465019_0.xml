<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is the subject of intense scrutiny due to its preferential targeting of transformed cells for deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on recent findings that the TRAIL-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> inducing signaling complex (DISC) forms and signals at the plasma membrane without being internalized, we investigated the possibility that agents that prevent endocytosis may stabilize the surface bound DISC and thereby enhance TRAIL-dependent signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We utilized phenylarsine <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi>), a trivalent arsenical that has been reported to inhibit endocytosis and to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> could, by two separate and independent activities, enhance TRAIL-induced killing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, we found that rather than synergizing with TRAIL, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> was an effective inhibitor of TRAIL-induced killing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 to the TRAIL-dependent DISC was diminished in a concentration-dependent manner in cells exposed to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> could not be reversed by washing cells under non-reducing conditions, suggesting covalent linkage of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> with its cellular target(s); however, 2,3-dimercaptoethanol effectively overcame the inhibitory action of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> and restored sensitivity to TRAIL-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> inhibited formation of the TRAIL-dependent DISC and therefore prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subsequent apoptotic events </plain></SENT>
