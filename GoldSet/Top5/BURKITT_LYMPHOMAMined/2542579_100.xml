<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One region is a family of 30-base-pair (bp) repeats and is activated by EBNA1 to act as a transcriptional enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other region contains a 65-bp dyad symmetry and lacks enhancer function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To explore the functional differences between the two regions, we determined oriP activities as functions of the number of 30-bp repeats and compared them with activities determined when tandem copies of the dyad symmetry region were used to replace the 30-bp repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three conclusions have been drawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(i) Activation of the 30-bp repeats by EBNA1 to enhance transcription or to permit plasmid maintenance is a highly cooperative process involving at least six or seven 30-bp repeats for full activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(ii) Tandem copies of the dyad symmetry region cooperatively enhance transcription but are less effective than 30-bp repeats providing a similar number of EBNA1-binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(iii) Tandem copies of the dyad symmetry region alone cooperatively activate replication, suggesting that the region contains the actual origin of replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also report that while rodent-derived cell lines do not support replication of EBV-derived plasmids they do permit EBNA1-dependent enhancer activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EBV plasmid replication thus requires the interaction of EBNA1 or oriP with a host factor that is not required for enhancement of transcription </plain></SENT>
