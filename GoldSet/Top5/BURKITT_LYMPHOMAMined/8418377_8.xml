<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The independent significance of CD10 expression in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) is uncertain because most studies have not adjusted for other risk features, such as age and immunophenotype, or for treatment effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reassessed the clinical importance of CD10 expression in patients who received highly effective contemporary treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD10 antigen was detected in blast cells from 384 of 408 patients (94%) with B-lineage ALL and 36 of 90 (40%) with T-cell ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the B-lineage subgroup, CD10 expression was associated with favorable presenting features: age &gt; or = 1 year, lower leukocyte count (&lt; 50 x 10(9)/l), and leukemic cell DNA index &gt; or = 1.16 or hyperdiploidy &gt; 50 chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One-half of the patients with CD10- B-lineage ALL had 11q23 chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Separate analysis of the marker in T-cell ALL revealed no differences between CD10+ and CD10- cases in clinical features or karyotypic patterns, with the exception of a lower frequency of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and a higher frequency of 9p abnormalities in the former subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD10+ T-cell cases were also significantly more likely than CD10- cases to coexpress CD21, CD1, CD4, or CD8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lack of CD10 expression was independently associated with an adverse prognosis in T-cell ALL (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, for the larger subgroup of patients with B-lineage ALL, CD10 expression has no independent prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
