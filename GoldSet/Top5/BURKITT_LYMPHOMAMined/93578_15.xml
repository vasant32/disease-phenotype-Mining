<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Coded sera from 54 patients with African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) were titrated for antibodies against an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced membrane antigen in the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The titers were then correlated with the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> growth following chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 74% of the patients with high ADCC titers (greater than 3,840), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed partial or complete regression following therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the medium-titered group (240-3,840), 36% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed some response to therapy, while only 29% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the low group (less than 240) responded to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results indicated that, as previously reported for patients with nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, ADCC titers may be a prognotic value in patients with this EBV-associated disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to determine the identity of the ADCC antigen, some of these sera were examined for antibody to the four major MA components so far identified in the membrane of EBV-infected Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sera with high ADCC titers in general contained antibody to the four major MA components, while low-titered sera usually contained antibody to three or less of these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were exceptions to this pattern, however, indicating that the ADCC antigen might differ from the four EBV-induced membrane components so far identified </plain></SENT>
