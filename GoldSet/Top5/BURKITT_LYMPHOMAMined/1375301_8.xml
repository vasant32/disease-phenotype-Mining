<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rare subpopulations of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow B lymphoid cells expressing immunophenotypes typically found in B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> (ALL) were sought by multiparameter flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, CD34+ marrow leukocytes were isolated by immune adherence using immunomagnetic microspheres, and analyzed for coexpression of the following pairs of membrane antigens: CD34 CD22; CD34 CD20; and CD10 CD22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase expression was not assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three antigen combinations were found on small percentages of the CD34-enriched cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, unseparated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> low density marrow leukocytes were examined by 'gating' on cells with the right-angle light scatter of lymphoid cells, plus either CD34+ or CD10+ immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This independent approach confirmed that rare subsets of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells coexpress 'immature' and 'mature' differentiation antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, remission marrow cells were examined from two children who had completed therapy for ALL two and four months earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both specimens had a more than threefold increase in CD34+ cells over <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow, and cells coexpressing immature and mature cell surface antigens were easily detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that immunophenotypes characteristic of B-lineage ALL, previously labeled 'asynchronous' with respect to the developmental sequence of the majority of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphoid cells, exist at low frequency in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow </plain></SENT>
