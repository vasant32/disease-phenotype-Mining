<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human epithelial line U, which is partially infectable with EBV, was hybridized with the EBV-genome carrying Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines P3HR-1 and Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Authenticity of the hybrids U-Put and U-Dut was established by isoenzyme studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the two hybrids carried the EBV genome derived from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> parent, being 100% positive for Epstein-Barr-virus-associated nuclear antigen (EBNA), they resembled the U parent in many respects: they were deficient for membrane immunoglobulins and Fc receptors, and had a lower concentration of EBV-C3 receptors than either parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike the P3HR-1 parent, U-Put hybrid was nonpermissive for both the EBV cycle antigens, early antigen (EA) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (VCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inducing agent 12-O-tetra-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23574">decanoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="45127">phorbol-13-acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) caused distinct <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> early antigen synthesis (EA) in U-Put, lower, however, than that of the parental P3HR-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>U-Dut was completely nonpermissive and noninducible for early and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, even an epithelial parent infectable by EBV restricted, although not completely, expression of EBV antigens, with the exception of EBNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that EBNA is an autonomous function of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome, independent of host cell control; the latter regulates expression of antigens related to <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hybrids U-Put and U-Dut resembled the U parent also in regard to growth in soft agar and tumorigenicity in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice, although in this respect the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> parental properties were not completely eclipsed </plain></SENT>
