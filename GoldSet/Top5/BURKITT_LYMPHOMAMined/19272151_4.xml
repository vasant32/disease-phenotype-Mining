<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: EBV lytic cycle activators, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol esters</z:chebi>, anti-immunoglobulin, transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in EBV-negative but not in EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the molecular mechanisms allowing EBV-infected cells to be protected, we examined the expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and cellular antiapoptotic proteins as well as the activation of signal transduction pathways in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-derived Raji cells exposed to lytic cycle inducing agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our data show that, following EBV activation, the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and the cellular anti-apoptotic proteins <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>-1 and BCL-2 were quickly up-regulated and that Raji cells remained viable even when exposed simultaneously to P(BU)(2), <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> and TGFbeta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here that inhibition of p38 pathway, during EBV activation, led to a three fold increment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and largely prevented lytic gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that, during the switch from the latent to the lytic phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, p38 MAPK phosphorylation plays a key role both for protecting the host cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as well as for inducing <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because Raji cells are defective for late antigens expression, we hypothesize that the increment of LMP1 gene expression in the early phases of EBV lytic cycle might contribute to the survival of the EBV-positive cells </plain></SENT>
