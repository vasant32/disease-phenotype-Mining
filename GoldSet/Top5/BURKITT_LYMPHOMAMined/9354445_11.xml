<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate in these preclinical studies that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> severe combined immunodeficient mice injected with the human B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Ramos are cured when treated with a combination of anti-CD19, -CD22, and -CD38-saporin immunotoxins (ITs; termed 3BIT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each component IT used individually did not cure the majority of animals but did significantly prolong their survival compared with PBS sham-treated controls, although the majority succumbed eventually to disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The very significant improvement obtained with the three-IT combination 3BIT was not due to an antibody or antibody-plus-IT effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We postulate that by targeting against these three cell surface molecules, we have effectively ensured delivery of saporin to each <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell with growth potential within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, thus overcoming the problems of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of target antigen expression that can limit the therapeutic efficacy of single-IT therapy or even two-IT combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These "proof of principle" findings have an obvious important bearing on antibody-based therapies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and provide the rationale needed for the design and implementation of clinical trials with such combinations </plain></SENT>
