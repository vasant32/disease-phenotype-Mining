<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the potential of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines to produce and respond to the cytotoxins, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and lymphotoxin (LT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transformation in vitro of peripheral blood B cells by EBV from seven different donors resulted in spontaneous production of both LT (11,542 pg/ml +/- 7546, mean +/- SD) and, to a lesser extent, TNF-alpha (197 pg/ml +/- 174) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines derived from in vivo transformation which developed a 'LCL-like' phenotype in vitro (group III) produced more LT (1990 pg/ml +/- 1740) than the 'group I' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines (&lt; 40 pg/ml LT) which had maintained the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> biopsy <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transformation of peripheral blood B cells to generate LCL also resulted in an increase in surface p75 (p &lt; 0.02) and to a lesser extent p55 (not significant, ns) TNF receptor (TNF-R) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar increases in surface TNF-R (p75 p &lt; 0.02, p55 ns) were observed on the 'group III' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines compared with the 'group I' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proliferation of an LCL and a 'group III' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line in vitro was via an autocrine loop since inhibition of LT reduced proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This proliferation could also be blocked in the presence of the antagonistic anti-p55 TNF-R antibody, H398, but not the antagonistic antibody anti-p75 TNF-R antibody UTR-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, proliferation could be induced with the p55 agonistic antibody, HTR-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to these observations with p55 TNF-R antibodies, two out of six of the 'group III' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines (Jijoye and Oba) only expressed the p75 TNF-R and proliferation of these cells could only be blocked by the antagonistic anti-p75 TNF-R antibody UTR-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that LT is an autocrine growth factor for lymphoblastoid cells, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines which display an LCL phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, although both TNF-R are increased on the surface of these cells, this autocrine growth signal is mediated principally through binding to the p55 TNF-R </plain></SENT>
