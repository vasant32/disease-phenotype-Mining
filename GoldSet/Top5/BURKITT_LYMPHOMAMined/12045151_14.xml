<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, detection of differential transcript levels requires a reproducible sample (target) preparation method in addition to a high-performance microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we optimized a target-preparation method that converts the poly(A)(+) <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> fraction of total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> into complementary DNA, then generates <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-labeled complementary <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from the cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured the efficiency of incorporation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-containing <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> by an enzymatic digestion, followed by resolution via analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the target was hybridized to a sensitive and reproducible microarray platform, low coefficients of variation in both hybridization intensities and differential expression ratios across target preparations were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nearly identical hybridization intensities and expression ratios are observed regardless of whether poly(A)(+)-enriched <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> or total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> is used as the starting material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We show the ability to discern biological and production variability through the use of different lots of commercial samples as visualized by hierarchical clustering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Automation of the target-preparation procedure shows equivalence to the manual procedure, reproducible yields of target, and low variability as measured by hybridization to microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> mixing experiments show a linear and quantitative amplification in probe hybridization signals for &gt;6000 genes across the entire signal range </plain></SENT>
