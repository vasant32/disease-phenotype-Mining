<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antigen was extracted by 3 M <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> from ribonucleoprotein particles (RNP), obtained from the nuclear 0.01 M <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">Tris</z:chebi> extract, and was purified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52255">hydroxylapatite</z:chebi> chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, and preparative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its molecular weight was 38 kilodalton (kDa) as determined by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tryptic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> map of 125I-labeled antigen contained seven major <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antigen was not found in HeLa cells, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human liver or in Namalwa cells that had not been induced by the virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that this antigen was produced in Namalwa cells as a result of induction by the NDV virus </plain></SENT>
