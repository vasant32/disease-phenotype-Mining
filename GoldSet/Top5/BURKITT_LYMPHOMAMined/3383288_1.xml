<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We separated a family of Cd2+-binding proteins from Cd2+-exposed human peripheral blood lymphocytes by gel filtration chromatography, and characterized them by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proteins showed electrophoretic behaviours closely similar to metallothioneins (MTs) of HeLa cells derived from human cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proteins were also found in Cd2+-exposed monocytes, and were inducible by Cd2+ in both lymphocytes and monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-MT serum specifically precipitated these proteins, which were thus identified as MTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the two classes of the cells involved in the immune system possess a protective mechanism against Cd2+ through MTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A variety of human lymphoid cell lines derived from both T and B cells were also found to have capacity to synthesize MTs in response to Cd2+ </plain></SENT>
