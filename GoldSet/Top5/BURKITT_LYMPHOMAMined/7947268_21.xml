<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-third of first relapses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> occur at an extramedullary site without morphological evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the high incidence of subsequent medullary relapse in these cases strongly suggests that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> is present at submicroscopic levels at the time of 'isolated' relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PCR analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements now allows detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> at levels as low as 0.001% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have therefore used this technique to reassess bone marrow status at morphologically isolated relapse in 13 children with B-lineage ALL (11 with off-treatment relapses, two on treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 12 of these 13 patients marrow disease was detectable by PCR at the time of this relapse--in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases at levels below the threshold of light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Where relapse occurred off-therapy this indicated re-emergence of disease. since <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> has never been detected by PCR at this stage in patients remaining in long-term remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both patients who relapsed on-therapy the level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> at the time of relapse represented an increase on that seen in their previous marrow sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that re-emerging <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow disease</z:e> can be detected in most cases of 'isolated' relapse when investigated by this highly sensitive technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings at a molecular level confirm a long-held clinical suspicion and indicate that full systemic re-induction as well as local therapy is obligatory for these children </plain></SENT>
