<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This process is accompanied by a series of biologic changes similar to those in oncogenic transformation by known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> viruses (e.g. polyoma, SV40, Rous SV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They include altered growth properties and membrane changes, one of which is expressed in an increased agglutinability by Con-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although most transformed cell systems are more agglutinable than the non-transformed counterparts it is controversial whether they possess similar or changed numbers of lectin receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since little was known about lectin receptor densities of virus transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, we set out to determine the densities of Con-A receptors on the EBV-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines BJAB and Ramos and their EBV-converted sublines by simultaneous recording of the cell membrane fluorescence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-Con-A and the cell volume using the FLUVO-METRICELL flow cytometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> gave rise to cell lines with a significantly elevated Con-A receptor density compared to the EBV-negative parental lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The similar changes found in a number of independently converted sublines suggest that they are due to the direct or indirect action of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome </plain></SENT>
