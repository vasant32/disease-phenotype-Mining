<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Demonstrating the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 T of ultrasmall particle <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> (USPIO)-antibody bound to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in vitro and in a murine xenotransplant model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human D430B cells or Raji Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were incubated in vitro with different amounts of commercially available USPIO-anti-CD20 antibodies and cell pellets were stratified in a test tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For in vivo studies, D430B cells and Raji <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were inoculated subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI at 1.5 T was performed with T1-weighted three-dimensional fast field echo sequences (17/4.6/13 degrees ) and T2-weighted three-dimensional fast-field echo sequences (50/12/7 degrees ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For in vivo studies MRI was performed before and 24 h after USPIO-anti-CD20 administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: USPIO-anti-CD20-treated D430B cells, showed a dose-dependent decrease in signal intensity (SI) on T2*-weighted images and SI enhancement on T1-weighted images in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Raji cells showed lower SI changes, in accordance to the fivefold lower expression of CD20 on Raji with respect to D430B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo 24 h after USPIO-anti-CD20 administration, both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showed an inhomogeneous decrease of SI on T2*-weighted images and SI enhancement on T1-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MRI at 1.5 T is able to detect USPIO-antibody conjugates targeting a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated antigen in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
