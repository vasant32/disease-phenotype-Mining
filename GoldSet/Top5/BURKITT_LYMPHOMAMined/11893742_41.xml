<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined transcripts for Kv1.3, h-erg, h-eag, and BEC1 genes in primary lymphocytes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and in several hematopoietic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, BEC1, formerly thought to be brain-specific, was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> examined, in resting peripheral blood lymphocytes, and in proliferating activated tonsillar cells, lymphocytes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren</z:e>'s patients, and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only h-erg <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was up-regulated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, but this was not due to proliferation per se, because it was not elevated in any of the proliferating noncancerous lymphocyte types examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nor did h-erg transcript levels correlate with the B-cell subset, because it was elevated in immature neoplastic B-CLL cells (CD5(+)) and in a CD5(-) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Raji) but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e> cells (enriched in CD5(+) B-cells) or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cells, which are mature CD5(-) B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protein and whole cell current levels roughly corresponded with the amount of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressed in three hematopoietic cell lines: CEM (an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic leukemic line), K562 (a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelogenous leukemic line), and U937 (an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> promyelocytic leukemic line) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The selective HERG channel blocker, E-4031, reduced proliferation of CEM, U937, and K562 cells, and this appears to be the first direct evidence of a functional role for the HERG current in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Selective up-regulation of h-erg appears to occur in neoplastic hematopoietic cells, thus providing a marker and potential therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
