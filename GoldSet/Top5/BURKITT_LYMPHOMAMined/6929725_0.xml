<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two previously established cell lines, a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, B35M, and a B-lymphoblastoid cell line, B411-4, derived from a hematologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> person, were used for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten million cells were needed in order for the BALM-2 cell line to grow with 74% success in the immunosuppressed mice, but 1000 million cells were needed in order for the NALM-1 cell line to grow with 74% success in those mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As in the case of the BALM-2 line, 10 million cells of the B35M cell line were needed for 100% success in heterotransplantation, whereas 30 million cells of the B411-4 cell line resulted in 20% success of heterotransplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a semisolid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> (0.15%) medium, the cloning efficiencies of BALM-2, B35M, and B411-4 were 1.52--2.08, 26.31--38.46, and 0.09--0.12, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With as many as 25,000 cells per well plated, NALM-1 did not produce any colonies in the semisolid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike most previous findings, those of the present study suggest that the heterotransplantability and clonability of cultured cells may not be invariably reliable characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> proven human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The behavior of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines representing their respective original <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> clones is interpreted as reflecting the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> inherent in the biologic characteristics seen in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
