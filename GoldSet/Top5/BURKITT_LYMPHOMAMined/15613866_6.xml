<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 77-year-old man with disseminated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> was referred to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An inguinal lymph node biopsy specimen had the appearance of composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> consisting of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and atypical Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow was involved, and chromosomal analysis of the marrow showed t(8;14) and t(14;18) in identical cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent systemic chemotherapy but died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 4 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reactions performed on cells obtained from follicular and diffuse components by laser capture microdissection showed the two components to be clonally identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, fluorescence in situ hybridization performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections demonstrated an immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH)/BCL2 translocation signal in both follicular and diffuse components, but an IGH/c-MYC translocation signal in only the diffuse component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the atypical Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> arose from the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as a consequence of the additional IGH/c-MYC translocation, then involving the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
