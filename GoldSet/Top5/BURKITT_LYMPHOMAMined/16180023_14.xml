<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with the development of several lymphoid and epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EBV latent protein, EBV Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA1), is detectable in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and is essential for replication and maintenance of the latent episome of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here examined whether the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference (RNAi) technique could be employed to suppress expression of EBNA1 in EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Raji cell line expressing small hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (shRNAs) against EBNA1 was established and EBNA1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level was determined by real-time RT-PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of EBNA1 silence on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell growth and cell cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transfection of an EBNA1 RNAi plasmid resulted in substantial loss of EBNA1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and significantly inhibited proliferation of Raji cells relative to the control plasmid case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Suppression of EBNA1 was also associated with downregulation of EBV oncogene EBNA2, a decreased PCNA labeling index and increased G0/G1 fraction in cell cycle analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to potential therapeutic applications for vector-mediated siRNA delivery to control EBV-associated malignant disorders </plain></SENT>
