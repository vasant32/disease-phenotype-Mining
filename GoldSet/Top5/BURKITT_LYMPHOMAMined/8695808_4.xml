<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, we described a cell line (BRG-P) derived from a woman with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome that shared the same characteristic cytogenetic abnormalities as the patient's malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cell line contained subclones that displayed an isotype switch from IgM to IgA1 and an accumulation of point mutations in the Vh region genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because these two features suggested an antigen-driven process, we began a search for the antigen responsible for the stimulation of the malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we hypothesized that because the patient's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> had presented as a lymphomatous infiltration of the breast, the malignant B cells were recruited to this site because of the reactivity of their surface lg with breast tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A hybridoma (BRG-H) was obtained by fusing BRG-M cells (an IgM producing subclone of the BRG-P cell) with an appropriate cellular partner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal antibody (BRG MoAb) produced by this hybridoma reacted strongly with two of five <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cell lines and stained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant ductal epithelial cells on breast tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The antigen recognized by the BRG MoAb consisted of a single, minimally glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16541">polypeptide chain</z:chebi> of 45 kD (p45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BRG MoAb failed to react with a panel of human cell lines from different tissues, except for one cell line from a uterine cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No reactivity was detected for a panel of exogenous antigens from various pathogens, including human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus and self-antigens frequently recognized by polyspecific antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Experiments were performed to investigate the functional consequences of the interaction of surface IgM with its specific ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Coculture of BRG-M cells with p45+, but not with p45-, breast cells caused <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of BRG-M cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the interaction was shown by the observation that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was prevented by pretreatment of BRG-M cells with a monovalent F(ab') fragment of rabbit IgG antibody to human mu chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, only BRG-M cells, but not other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after exposure to p45+ breast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The interaction between the CD40 molecule expressed by BRG-M cells and its specific ligand (CD40L) prevented p45-induced cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because this interaction mimics that occurring in vivo between T and B cells during immune responses, our data suggest that various events contributed to the emergence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, in this particular patient, including antigenic stimulation possibly assisted by T-cell help </plain></SENT>
