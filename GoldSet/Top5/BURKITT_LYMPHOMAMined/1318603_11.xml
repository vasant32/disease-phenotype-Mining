<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the development of a method that should allow the insertion of a selective marker into any region of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome of strain B95-8 through homologous recombination with plasmids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this method, EBV recombinants are isolated as G418-resistant, immortalized B-cell clones or as G418-resistant, latently infected subclones of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of the productive replication origin of EBV, oriLyt, on the plasmid was found to increase the number of observed recombinant viruses by approximately 100-fold; this stimulation was observed when oriLyt was separated from the sites of recombination by several kilobases of nonhomologous DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Long segments of EBV DNA flanking the marker on the plasmid and/or a large plasmid size were inferred to be important for obtaining a high proportion of recombinant genomes that had recombined on both sides of the selective marker; otherwise, the recombinants that predominated had acquired the entire plasmid by recombining only on one side of the inserted marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to facilitate targeted insertion of genetic markers into the EBV genome, a cosmid vector carrying oriLyt was constructed and tested by using it to generate EBV mutants with the BALF2 open-reading frame disrupted </plain></SENT>
