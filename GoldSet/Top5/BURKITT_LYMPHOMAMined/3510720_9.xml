<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Effective autologous bone marrow transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is likely to depend upon the selective removal in vitro of malignant cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Highly specific cytotoxic conjugates formed by coupling ricin A chain to monoclonal antibodies might prove useful for the selective elimination of malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, ricin A chain conjugates have been prepared with several different murine monoclonal antibodies and tested for their ability to eliminate clonogenic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells from an excess of human bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most active reagents included an antibody:A chain conjugate which bound to the nonpolymorphic chain of the la molecule and another which reacted with the mu heavy chain of cell surface immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conjugates formed with anti-common <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> antigen, anti-Mr 26,000 glycoprotein, and anti-B1 were much less active on these Burkitt's cells, contrasting with results of complement-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cell kill was partially inhibited by the addition of greater than 2 X 10(6) human bone marrow cells/ml but could be potentiated by increasing the concentration of conjugate or by the addition of 10 mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">ammonium chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">ammonium chloride</z:chebi>, at least 4 logs of clonogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells could be eliminated within 24 h from a 20-fold excess of bone marrow using 10(-7) M ricin A chain linked to one or two different antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar treatment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow temporarily inhibited granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (cell) formation but did not compromise establishment of continuous bone marrow cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of selective elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells with A chain antibody conjugates was comparable to that achieved with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide or with multiple monoclonal antibodies and complement </plain></SENT>
