<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study examined the expression and structural intactness of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cells and determined the effect of PPARgamma ligands on growth and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We noted that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines expressed PPARgamma and no PPARgamma mutations were found in these cell lines as indicated by SSCP analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effect of the PPARgamma ligands on the proliferation, differentiation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of B type ALL cells was further examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of these cells with the PPARgamma ligands <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> (PGZ) and 15-deoxy-delta (12,14)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27485">prostaglandin J2</z:chebi> (15d-PGJ2) resulted in growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner which was associated with a G1 to S cell cycle arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, this effect appeared to be PPARgamma-independent since several PPARgamma <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> could not reverse this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differentiation was induced by this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four out of five cell lines underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after culture with the PPARgamma ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect was partially caspase-dependent because a pan-caspase inhibitor partially reversed this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results suggest that PPARgamma ligands may offer a new therapeutic approach to aid in the treatment of ALL </plain></SENT>
