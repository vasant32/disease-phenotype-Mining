<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The nontransforming Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) strain P3HR-1 is known to have a deletion of sequences of the long unique region adjacent to the large internal repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The deleted region is believed to be required for initiation of transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To establish a more detailed map of the deletion in P3HR-1 virus, SalI-A of the transforming strain M-<z:chebi fb="81" ids="2365,53554">ABA</z:chebi> and of P3HR-1 virus was cloned into the cosmid vector pHC79 and multiplied in Escherichia coli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cleavage sites for BamHI, BglII, EcoRI, PstI, SacI, SacII, and XhoI were determined in the recombinant plasmid clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the boundary between large internal repeats and the long unique region showed that in M-<z:chebi fb="81" ids="2365,53554">ABA</z:chebi> (EBV) the transition is different from that in B95-8 virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The map established for SalI-A of P3HR-1 virus revealed that, in contrast to previous reports, the deletion has a size of 6.5 kilobase pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It involves the junction between large internal repeats and the long unique region and includes more than half of the rightmost large internal repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The site of the deletion in the long unique region is located between a SacI and a SacII site, about 200 base pairs apart from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sequences neighboring the deletion in the long unique region showed homology to the nonrepeated sequences of the DS(R) (duplicated sequence, right) region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sequences of the large internal repeat are thus fused to sequences of the DS(L) (duplicated sequence, left) region in P3HR-1 virus DNA under elimination of the DS(L) repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Jijoye, the parental Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line from which the P3HR-1 line is derived by single-cell cloning, is known to produce a transforming virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the Jijoye (EBV) genome with cloned M-<z:chebi fb="81" ids="2365,53554">ABA</z:chebi> (EBV) probes specific for the sequences missing in P3HR-1 virus revealed that the sequences of M-<z:chebi fb="81" ids="2365,53554">ABA</z:chebi> (EBV) BamHI-H2 are not represented in Jijoye (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In Jijoye (EBV) the complete DS(L) region including the DS(L) repeats is, however, conserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of Jijoye (EBV) and of Jijoye virustransformed cell lines will be helpful to narrow down the region required for transformation </plain></SENT>
