<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cultures of Jijoye cells at 33 degrees C released a large amount of transforming EBV (10(5.2) of 50% transforming doses/ml) into the culture fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no infectious virus was produced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cultures at 37 degrees C during the course of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EBV (Jijoye EBV) from Jijoye line was found to possess only transforming activity, but not EA-inducing activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Jijoye EBV lacks adsorbing capacity to Jijoye cells, in contrast to P3HR-I EBV which can adsorb to Jijoye cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Jijoye cells were highly susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> with P3HR-I EBV as demonstrated by the induction of EA, VCA and infectious EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EBV induced by the P3HR-I EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> of Jijoye cells has also transforming activity but neither EA-inducing activity nor adsorbing capacity to Jijoye cells </plain></SENT>
