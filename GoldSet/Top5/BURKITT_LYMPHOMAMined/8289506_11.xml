<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> gene (RB) is a growth suppressor gene on the human chromosome 13q14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It encodes a 105 kDa phosphoprotein (p105), with DNA-binding capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>P105 is thought to be involved in cell cycle control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inactivation of RB is responsible for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastomas</z:hpo> and occurs frequently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>osteosarcomas</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149925" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="SCLC">small cell lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we looked at the RB-structure and expression in cell lines and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples from patients with high grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty five primary high grade NHL, the B-lymphoblastoid cell line IM-9 and the NHL cell line WSU-NHL were studied for RB structure by Southern blotting and for RB-expression by Northern blotting, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experiments freshly cryopreserved material was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Southern and Northern experiments were performed with the 0.9 kb and 3.8 kb RB-cDNA probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the detection of p105 two different anti-p105-monoclonal antibodies were used in immunocytochemistry and Western blotting experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No RB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and no p105 could be found in IM-9 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty six high grade NHL samples (58%) showed no p105 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> 16 out of 21 and in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> five out of eight showed no p105-expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>P105 expression is absent in 58% of high grade NHL, particularly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, suggesting that inactivation of RB may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of high grade NHL </plain></SENT>
