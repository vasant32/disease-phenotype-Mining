<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: BACH2, a B-cell-specific transcription repressor, is abundantly expressed in lymphocytes of B-cell lineage as well as B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACH2 possesses an inhibitory effect on proliferation of Raji cell lines derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the prognostic significance of BACH2 expression was examined in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: BACH2 expression was immunohistochemically examined on the paraffin-embedded sections obtained by biopsy from 108 patients (62 males and 46 females; age range, 23 to 85 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Staining intensity in the cytoplasm of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells was categorized as equal to or stronger (level 1) or weaker (level 2) than that in the endothelial cells in the same specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Level 1 and 2 expression of BACH2 was found in 32.4% and 67.6% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with level 1 expression showed significantly better disease-free and overall survival rate than those with level 2 expression (both P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed BACH2 expression level together with performance status, elevated serum level of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, and treatment response to be independent factors for prognosis of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BACH2 expression level is a useful marker to predict disease-free and overall survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
