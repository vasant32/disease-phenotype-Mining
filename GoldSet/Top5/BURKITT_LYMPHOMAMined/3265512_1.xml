<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Basement membrane proteins laminin, type IV collagen and aminoterminal propeptide of type III collagen (type III pN-collagen) are important components of extracellular matrix of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymph nodes; they are present in reticular fibres and in the walls of blood vessels and sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the distribution of these proteins in 45 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> representing different types of Kiel classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Light microscopic immunohistochemistry was used on sections from formalin fixed, paraffin embedded biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reticular cells were identified by using antibodies against S-100 protein, a marker for dendritic and interdigitating reticulum cells, and against cystatin A for the demonstration of follicular dendritic reticulum cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings of the immunohistochemical stainings were generally similar in the different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus the method for the demonstration of extracellular matrix proteins could not give obvious aid for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BM stainings proved to be efficient in the demonstration of sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Marginal and medullary sinuses of the nodal cases were either totally or partly spared and open also in the cases in which there was extracapsular growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fibre content was variable, but generally the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three extracellular matrix proteins was comparable with each other and mainly corresponded with the pattern seen in conventional Gomori's reticulin stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This also holds for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue infiltrated through the capsule and for extranodal cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Areas of <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> of some cases contained only type III pN-collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reticular fibres were at places seen to be closely associated with cells of spindle or dendritic shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A few reticulum cells could be found to show cytoplasmic staining for laminin, type IV collagen and type III pN collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that the cells are synthetizing these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The amount of cells staining for cystatin A or S-100 protein did not generally correlate with the amount of fibres, and most of the stained cells were not closely associated with fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results show that in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> basement membrane proteins and type III pN-collagen are important components of reticular fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Results also indirectly support the main role of fibroblastic reticulum cells in the production of the fibres </plain></SENT>
