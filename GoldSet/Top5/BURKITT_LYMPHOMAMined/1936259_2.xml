<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA damage was proportional to the concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> oxidase and to the time of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was prevented by the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>, or by the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi>, or both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and catalase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> from damaged cells was detectable 12 h after the inhibition of cloning efficiency and the production of DNA breakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that DNA damage induced by the oxygen products precedes the severe lesion to the cellular membrane </plain></SENT>
