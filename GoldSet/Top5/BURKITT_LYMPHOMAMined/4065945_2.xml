<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The evidence for both of these effects is equivocal, but both are quite strong in the West Nile district of Uganda, where the disease has been most intensively studied epidemiologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have assumed that the interval between some final triggering event and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease follows a log-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distribution, and we have examined the range of values of the mean and variance of that distribution which are consistent with the observed seasonal variation in incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These analyses would suggest that to explain the seasonal variation in the West Nile the latent period must be less than one year on average, and rarely exceed two years </plain></SENT>
