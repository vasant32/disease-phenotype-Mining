<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Constitutive expression of major histocompatibility complex class II genes is acquired very early in B-cell ontogeny and is maintained up to the B-cell blast stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Terminal differentiation in plasma cells is, however, accompanied by a loss of class II gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In B cells this gene system is under the control of several loci encoding transacting factors with activator function, one of which, the aIr-1 gene product, operates across species barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report human class II gene expression is shown to be extinguished in somatic cell hybrids between the human class II-positive B-cell line Raji and the mouse class II-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> cell line P3-U1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> murine chromosomes are retained in these hybrids and no preferential segregation of a specific human chromosome is observed, the results are compatible with the presence of suppressor factors of mouse origin, operating across species barriers and inhibiting class II gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Suppression seems to act at the level of transcription or accumulation of class II-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, since no human, and very few murine, class II transcripts are detectable in the hybrids </plain></SENT>
