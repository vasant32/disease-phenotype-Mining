<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For visualization of the antigens, HeLa cell nucleolar or nuclear protein fractions were analyzed on 4% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> isoelectric focusing gels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gels were incubated with rabbit antisera to HeLa cell nucleoli and then with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>- or peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With this technique, two major nucleolar antigens (focusing at pH 6.3 and pH 6.1) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These antigens were also found in the Namalwa cell, but not in human liver cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Purification of the antigen(s) was achieved by selective extraction of Namalwa cell nuclei with 10 mM <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">Tris</z:chebi>-HCl (pH 8), 40 to 100% <z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> precipitation, diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography in which the antigen was eluted with 0.15 M <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> buffer (DE-0.15M fraction), and use of isoelectric focusing gels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immunostained bands (HuAg 6.3 and HuAg 6.1) and the bright nucleolar immunofluorescence of the HeLa cells were not observed after the antisera were preabsorbed with the DE-0.15M fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immunostained bands (HuAg 6.3 and HuAg 6.1) and the nucleolar immunofluorescence of the HeLa cells were also observed when isoelectric focusing gels were incubated with antiserum from rabbits immunized with the DE-0.15M fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi> second dimension of the two-dimensional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, the antigen(s) migrated as single spots with appraent molecular weights of 54,000 </plain></SENT>
