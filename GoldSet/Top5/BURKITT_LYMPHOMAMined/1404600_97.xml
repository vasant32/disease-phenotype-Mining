<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LMP is believed to play an important role in Epstein-Barr virus transformation and has been shown to induce expression of several cellular proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a series of experiments that demonstrated that LMP is an efficient transactivator of expression from the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus type 1 long terminal repeat (HIV-1 LTR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutation or deletion of the NF-kappa B elements in the LTR abolished the transactivation, indicating that the LMP effect on HIV expression was due to induction of NF-kappa B activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiments in which the HIV-1 Tat protein was coexpressed in cells together with LMP showed that Tat was able to potentiate the transactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, a synergistic effect of the two proteins was observed even in the absence of the recognized target region for Tat (TAR) in the HIV-1 LTR </plain></SENT>
