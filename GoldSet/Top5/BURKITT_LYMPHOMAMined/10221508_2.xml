<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used a <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mouse model of human B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> to examine the antileukemic activity of temozolomide in comparison to as well as in combination with B43-<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> anti-CD19 immunotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred percent of the 20 PBS-treated control mice died of disseminated human B-lineage ALL at 32 to 64 days after the inoculation of 1x10(6) NALM-6 cells, with a median event free survival time of 43 +/- 1 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Temozolomide, when administered i.p. for 5 consecutive days at a dose level of 411 mg/m2 or as a single 750 mg/m2 bolus dose, elicited significant antileukemic activity and improved survival in this <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mouse model of human B-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median survival times were 43 +/- 1 days for PBS-treated mice, 56 +/- 16 days for mice injected with the 5-day temozolomide program, and 64 +/- 15 days for mice treated with a single bolus dose of temozolomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, temozolomide was not as effective as B43-<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas only 40 +/- 21% of mice treated with temozolomide survived beyond 120 days, B43-<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> treatment resulted in 74 +/- 7% survival in the same model system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of temozolomide with B43-<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> was well tolerated by mice but it was not significantly more effective than B43-<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Temozolomide may have very limited potential as an antileukemic agent for treatment of B-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
