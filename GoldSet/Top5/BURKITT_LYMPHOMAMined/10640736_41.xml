<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FADD also plays a role in embryonic development and the cell cycle reentry of T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FADD is phosphorylated at serine residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now show that phosphorylation exclusively occurs at serine 194 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of FADD was found to correlate with the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cells arrested at the G2/M boundary with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34892">nocodazole</z:chebi>, FADD was quantitatively phosphorylated, whereas only nonphosphorylated FADD was found in cells arrested in G1/S with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this context, we have identified a 70-kDa cell cycle-regulated kinase that specifically binds to the C-terminal half of FADD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is independent of the cell cycle, phosphorylation of FADD may regulate its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-independent functions </plain></SENT>
