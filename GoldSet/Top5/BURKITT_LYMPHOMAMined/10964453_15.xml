<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polyploid giant cells arise by endo-reduplication in the first week after a single 10 Gray dose of irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within the giant cells a sub-nuclear structure is apparent and within this, sub-nuclear autonomy is evident, as displayed by independent nuclear structure and DNA replication in different parts of the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of these cells soon die as apoptotic polykaryons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, approximately 10-20% of giant cells remain viable into the second week after irradiation and begin vigorous extrusion of large degraded chromatin masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the second week, the giant cells begin to reconstruct their nuclei into polyploid 'bouquets', where chromosome double-loops are formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the bouquets return to an interphase state and separate into several secondary nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The individual sub-nuclei then resume DNA synthesis with mitotic divisions and sequester cytoplasmic territories around themselves, giving rise to the secondary cells, which continue mitotic propagation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This process of giant cell formation, reorganization and breakdown appears to provide an additional mechanism for repairing double-strand DNA breaks within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
