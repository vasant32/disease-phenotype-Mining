<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The detection of chromosomal translocations by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is widely performed, but very few studies have attempted to apply this technique to paraffin-embedded routine biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the analysis of paraffin sections from 36 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biopsies for MYC translocation breakpoints by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The probes consisted of multi-YAC constructs that flanked the breakpoint region and that, therefore, separate upon a chromosomal translocation and generate split (or "segregated") signals (rather than a more ambiguous "co-localization" pattern, obtained when the two partners in a hybrid gene are detected) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were assessed by a simple approach that avoids the counting of signal numbers per nucleus and so is appropriate for use in routine practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 19 of the 36 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were scored as positive for MYC translocation and this included 16 of the 20 patients in whom classic cytogenetics had shown the presence of the (8;14) translocation (or one of its two variants) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this two-colour "split-signal" technique based on breakpoint flanking probes can readily detect chromosomal translocations in paraffin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results suggest that cases categorized as "atypical Burkitt's/Burkitt-like" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (at least for adult patients) are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> with respect to translocations involving the MYC oncogene, as well as immunophenotype and clinical features </plain></SENT>
