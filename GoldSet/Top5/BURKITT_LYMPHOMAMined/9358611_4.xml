<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) consists of cell surface IgM associated with the CD79 alpha/beta heterodimer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper we describe a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognising the extracellular regions of human CD79 alpha and beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FACS analysis demonstrated that the mAbs bind to a range of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, a mouse B-cell line (JO-72) transfected with human CD79 alpha and beta, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> biopsies from NHL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the mAbs was confirmed by immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Ka for the binding of IgG from the anti-CD79 alpha mAbs to cell surface CD79 alpha on Ramos cells was 3 x 10(8) M-1, and their maximum level of binding, 1.7-2 x 10(5) molecules/cell, matched that obtained with anti-Fc mu and anti-Fd mu mAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four anti-CD79 beta mAbs were of lower affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> studies, we found that while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> anti-Fc mu mAbs caused profound inhibition of proliferation of Ramos cells, a range of other anti-BCR mAbs, which included the anti-CD79, anti-Fab mu, anti-gamma and anti-idiotype reagents, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> performed poorly giving a maximum of 25% inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences in performance are believed to relate to the ability of anti-BCR mAbs to cross-link neighbouring surface BCR and suggest that, unlike anti-Fc mu which favours cross-linking, most of these mAbs are binding in a monogamous, non-cross-linking, union with the BCR </plain></SENT>
