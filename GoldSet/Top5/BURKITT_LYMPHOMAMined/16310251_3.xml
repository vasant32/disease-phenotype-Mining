<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Burkitt-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) is a germinal centre derived B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presumably deregulation of the somatic hypermutation- and/or class switch recombination process causes a translocation between the myc-locus and one of the Ig-loci, which is characteristic for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show here that we developed an episomal-based vector system to monitor and induce AID-dependent somatic hypermutation in human cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exemplarily, we utilized this system to investigate the hypermutation status of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the influence of Ig-specific cis-regulatory elements for the mutability of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter transgene revealed, that the presence of Ig-enhancers is required for an efficient targeting of a constitutively transcribed GFP transgene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a transcriptional inducible GFP transgene was hypermutated by overexpression of activation-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase (AID), even in the absence of Ig-specific sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This observation verifies that overexpression of AID in non hypermutating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines as well as the expression of endogenous AID in the hypermutating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line Raji can overcome the target restriction of AID </plain></SENT>
