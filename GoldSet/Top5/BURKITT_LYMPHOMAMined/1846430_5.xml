<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of HMBA on cell growth and replication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus (HSV) was investigated in HEp-2 epidermal cells, IMR-32 neuronal cells, K562 myeloid cells, Daudi Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, and CCRF-CEM T-lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The growth of HEp-2 and IMR-32 cells was not affected by HMBA at concentrations from 0.5 through 2 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The growth of K562, Daudi, and CCRF-CEM cells was inhibited by HMBA at concentrations from 1 through 5 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When HSV-infected cells were incubated with 0.5 through 5 mM HMBA, a dose-dependent increase in virus yield was observed in HEp-2 and IMR-32 cells, but not in the other cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that HMBA enhances the replication of HSV in epidermal and neuronal cells and that HMBA therapy may be responsible for the development of herpetic lesions </plain></SENT>
