<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority were between the ages of 3 and 5 years and the male:female ratio was 2.75:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over half of the patients presented with abdominal masses, about half with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo> and a third with skull nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> was correctly made on admission in only five instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mainstay of treatment was chemotherapy and the outcome was uniformly poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one patient attended follow-up for as long as 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the present study, the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> ranks third, after Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e>, amongst malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0279068" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood solid tumours</z:e> encountered in the paediatric unit of Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The low index of suspicion and poor diagnostic facilities might, however, have contributed to the low reported incidence, late diagnosis and poor survival rates of children with this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
