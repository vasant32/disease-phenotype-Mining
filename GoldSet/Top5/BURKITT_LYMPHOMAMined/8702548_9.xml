<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Anti-IgM treatment of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells is followed by either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> or induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we have explored the role of c-myc in these events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results in Ramos cells indicate the following </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(a) The decline in c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> occurs at about 4 h; inhibition of about 80% being observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(b) The stability of c-myc message is involved since the half-life of c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is decreased from about 30 min in untreated cells to about 15 min following treatment with anti-IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48001">protein synthesis inhibitor</z:chebi>, the half-life is increased to about 50 min and was unaltered by treatment with anti-IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(c) By contrast, nuclear run-on experiments indicated no change in transcription rates for c-myc message due to treatment with anti-IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(d) A decrease in c-myc causes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> since specific repression of c-myc with antisense oligonucleotides decreases the levels of c-Myc, inhibits growth rate, decreases viability, and induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(e) Anti-CD40 inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> occurs without alteration in anti-IgM-induced down-regulation of c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, suggesting that it acts distally to c-myc down-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other cell lines were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive cell lines (Daudi, Raji, and Namalwa), anti-IgM treatment for 24 h results in growth inhibition without induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In EBV-negative cell lines (ST486 and CA46, as well as Ramos), a more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pattern of responses to anti-IgM are observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ramos and ST486 cells both show growth inhibition and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> upon anti-IgM treatment; CA46 cells shown only growth inhibition but not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Anti-IgM causes a decline in c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these lines, as well as in c-Myc protein level in the two lines investigated, Daudi and Ramos, regardless of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Addition of antisense c-myc oligonucleotides to the cells reduced growth in both Daudi and Ramos cells lines, however it resulted in substantial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> only in Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that anti-IgM destabilizes c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> by a process that involves <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> turnover, rather than transcription rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However anti-IgM exerts differential effects in EBV-positive and EBV-negative cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>EBV-positive cells are uniformly resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, while EBV-negative cell lines show a tendency to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> but with exceptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Growth inhibition can be uncoupled from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in EBV-positive cell lines, but not in those EBV-negative cell lines prone to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, down-regulation of c-myc message correlates with growth inhibition in these cells, but is an insufficient link to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>By contrast inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by anti-CD40 occurs even though c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is decreased </plain></SENT>
