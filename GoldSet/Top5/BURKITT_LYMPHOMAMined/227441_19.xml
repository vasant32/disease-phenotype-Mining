<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A deoxyribonuclease activity from Epstein--Barr (EB) virus producer lymphocyte cell lines which is correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> production and which is not present in virus non-producer or negative lymphocyte cell lines has been purified 220-fold with 20% recovery and characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This nuclease copurifies through diethylaminoethylcellulose column chromatography with the EB virus induced <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (DNA) polymerase in EB virus producer cells which was recently reported by this laboratory, but elutes as a separate peak of activity upon phosphocellulose chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This nuclease activity has a sedimentation coefficient of 4.0 S, a strong divalent cation requirement, an alkaline pH optimum, and the ability to utilize both native and denatured lymphocyte DNA as substrate, reducing both to monophosphonucleosides </plain></SENT>
