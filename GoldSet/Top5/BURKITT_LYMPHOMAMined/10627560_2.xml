<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that intracellular forms of NOTCH1 transactivate two major Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent promoters, the LMP1 and Cp1 promoters in an EBV-negative B-cell line, BJAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Truncated intracellular NOTCH1 associated with the nuclear membrane (DeltaE) transactivates the LMP1 promoter fivefold; however, the intranucleus localized form of NOTCH1 (ICN) transactivates this promoter approximately twofold in chloroamphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter assays in BJAB cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, DeltaE activated the major Cp1 promoter 12-fold, whereas the ICN form of NOTCH1 activates at only about half that level when compared to that of DeltaE membrane-bound NOTCH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This result differs from previously observed data, where intracellular NOTCH1 bound to the nuclear membrane, DeltaE, and nucleus-localized NOTCH1, ICN, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had similar levels of activation in 293 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests distinct transcriptional activities in different cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in Jurkat cells, a T-cell line, intranucleus localized NOTCH1 molecules demonstrated a repressive activity against the two EBV major latent promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only DeltaE activated the Cp1 and LMP1 promoters at a level slightly above background, whereas intranucleus localized NOTCH1 ICN, or the form of NOTCH1 lacking the ankyrin repeats, DeltaE(TAR), surprisingly resulted in the repression of these promoters in Jurkat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, another truncated form of NOTCH1, referred to as ICNW, which contains the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32732">tryptophan residue</z:chebi> W(1767) within one of the RBP-Jkappa interacting domains, repressed the LMP1 promoter approximately twofold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of the truncated NOTCH1 molecules on the LMP1 promoter element, lacking the two RBP-Jkappa binding sites, suggests that repression in Jurkat cells may be affected by the presence of the two RBP-Jkappa binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that intracellular NOTCH1 can activate the EBV major latent promoters in BJAB cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in Jurkat cells, intracellular truncated forms of NOTCH1 lacking the RBP-Jkappa binding sites repress these EBV latent promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only the membrane-bound form of NOTCH1, DeltaE, activated the EBV major latent promoters in Jurkat cells, albeit at a lower level than that seen in BJAB cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that EBNA2 and truncated intracellular nuclear localized forms of NOTCH1 may be functionally similar in their interactions with RBP-Jkappa; however, these molecules may have distinctly different transcriptional partners in BJAB and Jurkat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these truncated NOTCH1 molecules may not represent the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> processed forms of NOTCH1 in cells and may exhibit dominant negative phenotypes in the absence of the required posttranslational modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further investigations are necessary to determine the similarity and differences occurring with intracellular NOTCH1 in other B- and T-cell lines </plain></SENT>
