<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>Pleural effusions</z:hpo> were common, and 2 patients had pulmonary nodules </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mandibles and other bones were not affected in any of the 9 patients tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first 2 patients survived 0.5 to 8.5 months; the last 2 were treated much more aggressively and were still free of disease at the time this paper was written, 14 and 16 months after treatment, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hopefully, early recognition of the clinical and roentgenographic features of American Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> will contribute to improved survival </plain></SENT>
