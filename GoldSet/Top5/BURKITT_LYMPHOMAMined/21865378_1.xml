<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An ordered silencing of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency gene transcription is critical for establishment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1264606" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent infection</z:e> within B lymphocytes, yet the mechanisms responsible and the role that the virus itself may play are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe two B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> models with which to address these problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells that maintain latency I, when superinfected, initially supported transcription from the common EBNA promoters Wp and Cp (latency III) but ultimately transitioned to latency I (Cp/Wp silent), an essential requirement for establishment of EBV latency in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used this model to test whether the early lytic-cycle gene BHLF1, implicated in silencing of the Cp/Wp locus, is required to establish latency I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> with EBV deleted for the BHLF1 locus, however, we have demonstrated that BHLF1 is not essential for this aspect of EBV latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second model, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells that maintain Wp-restricted latency, a variant program in which Cp is silent but Wp remains active, sustained the latency III program of transcription from the superinfecting-virus genomes, failing to transition to latency I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, there was substantial reduction in Wp-mediated protein expression from endogenous EBV genomes, in the absence of Cp reactivation, that could occur independent of a parallel decrease in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data provide evidence of a novel, potentially posttranscriptional mechanism for trans-repression of Wp-dependent gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this may ensure against overexpression of the EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs) prior to the transcriptional repression of Wp in cis that occurs upon activation of Cp </plain></SENT>
