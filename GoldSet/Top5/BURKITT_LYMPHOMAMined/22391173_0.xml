<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Morphology</z:mp>, immunophenotype, cytogenetics and molecular biology (MICM) methods were applied to diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the two cases were both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> L3 type according to FAB criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetic technique or interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated that t(8;14) and t(14;18) were detected concurrently in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD20, CD10, FMC7, CD38 and CD19 were expressed in both patients by immunophenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to MICM, they were both diagnosed as Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first patient died in one month after chemotherapy, and the second patient survived 19 months after rituximab- combined high-dose chemotherapy and subsequently allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, t(8;14) and t(14;18) may present simultaneously in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and indicate poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rituximab-combined chemotherapy and subsequently HSCT could improve the outcomes of such cases </plain></SENT>
