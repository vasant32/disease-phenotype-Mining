<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show here that differentiation induction (with either <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, 12-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="45127">phorbol-13-acetate</z:chebi>, or teleocidin) or recombinant alpha- or gamma-interferon (IFN) treatment resulted in the augmentation of HLA class-I antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This augmentation of HLA class-I antigens was also observed in the Burkitt X K562 hybrid cells PUTKO and DUTKO (the latter coming from two presumably HLA-A, B-negative parents) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA class-I genes are thus functional in K562 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this system, alpha- and gamma-IFN had no clear differentiating capacity, since they were not able to modulate the expression of various hematopoietic markers, as chemical differentiation inducers did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, neither differentiation induction nor interferon treatment could induce HLA class-II antigen expression on K562 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These molecules could be very faintly induced in PUTKO and DUTKO hybrids, in contrast with strong HLA class-II expression on the B parental lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whether these results are due to "lineage infidelity" in K562 cells or whether K562 cells represent the proliferation of HLA class-I-positive class-II-negative hematopoietic cells, with active suppression of HLA class-II antigen expression, is discussed </plain></SENT>
