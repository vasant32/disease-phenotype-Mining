<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on a 59-year-old female diagnosed with minimally differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (M0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis demonstrated both a 7q deletion and a t(8;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies confirmed MYC/IGH fusion in 35% of nuclei, but the translocation was atypical due to lack of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such an atypical fusion has never been reported, so the effect on MYC regulation due to proximity of IGH regulatory elements is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated no increase in MYC expression (P = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that this novel translocation does not result in dysregulation of MYC expression, so this is likely to be a coincidental, benign finding in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is yet another example of a classic cytogenetic abnormality observed on conventional chromosome analysis which has no functional significance </plain></SENT>
