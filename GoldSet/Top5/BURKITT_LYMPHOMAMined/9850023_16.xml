<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e>) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> with morphologic features intermediate between Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but its relationship with these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is currently unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have therefore analyzed its characteristics within a large series of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV)-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical, histologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular analyses were performed on 103 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen cases (18.4%) were identified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were monoclonal B-cell proliferations, as evaluated by immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement analyses, and had rearrangement of the c-myc oncogene in 68% of cases but not the bcl-2 gene, in contrast to a previous study on non-HIV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This molecular pattern was therefore identical to that of typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, suggesting that they represented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of similar origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, some features could clearly differentiate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and were similar to those seen in the diffuse large-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLC-IBL) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These included a greater frequency of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (79% v 48%, P = .04), an upregulation of CD39 (50% v 0%, P = .0007) and CD70 (75% v 15%, P = .003) activation antigens and of the CD11a/LFA-1 adhesion molecule (83% v30%, P = .05), and, finally, a lower CD4 count (mean, 119/microL v 270/microL, P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e> is a frequent entity among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and should be considered as a morphologic variant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in the context of severe immunodepression that occurs in HIV-infected patients </plain></SENT>
