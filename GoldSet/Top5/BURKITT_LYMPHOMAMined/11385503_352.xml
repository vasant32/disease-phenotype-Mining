<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to develop a method of classifying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> to specific diagnostic categories based on their gene expression signatures using artificial neural networks (ANNs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We trained the ANNs using the small, round blue-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (SRBCTs) as a model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> belong to four distinct diagnostic categories and often present diagnostic dilemmas in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ANNs correctly classified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples and identified the genes most relevant to the classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of several of these genes has been reported in SRBCTs, but most have not been associated with these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To test the ability of the trained ANN models to recognize SRBCTs, we analyzed additional blinded samples that were not previously used for the training procedure, and correctly classified them in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the potential applications of these methods for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diagnosis and the identification of candidate targets for therapy </plain></SENT>
