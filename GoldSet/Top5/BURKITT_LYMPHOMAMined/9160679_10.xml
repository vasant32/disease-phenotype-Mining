<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used a stroma-supported culture method to study the prevalence and growth characteristics of malignant stem cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 51 of 108 B-lineage ALL samples, bone marrow-derived stroma not only inhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of ALL cells but also supported their proliferation in serum-free medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When single leukemic cells were placed in the stroma-coated wells of microtiter plates, the percentage of wells with leukemic cell growth after 2 to 5 months of culture ranged from 6% to 20% (median, 15%; 5 experiments) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotypes and genetic features of cells recovered from these cultures were identical to those noted before culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cells maintained their stroma dependency and self-renewal capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leukemic clones derived from single cells contained approximately 10(3) to 10(6) cells after 1 month of culture; other clones became detectable only after prolonged culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell growth in stroma-coated wells correlated with the number of initially seeded cells (1 or 10; r = .87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the observed percentages of positive wells seeded with 10 cells always exceeded values predicted from results with single-cell-initiated cultures (P &lt; .003 by paired t-test), suggesting stimulation of leukemic cell growth by paracrine factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the proportion of ALL cells with clonogenic potential may be considerably higher than previously thought </plain></SENT>
