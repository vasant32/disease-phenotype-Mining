<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The in vivo effect of transferrin and lactoferrin on the biodistribution of 67Ga was studied in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice bearing human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100001'>malignant mesothelioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Liver uptake of 67Ga, however, was significantly increased by binding to lactoferrin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of the significant amount of nonspecific binding of 67Ga-labeled <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> complexes in cell culture experiments, in vitro experiments should be used with caution in developing a hypothesis on the mechanisms of cellular uptake of radiogallium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo experiments suggest different mechanisms for cellular uptake of 67Ga in neoplastic tissue and in liver </plain></SENT>
