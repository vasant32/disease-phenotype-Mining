<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) plays a broad role in gene regulation, but it is not evident whether NF-kappa B acts as a messenger system for germline C epsilon transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here that the signaling cascade triggered by interleukin-4 (IL-4) or anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb) participates in NF-kappa B activation responsible for germline C epsilon transcription in a human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cell line, DND39 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both IL-4 and anti-CD40 mAb induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), translocation of a zeta isoform of protein kinase C, and nuclear expression of NF-kappa B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> such events were abrogated by treatment with LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3-kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetyl-L-cysteine</z:chebi> (NAC), a potent <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, decreased NF-kappa B activation caused by IL-4, anti-CD40 mAb, or their combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NAC was also effective in diminishing germline C epsilon transcription, and its potency was higher in cultures costimulated with IL-4 and anti-CD40 mAb than in those stimulated with IL-4 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that IL-4 and ligation of CD40 induce NF-kappa B expression via at least a mechanism dependent on the PI3-kinase pathway and suggest that NF-kappa B sensitive to NAC may play a role in regulating germline C epsilon transcription </plain></SENT>
