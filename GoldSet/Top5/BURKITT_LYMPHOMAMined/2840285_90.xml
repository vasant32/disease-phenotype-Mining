<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only a few <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes are expressed during latency and these apparently maintain cell immortalization by EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 1.9 kb cDNA clone of an EBV <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> has been isolated from a B95-8 cDNA library and this cDNA corresponds to a new member of the group of EBV latent cycle genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On Northern blots two polyadenylated transcripts 1.7 and 2.0 kb in length have been detected by the cDNA clone in B95-8 cells as well as in latently infected cell lines and in various cell lines derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cDNA sequence showed that this gene consists of nine exons and showed that this gene consists of nine exons and that the transcription unit crosses the terminal repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the intact gene is created upon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by the circularization of the linear <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA molecule at the terminal repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One major open reading frame is present in the cDNA apparently coding for a 53 kd protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A strongly hydrophilic part of the protein is followed by a very hydrophobic C-terminus, perhaps suggesting a membrane protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The gene is unrelated to the other latent cycle genes, the EBV nuclear antigens (EBNA 1-4), the leader protein (LP), and the latent membrane protein (LMP) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first example of a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene whose coding sequence is only created by joining of the ends of a linear virus </plain></SENT>
