<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primers were designed to amplify sequences within the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) 1 and 2 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These analyses detected the EBNA1 sequence in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the biopsies studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional sets of primers directed against the EBNA2 gene were used in order to categorize the EBV strains as A-type or B-type (39% A-type; 50% B-type; 5% A- and B-type; 5% untypeable) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that DNA sequence <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> within the EBNA2 gene region may exist in different strains of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extent of DNA sequence <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among different strains of EBV was determined by sequencing of a region within the EBNA2 gene in a number of different A-type and B-type strains of EBV originating from Africa or New Guinea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated DNA sequence <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> within the EBNA2 gene in different strains of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was more extensive among A-type strains than B-type strains of EBV </plain></SENT>
