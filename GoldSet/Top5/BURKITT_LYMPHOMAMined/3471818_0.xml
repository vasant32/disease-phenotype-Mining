<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Malignant T and B lymphocytes were relatively more sensitive than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T lymphocytes to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and Adriamycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since no plateau was observed in the clone survival with associated increasing drug concentration, spontaneous mutants could not be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the resistance to "natural product" drugs such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> arises from induced mutations and not from the selection of already existing spontaneous mutants </plain></SENT>
