<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were judged to have developed icteric or anicteric post-transfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo>, an incidence of 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five were icteric and four of these were <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B antigen (HB Ag) positive; two of these four died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the fatal cases and one non-fatal HB Ag positive case had received HB Ag positive blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two other antigen-positive patients had received blood or plasma or both which had not been tested for antigen.Thirty-five patients showed conspicuous or sustained elevations of alanine transaminase without clinical features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>.Four were positive for HB Ag but had not received antigen positive blood.Two who had received antigen positive blood remained antigen negative, but one developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B antibody (HB Ab).Two other patients were also transfused with plasma.Five had serological evidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> accompanying the enzyme changes.One patient who had received HB Ag positive blood remained antigen-negative and showed no abnormalities.Five patients who became HB Ag positive, although they had been given antigen-negative blood, remained clinically and biochemically well.Cytomegalovirus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary infection</z:e> or reactivation occurred in another 32 patients; five had isolated, transient enzyme rises, one other was associated with a drug-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001656'>focal liver necrosis</z:mp> and 26 showed no enzyme changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epstein-Barr virus infections</z:e>, one of which was associated with a transient upset of enzyme activity, were detected in five patients </plain></SENT>
