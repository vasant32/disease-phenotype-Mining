<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Au nanoparticles (NPs) bifunctionalized with aptamers and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50832,50833,50835">CdS</z:chebi> NPs were used for electrochemical signal amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The anodic stripping voltammetry technology employed for the analysis of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="22977">cadmium</z:chebi> ions dissolved from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50832,50833,50835">CdS</z:chebi> NPs on the aggregates provided a means to quantify the amount of the target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This electrochemical method could respond down to 67 cancer cells per mL with a linear calibration range from 1.0×10(2) to 1.0×10(5) cells mL(-1), which shows very high sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the assay was able to differentiate between target and control cells based on the aptamer used in the assay, indicating the wide applicability of the assay for diseased cell detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ECL detection was also performed by functionalizing the signal DNA, which was complementary to the aptamer of the Ramos cells, with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">tris</z:chebi>(2,2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35545">bipyridyl</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30682">ruthenium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ECL intensity of the signal DNA, replaced by the target cells from the ECL probes, directly reflected the quantity of the amount of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the use of the developed ECL probe, a limit of detection as low as 89 Ramos cells per mL could be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proposed methods based on electrochemical and ECL should have wide applications in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> due to their high sensitivity, simplicity, and low cost </plain></SENT>
