<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the clinical utility of assays for the plasmocyte activation antigen CD38 (T10) and the thymocyte activation antigen CD71 (transferrin receptor; T9) in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), we reviewed the presenting features and clinical outcomes of 325 ALL patients treated on a single protocol at St Jude Children's Research Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T-cell ALL cases were more likely than B-lineage ALL cases to express CD38 (100% versus 90.5%, p &lt; 0.01) and CD71 (92% versus 32%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, expression of these antigens was not related to any clinical or biologic feature within the immunophenotypic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More importantly, event-free survival did not differ significantly between CD38+ and CD38- cases or between CD71+ and CD71- cases in the study group as a whole or in immunophenotypic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies of CD38 and CD71 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> provide no clinically useful information beyond that obtained from standard immunophenotyping studies </plain></SENT>
