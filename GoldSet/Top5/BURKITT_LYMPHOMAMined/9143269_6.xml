<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A multifunctional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule CD44 partially mediates binding of lymphocytes to the white matter by interacting with hyaluronate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To analyze which forms of CD44 and what other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules mediate this binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Namalwa cells were transfected to express either standard (CD44st) or variant isoforms of CD44 containing exons v6-v10, v7-v10, and v8-v10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The binding of CD44st and CD44v6-v10 transfectants to human cerebellar white matter was tested and it was about 1.7- and 2-fold greater without and with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> activation, respectively, compared with vector-transfected control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hyaluronidase digestion of tissue sections decreased binding of CD44 expressing cells to the level of vector-transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hermes-1, a monoclonal antibody recognizing the hyaluronate binding site of CD44, inhibited white matter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of CD44v6-v10 and activated CD44st cells and binding of soluble hyaluronate to the CD44 transfectants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transfectants also expressed beta 1, beta 2 and beta 7 integrins and L-selectin, but antibodies against these molecules did not inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest: (a) Addition of exons v6-v10 to the membrane proximal region of CD44 does not affect lymphoid cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to the white matter </plain></SENT>
