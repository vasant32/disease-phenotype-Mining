<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By light microscopy, these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are indistinguishable from Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> of bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, the salient features are also comparable to Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> of bone and include: 1) absence of surface modifications; 2) cell-contact sites in the form of small thickenings of apposed membranes and large desmosome-like specializations; 3) undifferentiated cytoplasm usually containing abundant <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> and occasionally nonspecific microfilaments; 4) significant variation in shape and irregularity of nuclear profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructural features of extraskeletal Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> are sufficiently distinctive to allow separation from from other small-cell malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
