<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subclones of the human JK-CK region were then used to characterize and clone the rearranged K genes of the lymphoid cell lines Walker and Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Walker cell line contains one rearranged and one germline K allele (K+,KO; ref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one K gene was found in Daudi cells (K+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Restriction mapping and DNA sequencing showed, that the rearranged K genes from both cell lines are closely related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These features make the two cell lines particularly suitable for studies on the chromatin structure of K light chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5' flanks of the two genes (388 bp) are identical while there is a 12% divergence between the VK gene segments themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This situation may reflect <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> processes and/or gene conversion like events </plain></SENT>
