<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the well-known causes of genome instability is telomere dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the condition of telomeres was analyzed in the cell lines and clinical samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Telomere length (TL) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> cell lines was extremely short (&lt;4.5 kbp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples was broad in range, and shorter than that in the peripheral blood leukocytes from the matched patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> cell lines showed frequent loss of telomere signals (telomere <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath>); however, telomerase activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> cell lines was similar to that in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rb expression was detected in three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> cell lines and four of 15 clinical samples, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rb protein expressed in three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> cell lines was heavily phosphorylated, indicating that function of Rb protein was suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>p16(INK4a) expression was not detected in either cell lines or clinical samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The promoter region in p16(INK4a) was heavily methylated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines as well as the clinical samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inactivation of the p16(INK4a)/Rb pathway may allow continuous cell division and critical telomere shortening, which induce genome instability, finally leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, telomere dysfunction and inactivation of the p16(INK4a)/Rb pathway might play a role for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
