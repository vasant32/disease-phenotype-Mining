<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the ability of the anti-CD20 antibody, Rituximab (RTX), to inhibit the activity of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (P-gp), and reverse multidrug resistance (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>) in 2 P-gp/CD20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined whether RTX would chemosensitize the 2 P-gp cell lines in vitro, and inhibit the ability of the cells to efflux <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">Rhodamine 123</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One cell line was infected with an MDR1 vector and the other was generated by drug selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also determined whether RTX induced P-gp to translocate out of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RTX chemosensitized 2 different <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> cell lines, inhibited the activity of P-gp in both, and induced P-gp to translocate out of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts in the 1 cell line that was studied in greater detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 3 other anti-CD20 antibodies did not chemosensitize, inhibit the activity of P-gp, or induce it to translocate out of rafts, despite the fact that 1 antibody recognized the same <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> on CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that RTX can chemosensitize 2 CD20/P-gp cell lines in vitro by inhibiting the activity of the P-gp pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of P-gp activity correlated with the ability of RTX to induce P-gp to translocate out of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanisms by which RTX effects P-gp translocation and activity are not yet known, they are not associated with acid-sphingomyelinase activation in raft microdomains, as described for the antiproliferative activity of RTX </plain></SENT>
