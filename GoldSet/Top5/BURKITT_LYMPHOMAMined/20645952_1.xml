<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumour lysis syndrome</z:e> that developed postoperatively in a patient with undiagnosed Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The former diagnosis was made, unusually, following the development of white emulsion-like urine in the catheter bag whilst the patient was being managed in the intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After laboratory analysis, the urine was found to contain large quantities of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> crystals which were the key to the prompt diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumour lysis syndrome</z:e> is rare and this case highlights the difficulties in making an early diagnosis when the presence of a predisposing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> has not yet been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumour lysis syndrome</z:e> can be fatal due to severe biochemical disturbances causing cardiac dysfunction and multi-organ failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early recognition and treatment are crucial to prevent morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The unusual presentation of this case in association with an undiagnosed Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> emphasises how vigilant anaesthetists and intensivists must be in recognising this potentially life-threatening condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe that the triggering factor in this case was laparotomy and handling of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
