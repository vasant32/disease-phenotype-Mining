<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The tendency of isolated germinal center (GC) B cells to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was suppressed by recombinant cell-bound CD40 ligand (CD40L): after 2 days at 37 degrees C, &gt; 80% of cells remained viable in the presence of CD40L as compared to &lt; 1% in control cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD40L sustained a high rate of DNA synthesis in GC cells and was more effective than monoclonal antibody to CD40 in this regard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group I Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines induced to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> with anti-immunoglobulin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> were also protected by CD40L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, this route of rescue was not accompanied by induction of Bc1-2 protein, the expression of which has been linked to hemopoietic cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bc1-2 was induced in GC cells responding to CD40L, but its appearance was a relatively late event not reaching significant levels over controls until day 2 of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus induction of Bc1-2 appears to be secondary to the survival signal imparted by CD40L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings are discussed in relation to a potential role for CD40L in supporting B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in vivo and the discovery that the molecular defect in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyper-IgM syndrome</z:e> is targeted to the CD40L gene </plain></SENT>
