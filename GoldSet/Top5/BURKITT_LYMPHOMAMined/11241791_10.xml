<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied a stratified cohort of 51 childhood B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALLs</z:e>) to evaluate the efficiency of spectral karyotyping (SKY) in the detection of chromosome aberrations previously diagnosed using chromosome banding and/or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the small number of cases analyzed, several important features emerge from the study: (a) The result of banding analysis was revised in two-thirds of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three chromosome anomalies previously undetected or not characterized using chromosome banding were identified by spectral karyotyping, even in patients with apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(b) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> hyperdiploidy cases showed one or more extra copies of chromosomes X, 14, and 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(c) Two hidden rearrangements, a t(7;12)(?p12;p13), and a new translocation, a t(9;12)(q31;p13), both involving the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene, were characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(d) Some cryptic rearrangements, such as the der(21) t(12;21) translocation, remained undetected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(e) No new recurrent chromosome anomalies were discovered with this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study confirms the efficiency of the SKY technique in resolving and characterizing many complex chromosome anomalies seen in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALLs</z:e>, but it raises questions about the ability of this technique to detect cryptic rearrangements, such as the t(12;21) translocation </plain></SENT>
