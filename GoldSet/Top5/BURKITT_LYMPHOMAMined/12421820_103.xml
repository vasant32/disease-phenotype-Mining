<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In response to DNA damage, the activity of the p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor is modulated by protein stabilization and post-translational modifications including acetylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, both acetylation and ubiquitination can modify the same lysine residues at the C terminus of p53, implicating a role of acetylation in the regulation of p53 stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the direct effect of acetylation on Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 is still lacking because of technical difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we have developed a method to obtain pure acetylated p53 proteins from cells, and by using an in vitro purified system, we provide the direct evidence that acetylation of the C-terminal domain is sufficient to abrogate its ubiquitination by Mdm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, even in the absence of DNA damage, acetylation of the p53 protein is capable of reducing the ubiquitination levels and extending its half-life in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we also show that acetylation of p53 can affect its ubiquitination through other mechanisms in addition to the site competition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study has significant implications regarding a general mechanism by which protein acetylation modulates ubiquitination-dependent proteasome proteolysis </plain></SENT>
