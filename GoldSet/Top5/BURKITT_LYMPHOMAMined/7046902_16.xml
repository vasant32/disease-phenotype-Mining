<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of the coagulation screening tests and decreased fibrinogen levels were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> of functional (mean 32%) and antigenic (mean 48%) antithrombin III were observed by day 14 of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no laboratory evidence of intravascular coagulation during 11/14 courses of L-asparaginase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of plasma obtained at the antithrombin nadir did not demonstrate an abnormal pattern which can be associated with an abnormal antithrombin III or an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">increase in antithrombin</z:e> III-coagulation factor complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major underlying mechanism of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is believed to be decreased hepatic synthesis, and the low levels of antithrombin III may be associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
