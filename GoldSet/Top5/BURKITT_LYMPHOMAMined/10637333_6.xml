<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the functional role of distinct kappa enhancer sequence motifs in P1 activation on both mini-chromosomes and reporter gene constructs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stable and transient transfections of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells revealed critical roles of the kappaEi and kappaE3' elements kappaB and PU, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Joint mutation of kappaB and PU completely abolished P1 activity, implying that an interaction of kappaB- and PU-binding factors is essential for the enhancer synergism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation of the E box 1 and E box 2 motifs markedly decreased P1 activity in transient but not in stable transfection experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Co-expression of the NF-kappaB subunit p65(RelA) and Sp1, an essential factor for P1 transcription, in Drosophila melanogaster SL2 cells synergistically enhanced promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results support a model which proposes cross-talk between promoter and enhancer binding factors as the basic mechanism for kappa enhancer-mediated c- myc activation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
