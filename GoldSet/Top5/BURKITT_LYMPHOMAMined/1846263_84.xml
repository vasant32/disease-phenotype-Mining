<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven cases (26 high-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [NHL], 1 Hodgkin's disease) were found, to give a cumulative incidence rate of 8% among Danish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphologically most NHL patients were classified into two groups: 1) high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a predominant population of immunoblasts, either monomorphic or more often polymorphic with plasmacytic differentiation; 2) Burkitt-type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 26 NHLs, 22 had a B-cell paraffin-section immunophenotype and 4 were non-B, non-T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA was demonstrated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells of 12 of 24 cases (50%) using in situ nucleic acid hybridization with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>-labeled probe in paraffin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus DNA was found in 65% of group 1 and 20% of group 2 tumors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study suggests the existence of two main groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with different pathogeneses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>First there are immunoblast-rich lesions, which usually are associated with EBV and morphologically resemble <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> described in immunosuppressed organ-transplantation patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Second there are Burkitt-type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in which EBV sequences are less common and that may be pathogenetically analogous to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
