<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of CD77 expressed on a fraction of germinal center B cells, also known as glycosphyngolipid Gb3, and as a functional receptor for Shiga toxins (Stx) in B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using Stx1-sensitive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Ramos cells as an in vitro model of CD77(+) germinal center B cells, intracellular signaling events mediated by either Stx1 or anti-CD77 antibody were examined immunobiochemically and immunocytologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed prompt activation of Lyn and Syk kinases leading to increased binding of these proteins to surface IgM (sIgM) in Ramos cells after Stx1 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also observed microscopic colocalization of CD77 and sIgM after stimulation with Stx1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Along with the synergism between the cross-linking of CD77 and that of sIgM in their effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction, it was highly probable that CD77 cross-linking induces activation of the BCR signaling cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis using <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> density gradient centrifugation suggested that Stx1 binding to CD77 induced recruitment and activation of Lyn in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi>-enriched membrane (GEM) fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Once activated, however, Lyn seemed to acquire an increased detergent solubility and moved outside of the GEM fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study describes the participation of the GEM domain in BCR-signaling cascade and suggests a possible role of CD77 as a regulator of BCR-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in human B cells </plain></SENT>
