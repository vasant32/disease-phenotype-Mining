<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study minimal disseminated disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e>) in children with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and to determine its impact on prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We established a simplified long-distance polymerase chain reaction (LD-PCR) assay that can amplify up to 15 to 20 Kb of DNA sequence, making it possible to detect the t(8;14) at the genomic level with sensitivity of 10(-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied diagnostic biopsies and bone marrow aspirates from 134 patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A specific LD-PCR product was detected in 96 (72%) of 134 BL biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 84 patients with t(8;14) positivity on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsy and bone marrow (BM), 26 (31%) had LD-PCR-positive BM, and 15 (18%) were positive at standard morphologic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty (85%) of 26 MDD-positive patients belonged to the R4 risk group, according to Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3-year progression-free survival was 68% (SE, 10%) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e>-positive patients in R4 compared with 93% (SE, 5%) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e>-negative patients in R4 (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis (including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e>, sex, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement), only <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> was predictive of higher risk of failure (hazard ratio, 4.7; P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> identifies a poor-prognosis subgroup among children with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To improve disease control in these patients, a more effective risk-adapted therapy, possibly including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, should be considered </plain></SENT>
