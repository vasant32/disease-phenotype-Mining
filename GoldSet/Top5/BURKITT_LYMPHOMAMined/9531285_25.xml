<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have compared the subunit composition and enzymatic activity of purified 26S proteasomes from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells and in vitro EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low expression of the IFN-gamma-regulated beta low molecular mass <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (Lmp)2, Lmp7, and MECL-1 was demonstrated in a panel of seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines that express the germinal center <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> of the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coexpression of Lmp2 and Lmp7 with the constitutively expressed subunits delta and MB1 was demonstrated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines by immunoprecipitation and two-dimensional gel fractionation of the 20S proteasomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coexpression of these subunits correlated with reduced levels of chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities detected by the cleavage of fluorogenic substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of Lmp2 and Lmp7 and decreased chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities were also observed in purified proteasomes from a c-myc-transfected subline of the ER/EB2-5 LCL that has adopted a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-like phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> analogue of the immunodominant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> from the EBV nuclear Ag 4 (E4416-424Y) was cleaved by proteasomes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> and A1, while proteasomes from LCLs were inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cleavage of the E4416-424Y <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was not affected by treatment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells with IFN-gamma despite both significant up-regulation of Lmp2 and Lmp7 and reconstitution of chymotrypsin and trypsin-like activities against fluorogenic substrates to LCL-like levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that B cell lines representing different stages of B cell activation and differentiation express proteasomes with different subunit compositions and enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This may result in the generation of a distinct set of endogenous <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and influence the immunogenicity of these cells </plain></SENT>
