<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using a temperature sensitive p53 construct (ts p53), we have earlier shown that expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (wt) p53 triggers <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a v-myc-induced T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line that lacks endogenous p53, and in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line that carries mutant p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have suggested that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is elicited by the contradictory signals emanating from the constitutively activated myc gene and the growth arresting signal of wt p53 (Ramqvist et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1993) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Work in other laboratories has shown that constitutive c-myc expression can induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> when cell proliferation is inhibited due to the lack of growth stimulating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of bcl-2 could inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to test whether p53-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> can be prevented by bcl-2, we have introduced a retrovirally driven bcl-2 construct into our v-myc-induced murine T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line, previously transfected with ts p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>About 90% of the parental ts p53 transfected cells died of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> within 3 days after induction of wt p53 expression at 32 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two clones of ts p53/bcl-2 double transfectants that expressed high levels of bcl-2 from the introduced construct were completely protected from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, following transfer of the cells to 32 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One clone that expressed the exogenous bcl-2 only at a low level was partially protected from wt p53-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clones of the parental ts p53 carrying cells transfected with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17939">puromycin</z:chebi> resistance gene vector, without the bcl-2 gene underwent 90% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that bcl-2 may prevent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in cells simultaneously exposed to the proliferation-stimulating effect of activated myc and the growth arresting signal of wt p53 </plain></SENT>
