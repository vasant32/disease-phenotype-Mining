<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Magnetic fields (MFs) of various characteristics can lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001050'>plethora</z:hpo> effects in biological system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From a molecular point of view, we hypothesized that there must be a fundamental difference in gene expression between the MF exposed and the unexposed cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify the classes of genes that are regulated, 0.8 mT 50 Hz MF-induced changes in gene expression were examined in a Daudi cell culture using differential display and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A candidate cDNA (signatured as MF-CB) that was observed in the sham-exposed but not in MF-exposed cultures was recovered and reamplified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After verification by Northern blot, the cDNA was cloned and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was found that 254-base pair of 5'-end MF-CB cDNA clone was identical to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">gcs</z:e> in open reading frame (ORF) range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the preliminarily sequence, the prolonged length of 5'-end MF-CB cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification and its sequence analysis showed the same results as its original fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In order to further determine whether MF-CB cDNA is from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">gcs</z:e>, two Northern blots were probed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">gcs</z:e> and MF-CB cDNA, respectively, and the data revealed signals of the same size and expression pattern on the two probe filters, which demonstrated that MF-CB is an EST (expression sequence tag) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">gcs</z:e>. <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">gcs</z:e> is a gene, identified recently (GenBank accession number D89866), encoding <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> glucosyltransferase (GCS), which has been implicated as a causal element in human cell growth and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In an additional experiment, time-dependent changes in the transcription of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">gcs</z:e> induced by 0.8 mT MF were observed by Northern blot with a sharp and reproducible inhibition effect after 20 min exposure and a reduction after 20-24 h exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study demonstrates for the first time that 50 Hz MF can lead to changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">gcs</z:e> transcription, which provides a new clue to elucidate the mechanism by which MF influence cell growth and differentiation </plain></SENT>
