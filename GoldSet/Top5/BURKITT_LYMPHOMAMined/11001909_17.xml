<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetics were performed in a single central laboratory, and the children were treated using a single Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clear differences between the karyotypic characteristics of B-lineage ALL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> were confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that there may be survival differences associated with some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> blast cell karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Better survival is associated with only <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes and with t(10;14) (translocation of chromosomes 10 and 14); worse survival is associated with the presence of any derivative chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two new recurring chromosome aberrations previously not reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> were found: del(1)(p22) and t(8;12)(q13;p13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten aberrations found in this series, which were reported only once previously in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>, can now be considered recurring abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 of these new recurring aberrations are targets for discovery and characterization of new genes that are important in T-cell development and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
