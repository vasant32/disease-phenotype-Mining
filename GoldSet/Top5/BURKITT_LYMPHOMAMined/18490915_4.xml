<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method and guidelines for its interpretation are very precise to avoid both false-negative and -positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a group of 21 patients following transplantation, we observed detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> positivities in Ig/TCR-based real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) leading to no further progression of the disease (11 of 100 (11%) total samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that these positivities were mostly the result of nonspecific amplification despite the application of strict internationally agreed-upon measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We applied two non-self-specific Ig heavy chain assays and received a similar number of positivities (20 and 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonspecific products amplified in these RQ-PCR systems differed from specific products in length and sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis proved that there was an excellent correlation of this phenomenon with B-cell regeneration in BM as measured by flow cytometry and Ig light chain-kappa excision circle quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that although Ig/TCR quantification is a reliable method for post transplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> detection, isolated positivities in Ig-based RQ-PCR systems at the time of intense B-cell regeneration must be viewed with caution to avoid the wrong indication of treatment </plain></SENT>
