<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should always be considered because it is an important cause of morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical utility of flow cytometry immunophenotyping (FCI) in diagnosing or discarding leptomeningeal involvement in HIV-infected patients and to compare its sensitivity with that of conventional cytological methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-six cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 29 HIV-infected patients were independently evaluated by flow cytometry and cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The description of an aberrant immunophenotype was the criterion used to define the malignant nature of any CSF cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FCI and cytology gave concordant results for 48 of the 56 CSF samples studied: 37 were negative for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and 11 had evidence of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discordant results were obtained for eight CSF samples, and the accuracy of the FCI findings could be demonstrated for four CSF samples described as positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> according to the FCI criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high level of agreement was found between the results obtained using the two methods, but FCI gave at least 25% higher sensitivity than conventional cytomorphological methods for the detection of malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This advantage suggests that, in case of negative flow cytometry results, disorders other than non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should be strongly considered </plain></SENT>
