<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to elucidate the effect of ethnicity on subtype frequency of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and EBV association rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 232 reconfirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases in Malaysian patients were retrieved from the archives in the Department of Pathology, University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 24 (10%) Hodgkin's and 208 (90%) non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 173 of the latter were in adult group (aged &gt; or = 15 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ethnic composition were 41 Malays, 107 Chinese, 21 Indians and four none of the above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A male : female ratio of 2.4 : 1 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete immunohistochemical studies in 158 cases revealed 36 (23%) T-cell, 121 (76%) B-cell and one (1%) null-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five percent of the T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were peripheral T/NK-cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the classifiable lesions, low-grade/indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> constituted 17%: 2% were the lymphocytic subtype and 10% were follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-third of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> occurred in Indian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The largest group of high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was diffuse large B-cell type (46%), followed by peripheral T/NK-cell (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A predominance of NK/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> occurred in Chinese (5/7), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were EBV associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> accounted for 5% (eight cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were Chinese males, with a 38% EBV-association rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The frequency of EBV-associated B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is three times more common in Chinese than Malays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The EBV positivity rate among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in ethnic Malay, Chinese and Indian patients was 5%, 15% and 22%, respectively, and in T- and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was 36% and 7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This Malaysian series reveals differences in the subtype frequencies of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and EBV association rate amongst patients of various ethnic groups residing in the same environment </plain></SENT>
