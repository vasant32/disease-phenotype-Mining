<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, EBV-transformed B cell lines of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or neoplastic (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) origin also suppressed the PWM-induced immunoglobulin production of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell separation experiments have shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> activated autologous B cells stimulate suppressor T cells in a similar way as B cell-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The significance of this phenomenon is considered in relation to the escape of the activating microorganism or virus from immune control and the occurrence of network interactions within the immune system </plain></SENT>
