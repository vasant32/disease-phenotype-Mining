<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pronounced infiltration with murine (m)CD-11b-positive mouse macrophages and mCD-8a-positive mouse lymphoid cells, most probably natural killer cells, was seen in histological tissue sections of regressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 60 tumors when LCL cells were inoculated contralaterally </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating mouse cells can be activated at least by some human cytokines, we measured cytokine production of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 60 and IARC 277 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High amounts of IL 6 and IL 10 were produced by the LCL cells, whereas IL-6 and IL-10 production by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 60 cells was beyond or close to the detection threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, IL 8 was secreted up to 5-fold more by the LCL than by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results presented here thus suggest a host response of the <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse, which is triggered by cytokines released from the LCL but, once induced, is directed also against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
