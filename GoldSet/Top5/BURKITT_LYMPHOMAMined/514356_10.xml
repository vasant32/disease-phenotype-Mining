<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although buffy coat leukocytes have been the prime source of human interferon, cells of the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line Namalwa are increasingly used for the large scale production of interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On induction with Sendai virus or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Newcastle disease</z:e> virus, Namalwa cells produce a substantial quantity of interferon which contains predominantly the leukocyte antigenic species and minor amounts of fibroblast-type interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated that inducers of erythropoietic differentiation in Friend cells are able to enhance interferon synthesis in Namalwa cells when added to cultures larger than or equal to 24 h before interferon induction by Sendai virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most potent compounds, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi>, stimulated interferon production about 30-fold and has also been independelty described by others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> active compounds inhibited DNA synthesis in Namalwa cells and the extent of inhibition apparently paralleled the stimulatory potency of the respective compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction of differentiation of Friend cells can be antagonised by various steroid hormones, which by themselves have no measurable effects on these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we report here that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> hormones inhibit DNA synthesis in Namalwa cells and augment Sendai virus-induced interferon synthesis </plain></SENT>
