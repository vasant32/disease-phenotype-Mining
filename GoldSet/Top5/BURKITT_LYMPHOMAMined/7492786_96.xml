<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A search for rearrangement of the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> locus in the region known to be involved in t(12;21) was performed by Southern blotting in a panel of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of a t(12;21) was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report that fusion of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> to AML1 is specifically observed in at least 16% of the childhood B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) investigated, none of which had been previously identified as harboring t(12;21) </plain></SENT>
