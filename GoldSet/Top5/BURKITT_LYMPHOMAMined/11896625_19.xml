<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice in which the myc gene is juxtaposed to an immunoglobulin enhancer (E(mu)-myc) also develop B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but relatively late in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> are invariably clonal, suggesting the involvement of additional mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such mutations frequently affect the p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor gene or its positive regulator <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Arf</z:e>, hinting that inactivation of the p53 pathway might be the second hit required for the progression towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, even <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> arising in E(mu)-myc/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Arf</z:e>-null animals are thought to be clonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This observation raised doubts whether overexpression of Myc in p53-null B-cell precursors is sufficient for <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we have established a new, non-transgenic mouse model of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This model is based on isolation of primary bone marrow (BM) cells, admixing them with packaging cells producing a Myc-encoding retrovirus (LMycSN), and subcutaneous injection into a host with which BM cells are syngeneic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Predictably, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> BM cells infected in vivo by LMycSN were not tumorigenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, LMycSN-infected p53-null BM cells readily gave rise to B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> composed predominantly of late pro-B/small pre-B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, heavy chain gene rearrangements were analysed using two independent PCR-based assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with DJ-rearrangements were found to be polyclonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that inactivation of p53 and overexpression of Myc is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> that is necessary for the development of full-fledged B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our model would also be instrumental in assessing the transforming potential of Myc mutants and in studying cooperation between Myc and other oncogenes </plain></SENT>
