<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relative quantities of HLA antigens and beta(2)-microglobulin on the cultured cells were determined by quantitative immunofluorescence (fluorescence-activated cell sorter) and by the capacity of cells to absorb out cytotoxic antibodies against the relevant antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interferons of different origin and purities enhanced the expression of HLA antigens and beta(2)-microglobulins, whereas membrane immunoglobulins and antigens recognized by antiserum raised against human brain and T cells were the same on interferon-treated and control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar interferon effects were observed on an Epstein-Barrvirus-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enhanced expression of histocompatibility antigen subsequent to intereferon treatment was observed on B- and T-enriched lymphocyte populations and was found to be dose dependent with the optimum with "physiological" concentrations of interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of lymphocytes with interferon for 2 hr was found to be as effective as having interferon present during the total culture period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interferon-induced enhancement of antigen expression on cells was dependent on active protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
