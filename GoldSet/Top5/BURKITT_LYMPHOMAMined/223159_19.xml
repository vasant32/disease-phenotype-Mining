<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such DNA was cleaved in fragments (A-K) of molecular weights between 1 x 10(6) and 30 x 10(6) with restriction enzyme EcoRI, and these fragments were analyzed by standard methods involving <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, transfer to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53325">nitrocellulose</z:chebi> filters, and hybridization with radioactive EBV DNA or complementary <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequence variability among different EBV DNA isolates was largely confined to the A, C, and I fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results are discussed in relation to the linkage map of the EcoRI fragments of EBV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The EcoRI cleavage pattern of intracellular <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA of an EBV-like virus from baboon cells, Herpesvirus papio, was entirely different from that of human EBV isolates </plain></SENT>
