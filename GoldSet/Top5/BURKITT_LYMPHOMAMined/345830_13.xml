<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose was to define the criteria requisite for the ultrastructural diagnosis of large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fine structural features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were compared to those of similar appearing reticuloendothelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that may simulate large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two variants of large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were recognized, each composed of neoplastic lymphoid cells with the morphologic features of transformed lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The larger group represents large noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of Lukes and Collins' functional classification, while the second type corresponds to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of large cleaved cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructural features of large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are uniform and usually easily identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By utilizing diagnostic electron microscopy, large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can often be distinguished from similar appearing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> presenting as diagnostic problems at the light microscopic level </plain></SENT>
