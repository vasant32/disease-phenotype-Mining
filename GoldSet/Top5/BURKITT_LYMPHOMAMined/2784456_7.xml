<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The nature of CR type 2 (CR2)-ligand interactions which leads to the activation of human B cells was analyzed by using synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and CR2-positive cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The third component of C (C3) supported the growth of human lymphoblastoid B cells in serum-free medium containing human transferrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This effect was inhibited by an antibody to C3d (mAb 130) which specifically inhibits C3d binding to CR2, but not by other anti-C3 mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> corresponding to the CR2-binding site on C3d, P28 (residues 1187-1214) or multivalent P13 [1202-1214)4-template), supported the proliferative response of CR2-positive human lymphoblastoid lines in a similar way as C3 and this response could be inhibited by the anti-CR2 mAb OKB7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proliferative response to C3 or <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> was dose dependent and a 60-fold higher concentration of P28 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was required to induce the same level of proliferation as C3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This stimulation of growth was observed only on CR2 expressing cell lines Raji and Daudi, and not on the CR2-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Rael and the monocytic cell line U937 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the stimulatory effect of P28 and P13-template, monomeric P14 (1201-1214) was not able to support the growth of these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, however, inhibited the proliferative response of the CR2-positive lines to C3, P28, and multivalent-P13, thus indicating that cross-linking of the CR2 receptor is necessary for B cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, E12 (from <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (GP)350, the major EBV outer membrane GP) which shows a high degree of similarity with P14, also inhibited the proliferative response of Raji cells, suggesting that this segment on GP350 is involved in the interaction of EBV with CR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The possibility of using the above <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> as well as other <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> with "tailor-made" structure in studying the multifunctional role of C3 is discussed </plain></SENT>
