<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LMP1 signaling involves several cellular signaling intermediates, especially TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that LMP1 is highly concentrated in a cell fraction called <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi>-rich membrane complexes (GSL complexes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here that parallel accumulation of LMP1 and TRAF3, but not TRAF1 or TRADD, was observed in GSL complexes from lymphoblastoid and LMP1-positive NPC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TRAF3 was not concentrated in GSL complexes from LMP1-negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binding of LMP1 and TRAF3 in GSL complexes was demonstrated in lymphoblastoid and NPC cells, by co-immunoprecipitation with both anti-LMP1 and anti-TRAF3 antibodies </plain></SENT>
