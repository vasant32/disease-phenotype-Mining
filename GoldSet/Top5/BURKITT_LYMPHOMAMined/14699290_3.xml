<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The authors present a case of atypical Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with multiple epidural involvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>Spinal cord compression</z:hpo> in children is an emergency that requires urgent attention to minimize neurologic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although it is not life-threatening in most patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0266798,C0037926" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cord compression</z:e> can cause severe neurologic morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Because the patient showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0007307'>rapid neurologic deterioration</z:hpo>, we started chemotherapy and high-dose steroids without laminectomy or radiotherapy immediately after a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsy from the left mandible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The combined therapies were very effective and his neurologic symptoms improved immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The epidural involved masses disappeared in imaging studies after the first course of chemotherapy including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg per day for 3 consecutive days and gradually tapered off over 2 weeks), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> (1.5 mg/m2 per day), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (2 g/m2 per day for 2 days) and pirarubicin (40 mg/m2 per day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After completing seven courses of chemotherapy, the patient is now fully ambulant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Considering the severe late effects of laminectomy and radiotherapy, chemotherapy should be considered as a first choice of treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>spinal cord compression</z:hpo> caused by malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
