<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contribution of EBV antigens to the induction of cytotoxic responses was investigated by comparing CTL clones derived from allogeneic MLCs of lymphocytes from one EBV seropositive and one seronegative donor for their capacity to lyse paired EBV positive and negative targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of the clones showed a conventional "HLA-specific" cytotoxicity and lysed equally well HLA-matched LCLs and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-induced T- or B-blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A minority of the clones from both donors exhibited an "LCL-selective" killing potential as they lysed poorly T- and B-blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LCL-selective clones did not recognize EBV antigens because they could not discriminate between EBV negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) lines and their in vitro EBV-converted sublines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAbs to CD3, CD8, and MHC class I antigens blocked the lysis of LCLs by HLA-specific and LCL-selective CTLs with comparable efficiency suggesting that the two effector types express T-cell receptors of similar affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T-blasts were unable to inhibit the lysis of LCLs in cross competition assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This correlated with a significantly lower expression of the cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules ICAM-1 and LFA-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that stimulation with allogeneic LCLs activates HLA class I-specific CTLs with variable target cell avidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only CTLs that act independently of the enhancing effect of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules are able to lyse <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-induced T- and B-blasts </plain></SENT>
