<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to answer the question whether human lymphocytes and spleen cells were capable of de novo <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experiments were carried out in cell-free extracts prepared from human spleen, and from a cell line established from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and human spleen cells could synthesize the first and second intermediates of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> biosynthetic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell-free extracts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines studied contained the enzyme systems which catalyze the synthesis of phosphoribosyl-1-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi>, the first intermediate unique to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> biosynthetic pathway and of phosphoribosyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42843">glycinamide</z:chebi>, the second intermediate of this pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phosphoribosyl-1-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> could be synthesized in cell-free extracts from alpha-5-phosphoribosyl-1-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi> (PRPP) and glutamine, from PRPP and ammonia, and by an alternative pathway, directly from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52742">ribose-5-phosphate</z:chebi> and ammonia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that extrahepatic tissues may be an important source for the de novo synthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26400">purine ribonucleotide</z:chebi> in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They also indicate that ammonia may play an important role in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The alternative pathway for the synthesis of phosphoribosyl-1-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52742">ribose-5-phosphate</z:chebi> and ammonia was found to be subject to inhibition by the end products of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> synthetic pathway, particularly by adenylic acid and to a lesser degree by guanylic acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The alternative pathway for phosphoribosyl-1-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> synthesis from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52742">ribose-5-phosphate</z:chebi> and ammonia may contribute significantly towards the regulation of the rate of de novo <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> biosynthesis in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> state, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purines</z:chebi> are excessively produced and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
