<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that neutralization of natural killer (NK) cell function with antibodies to either asialo GM1 or NK 1.1 reversed IL-12 inhibition of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in athymic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By immunohistochemistry, those sites where bFGF-induced neovascularization was inhibited by IL-12 displayed accumulation of NK cells and the presence of IP-10-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on expression of the cytolytic mediators perforin and granzyme B, the NK cells were locally activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> treated locally with IL-12 displayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, vascular damage, and NK-cell infiltration surrounding small vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After activation in vitro with IL-12, NK cells from <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice became strongly cytotoxic for primary cultures of syngeneic aortic endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity was neutralized by antibodies to IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results document that NK cells are required mediators of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> inhibition by IL-12, and provide evidence that NK-cell cytotoxicity of endothelial cells is a potential mechanism by which IL-12 can suppress neovascularization </plain></SENT>
