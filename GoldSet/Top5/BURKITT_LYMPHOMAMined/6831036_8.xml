<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal bands were detected in the serum of 12 of 21 patients with extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and 1 of 10 patients with minimal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the bands were identified as IgM of a single light chain class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such bands were not detected in the serum of patients with lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (7) or African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was disappearance of the bands after therapy and reappearance at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings, coupled with previously reported in vitro information, indicate that undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells secrete immunoglobulin of IgM isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, such monoclonal bands may be of potential value as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers </plain></SENT>
