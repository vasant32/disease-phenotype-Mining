<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increase in the labile iron pool (LIP) of iron-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells leads to cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, intracellular free iron catalyzes the formation of highly reactive compounds such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radicals</z:chebi> and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) that damages macromolecular components of cells, eventually resulting in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we have investigated the possible involvement of free radicals in the response of Ramos cells to iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When added to Ramos cells, iron increased the intracellular levels of <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> and NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the addition of free radicals scavengers (TROLOX and Carboxy-PTIO) neutralized the effects of iron on Ramos cells while addition of an NO donor or <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>) to cells generated effects which partially mimicked those induced by iron addition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our results suggest the involvement of free radicals as effectors in the iron specific growth inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells observed in vitro </plain></SENT>
