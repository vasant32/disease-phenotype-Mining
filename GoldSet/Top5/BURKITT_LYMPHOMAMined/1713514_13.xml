<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Six cases of mediastinal large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (MLCL) with <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> were analyzed for the presence and patterns of c-myc and bcl-2 loci rearrangements, and for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA sequences by Southern blot hybridization, c-myc gene alterations were found in three of six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two cases showed the presence of mutations or small rearrangements at the 3' end of the first exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The c-myc gene abnormalities found in these two cases are similar to those observed in the translocation 8;14 of the endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> or in its variants t(2;8) and t(8;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A third case showed a major rearrangement of c-myc gene, with truncation within its first intron, similar to those observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt's and in acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the cases displayed bcl-2 gene rearrangements or contained <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest a possible role for a translocation-mediated c-myc activation in the pathogenesis of MLCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, bcl-2 gene and Epstein-Barr virus do not appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of these peculiar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between c-myc structural modifications and MLCL also seems to be of relevance in light of the peculiar tendency of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> to involve unusual extranodal site (eg, kidney), reminiscent of the spreading attitude of Burkitt's limphomas </plain></SENT>
