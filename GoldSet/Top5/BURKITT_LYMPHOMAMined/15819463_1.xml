<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This work was undertaken to examine the roles of presenting clinical and laboratory features in the survival of a number of Nigerian patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Confirmed cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> diagnosed in the hospital between January 1986 and December 1999 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> was based on fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> cytology of easily accessible mass in a large majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median survival was calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the dead patients using Kaplan-Meier technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SPSS 10 statistical software and EPI 6.04b were used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> statistical calculations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 213 patients were recruited over the 13-year period; with ages ranging from 3-45 years (median = 9) at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The male-female ratio was 1.8:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the time of analysis in December 2001, 166 (77.9%) of patients had defaulted, 44 were known to have died and 3 were still alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 81 (38%) of the patients had adequate chemotherapy (4-6 cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fifty one (23.9%) patients had an initial complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean survival of the 44 patients that died was 10.5 weeks (95% Cl = 3.9-17.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that survival in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was significantly better in patients who had adequate therapy, mean 40.8 +/- 12.2 (SE) weeks compared to those who had less than adequate cycles of chemotherapy, mean 3.7 +/- 1.0 (SE) weeks (p = 0.0000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Inadequate therapy and high default rate were partly responsible for the poor survival results obtained in this study </plain></SENT>
