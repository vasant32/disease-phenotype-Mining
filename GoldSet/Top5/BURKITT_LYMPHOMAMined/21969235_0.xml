<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>Intussusception</z:hpo> is a recognised but unusual presenting feature of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify the clinical features associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> in this setting, and assess the outcome following protocol directed chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective case note review was performed on patients treated for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at our institution between 1976 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> were identified from hospital records and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen of the 210 children seen with a diagnosis of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> during the study period (6.7%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median age was 6.1 years (range 2.5-10.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients presented with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, and two patients with a jaw mass associated with endemic Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients underwent a right hemicolectomy with ileo-colic anastomosis, and five had segmental small-bowel resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients had bone marrow involvement at diagnosis, two of whom died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 6.07 years (range 0.1-28.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should be considered in children presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> above the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> infantile peak age range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presentation is often insidious, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">complete obstruction</z:e> may not be apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, when surgically resected, the majority can achieve a good outcome with additional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
