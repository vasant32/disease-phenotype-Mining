<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CaM kinase-Gr is a multifunctional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase which is enriched in neurons and T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The kinase is absent from primary human B lymphocytes but is expressed in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, suggesting that expression of the kinase can be upregulated by an EBV gene product(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the basis of CaM kinase-Gr expression in EBV-transformed cells and the mechanisms that regulate its activity therein by using an EBV-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, BJAB, and BJAB cells converted to expression of individual EBV proteins by single-gene transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CaM kinase-Gr expression was upregulated in BJAB cells by EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent-infection</z:e> membrane protein 1 (LMP1) but not by LMP2A or by nuclear proteins EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, and EBNA3C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In LMP1-converted BJAB cells, the kinase was functional and was dramatically activated upon cross-linking of surface immunoglobulin M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overlapping cDNA clones that encode human CaM kinase-Gr were sequenced, revealing 81% amino acid identity between the rat and human proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transfection of BJAB cells with an expression construct for the human enzyme resulted in a functional kinase which was shown by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> tagging to localize primarily to cytoplasmic and perinuclear structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Induction of CaM kinase-Gr expression by LMP1 provides the first example of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase upregulated by a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In view of the key role played by LMP1 in B-lymphocyte immortalization by EBV, these findings implicate CaM kinase-Gr as a potential mediator of B-lymphocyte growth transformation </plain></SENT>
