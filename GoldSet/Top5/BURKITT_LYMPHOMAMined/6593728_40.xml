<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The translocated c-myc gene in AW-Ramos, a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line carrying the 8;14 translocation, is expressed at 2- to 5-fold higher levels than c-myc in lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The translocation event has joined c-myc to the IgM switch region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, a recently identified immunoglobulin transcriptional enhancer element is not linked to the translocated c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal recombination occurs approximately equal to 340 nucleotides upstream of the c-myc 5' cap site, leaving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three c-myc exons intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide sequences of the two coding exons in the translocated c-myc gene are identical to those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequence analyses of the first, noncoding c-myc exon and of the region between this exon and the chromosomal recombination point reveal two single-base differences from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that altered expression rather than an altered gene product is responsible for c-myc activation in AW-Ramos cells and that this is a result of either loss of regulatory sequences located greater than 340 nucleotides upstream of c-myc or disruption of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc regulation by one or both base substitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, unidentified enhancer-like sequences in the Ig locus may alter the expression of c-myc </plain></SENT>
