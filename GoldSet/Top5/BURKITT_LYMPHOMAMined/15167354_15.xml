<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MTX may cause neurologic toxicity, but the biochemical effects of MTX on the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) are poorly characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors studied serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from a child during two courses of intraventricular MTX and found a rapid and reproducible <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in CSF of reduced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folates</z:chebi> and S-adenosylmethionine that was accompanied by marked increases in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
