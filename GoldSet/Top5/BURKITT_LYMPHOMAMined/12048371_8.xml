<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the effects on overall survival and for specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-defining illnesses (ADIs), survival among persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> (PWAs) in New York City (NYC) before and after the introduction of combination therapy was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Survival among 79,878 PWAs diagnosed between 1990 and 1998 and reported through March 2001 was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cumulative survival at 24 months among PWAs was estimated by actuarial methods, and Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for covariates was used to estimate the relative hazard (RH) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for specific ADIs over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall cumulative survival at 24 months increased from 43% among PWAs diagnosed during 1990-1995 to 76% for those diagnosed 1996-1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improving survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ADIs was found among PWAs diagnosed after 1995, but changes for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the brain, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334177" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cervical cancer</z:e> were only moderate and were statistically (p &gt;.05) insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334177" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cervical cancer</z:e>, and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the brain had the highest RH of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among PWAs diagnosed after 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Substantial improvements in survival after 1995 were found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PWAs but varied by gender, race, risk, socioeconomic status, and specific ADIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistent with other studies, neoplastic ADIs have shown less improvement than other diseases after 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relatively poor outcome of PWAs with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic diseases</z:e> requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
