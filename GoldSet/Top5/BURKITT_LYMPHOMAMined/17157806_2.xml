<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have examined the activities and levels of the proteasome and TPPII complex in Raji and in Akata cells after induction of EBV lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results show that the chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities of the proteasome were substantially reduced in Raji and Akata cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, TPPII activity was diminished in both cell lines but was recovered in Akata cells at longer time after induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein levels of the alpha/beta subunits of the 20S proteasome and TPPII concentration decreased to different extents after EBV activation, whereas the ubiquitin binding S6' subunit of the 19S regulatory complex increased three to fourfold along with the levels of ubiquitin-conjugates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these observations demonstrate impairment of two major cellular proteolytic systems at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of EBV lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
