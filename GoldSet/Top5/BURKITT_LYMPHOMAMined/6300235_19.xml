<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In confirmation of earlier results, the expression of B2 was found to be restricted to a relatively narrow portion of the B cell maturation pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-B cell-derived lines were uniformly negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hybrids derived from the fusion of highly B2-positive and B2-negative or low B2 expressing lines of B cell origin were B2-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, fusion of B2-positive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines with the primitive human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> line K562 resulted in the complete extinction of B2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings are in line with the expected behavior of a B cell differentiation marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBV conversion of the EBV-negative, B2-negative Ramos <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line by the transforming B95-8 substrain of the virus regularly induced the expression of B2, whereas conversion with the nontransforming P3HR-1 substrain had no such effect, in spite of the continued presence of EBV-DNA and EBNA in both types of EBV-converted sublines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possibility that B2 induction may reflect the action of the transforming gene(s), present in B95-8 but deleted from the P3HR-1 virus, and the implications of this possibility for the functional mapping of the EBV genome are discussed </plain></SENT>
