<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Incidence reports for pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> in Hispanic subpopulations in the United States are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that Florida's Hispanic children would have higher risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> compared with non-Hispanic white children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo>, Hodgkin, non-Hodgkin, and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (SEER International Classification of Diseases for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> codes) in children (&lt; 15 years) in the Florida <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Data System (FCDS) from 1985 to 1997 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were classified as: 1) white, 2) Hispanic, or 3) black, and stratified by age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted rates for the three race-ethnic groups were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rates for Hispanics and blacks were compared with whites as standardized rate ratios (SRR) with 95% confidence intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty-one incident cases of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 1231 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> were identified during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the SRR for Hispanics was 1.32 (95% CI, 1.20-1.44), and for blacks, the SRR was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.63-0.72 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo>, the SRR for Hispanics was 1.29 (95% CI, 1.28-1.30), and for blacks, the SRR was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.54-0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar rates were found for the Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Incidences of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were significantly higher in Florida's Hispanic children, with 30% increased relative risks, compared with whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Black children had significantly decreased incidences and risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Florida's Hispanic children (primarily Cuban and Central American origin) differed from similar reports from Texas and California, where Hispanics are primarily of Mexican origin </plain></SENT>
