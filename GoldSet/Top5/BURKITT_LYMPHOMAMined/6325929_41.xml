<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene product has not been definitively linked to these malignant diseases, although an EBV nuclear antigen(s) (EBNA) seems to be ubiquitous in EBV-infected cells; indeed, the detection of EBNA by immunofluorescence is often taken as an indication of the presence of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As part of a study to investigate which part of the EBV genome is responsible for transformation and whether the same mechanism of cellular transformation is involved in the case of B lymphocytes and epithelial cells, we have tried to establish whether a detectable cellular alteration(s) can be induced in primate epithelial cells by the presence of a specific region of the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here that it can--the result is immortalization of the cells </plain></SENT>
