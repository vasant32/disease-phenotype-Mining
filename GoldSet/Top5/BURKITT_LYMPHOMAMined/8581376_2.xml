<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Single chain bispecific antibodies, in which the genes that encode the VH and VL regions are linked in tandem, may offer some advantages over other methods of bispecific antibody preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To begin to evaluate the potential of this system, a single chain bispecific antibody (scFv2) that binds to the T cell receptor of a cytotoxic T cell clone and to the hapten <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> was constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The individual scFv regions were joined by a 25 amino acid linker, and the scFv2 protein was obtained from insoluble inclusion bodies after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42820">guanidine</z:chebi> solubilization and refolding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">Fluorescein</z:chebi>-purified scFv2 is active at concentrations of approximately 10 nM (approximately 1 microgram/ml) and above in mediating lysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-coupled <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells by the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This system has now been used to evaluate various features of the scFv2 approach: (a) affinities of the scFv2 for the TCR and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>, (b) yields of the scFv2 from several different purification schemes, (c) relationship of antigen density (i.e., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> density on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells) to the ability to redirect lysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell, and (d) relationship of scFv2 affinity for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> antigen to the ability to redirect lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study was performed by using several analogs of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> for which the scFv2 had different affinities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results showed that it should be possible to select antibodies with appropriate affinities such that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells with typical antigen densities of 10(4)-10(5) molecules per cell will be lysed and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells that have lower levels of the antigen will be spared </plain></SENT>
