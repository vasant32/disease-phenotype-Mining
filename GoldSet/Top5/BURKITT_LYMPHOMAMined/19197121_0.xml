<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EBV DNA was detected by Southern hybridization, and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> chromosomal integration sites were identified using G banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BamHI-digested genomic DNA from Raji cells was hybridized with (32)P-labeled probe-1 (EBV genome 13,232 approximately 16,189) and Probe-2 (EBV genome 5 approximately 3,271), which generated 4 and 10, 23 kb positive bands respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> integration sites included 1p, 1q, 2q, 3p, 3q, 4 q, 5q, 6q, 7p, 7q, 9q,11p, 14 q, and 15q,and chromosomal bands 4 q, 2q, 1q and 7q were <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> integration sites with high frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 33 signals counted, 7, 4, 4,and 4 signals were at the site 4 q, 2q, 1q, and 7q respectively, and 64% of the total signals were found in these 4 chromosomal bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> integration occurred in chromosomes 16 approximately 22 or the sex chromosomes (X, Y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study firstly identifies the EBV integration sites in Raji cells using G banding and FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There are some <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> integration sites with high frequencies in Raji cells, and EBV integrates into Raji cell genomes non-randomly </plain></SENT>
