<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although NFAT has been recently shown to be inducible in several non-T immune cells, the NFAT gene family members characterized to date have been isolated only from T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further characterize NFAT function in human B cells and to demonstrate cytokine gene specificity of NFAT proteins, we report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone from the Raji B cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cDNA clone encodes a new isoform, NFATc.beta, of the NFAT gene family member NFATc (designated here NFATc.alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amino acid sequence of NFATc.beta differs from that of NFATc. alpha in the first <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal 29 residues and contains an additional region of 142 residues at the COOH terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Northern analysis using a probe encompassing a common region of both isoforms showed two <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species of 2.7 and 4.5 kilobase pairs, while an NFATc.beta-specific probe detected only the 4.5-kilobase pair <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> which was preferentially expressed in the spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transient expression of NFATc.beta was capable of activating an interleukin-2 NFAT-driven reporter gene in stimulated Jurkat cells in a CsA-sensitive manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, NFATc.beta neither bound to the kappa3 element (an NFAT-binding site) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha promoter nor activated the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha promoter in cotransfection assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that different members or isoforms of NFAT gene family may regulate inducible expression of different cytokine genes </plain></SENT>
