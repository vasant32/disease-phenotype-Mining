<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unprecedented gains have been made in the cure rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> during the past two decades and these reflect steady improvements in treatment protocols and a multidisciplinary approach to patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the life-threatening side effects associated with conventional treatment urge us to explore new strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">Arsenic trioxide</z:chebi> (ATO), a natural product that has improved the prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (APL) from highly fatal to highly curable, has also been proven to be effective in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines through multiple pathways in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data indicates that ATO can inhibit the proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines through 1) arresting the cell cycle; 2) decreasing the respiratory function and transmembrane potential of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo>; and 3) downregulating the expressions of Survivin, Bcl-2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>-1, and VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We therefore suggest that dissecting the pharmaceutical mechanism of ATO at the molecular and cellular levels may be a good strategy to explore the value of traditional <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33243">natural products</z:chebi> in treating high malignant Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
