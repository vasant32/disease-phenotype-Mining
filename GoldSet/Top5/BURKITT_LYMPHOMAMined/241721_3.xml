<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Purification conditions were limited by the instability of both antigen and antibody activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibody was inactivated under <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the conditions commonly used to dissociate antigen--antibody complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antigen was inactivated at pH 2-3, and was irreversibly bound to Sephadex G-200 conjugates which had not been exposed to large excesses of serum </plain></SENT>
