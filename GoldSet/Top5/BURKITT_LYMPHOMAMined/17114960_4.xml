<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the translocation is seen in only 3% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALL</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 translocation occurs in utero in 1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> newborn children at cell levels of 10 to 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we explore the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1-positive cells in 2 cohorts of healthy blood donors by real-time and nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1-positive cells were demonstrated in 10 of 2005 healthy donors, that is, a prevalence of 0.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1-positive cells was estimated to 10 to 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed prevalence of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1-positive cells in healthy adults is of the same order of magnitude as the prevalence reported in healthy newborns, but the observed cell level of 10 to 10 is much lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicates that prenatal <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 subclones does not persist throughout adult life at cell levels of 10 to 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings are compatible with the risk of t(12;21)(p13;q22) ALL correlating with the total number of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1-positive cells in peripheral blood in both childhood and adulthood </plain></SENT>
