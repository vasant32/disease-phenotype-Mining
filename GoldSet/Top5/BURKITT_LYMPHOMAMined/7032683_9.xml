<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A group of 227 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> included seven favorable and four unfavorable histologic classes with collective median survival times of 83 and 16 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The favorable group included three follicular subgroups (cleaved, mixed, and large noncleaved) and four diffuse classes (small lymphocytic, cleaved, Burkitt's noncleaved, and convoluted lymphocytic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The unfavorable group consisted of four diffuse subgroups (plasmacytoid lymphocytic, mixed, and small and large noncleaved) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in collective median survivals between patients in Stage I--II and those in Stage III--IV in both the favorable group (not reached, NR versus 62 months, P less than 0.001) and the unfavorable group (57 months versus 12 months, P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of complete response to primary treatment was higher in the favorable than in the unfavorable group (75% versus 56%, P = 0.002) and in those with limited as compared with advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete responders in both prognostic groups had longer survival times than did partial or minimal responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant difference in median complete remission duration was found between responders in Stage I--II versus Stages III-IV in the favorable group (not reached versus 40 months, P = 0.001) but not in the unfavorable one (56 months versus 22 months, P greater than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The absence of relapses after 41 months among complete responders in the favorable but not in the unfavorable group suggests a potential for cure in a proportion of cases from the former group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of complete response was lower and median remission duration was shorter after secondary as compared with primary treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of this study confirm the prognostic value of the Lukes and Collins classification system and the importance of initial staging and of achieving a complete response to primary treatment in both the favorable and unfavorable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
