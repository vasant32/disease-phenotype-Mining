<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The levels and kinetics of specific cellular transcripts, such as Stat3, Frmd6, Mad1, Sepp1, c-fos, c-jun, and egr1, which were activated by NaB and TSA, were similar in HH514-16 cells treated with VPA </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Changes in cellular gene expression in response to VPA, NaB, or TSA were globally similar as assessed by human genome arrays; however, VPA selectively stimulated the expression of some cellular genes, such as MEF2D, YY1, and ZEB1, that could repress the EBV lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
