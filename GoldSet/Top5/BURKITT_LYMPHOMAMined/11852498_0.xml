<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From a total of 210 case histories of patients with NHL, 188 presenting a complete pathology report were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter was either based on the REAL classification or was converted to it by an expert </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of the patients at the time of diagnosis were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in the distribution by sex among mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, with a predominance among males (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The youngest patients were diagnosed of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and B lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient status improved significantly (p = 0.0001), with a predominance of ECOG 0, and the stage of the patients studied was 74.1% (stage III/IV) versus 25.9% (stage I/II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The different characteristics of patients with NHL suggest the need for a single classification with diagnosis by histological subtype </plain></SENT>
