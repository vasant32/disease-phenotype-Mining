<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes the functional consequences induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-derived c-myc mutations located in c-myc box II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two mutated alleles were studied, focusing on the P138C mutation, and compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The c-Myc transformation, transactivation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> activities were explored based on cells over-expressing c-Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the transcriptional activation activity was not affected, our experiments exploring the anchorage-independent growth capacity of c-Myc-transfected Rat1a cells showed that c-Myc box II mutants were less potent than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> c-Myc in promoting cell transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considering the possibility that these mutations could be interfering with the ability of c-Myc to promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we tested c-Myc-transfected Rat1a fibroblasts under several conditions: serum deprivation-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi>- and TNFalpha-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the mutated alleles were characterized by an overall decrease in ability to mediate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates that point mutations located in c-Myc box II can decrease the ability of the protein to promote both transformation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> without modifying its transactivating activity </plain></SENT>
