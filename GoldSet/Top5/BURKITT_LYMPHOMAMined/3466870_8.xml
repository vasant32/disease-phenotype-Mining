<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cell lines established from T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> have recently been reported to exhibit a chromosome translocation t(8;14) involving proto-oncogene c-myc and the gene of the T-cell receptor alpha-chain(TcR-alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this work, we have studied a case of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> presenting a t(8;14)(q24;q11) translocation that was found in fresh leukemic cells taken during relapse, but was absent in cells collected at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hybridization analysis showed that the breakpoint on chromosome 8 was located 3' to the c-myc exon 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A TcR-alpha-specific original probe (D14S7, Mathieu-Mahul et al., 1985) revealed two differently rearranged patterns in DNA from leukemic cells obtained at diagnosis and during relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the rearranged TcR-beta-gene DNA pattern did not change during the course of the disease, indicating that leukemic cells were clonally related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the chromosome breakpoint in 14q11 is situated in the TcR-alpha locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that translocations t(8;14) involving TcR-alpha and c-myc genes in T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> are analogous to variant t(2;8) and t(8;22) translocations observed in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They also establish that the same types of molecular rearrangements due to a t(8;14)(q24;q11) translocation, at first described in T-cell lines established in culture, also exist in vivo and may play a role in the evolution of the leukemic process </plain></SENT>
