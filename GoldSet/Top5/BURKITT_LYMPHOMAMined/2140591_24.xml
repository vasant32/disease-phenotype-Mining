<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The nuclear protein p53 has been reported to be associated with cell transformation and/or proliferation so that the study of p53 expression in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> has potentially important clinical implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the p53 expression in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-stimulated and nonstimulated human lymphocytes, in several human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines (Molt-4, Raji, Daudi, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60, KG-1, K562 and U937) and in fresh bone marrow (BM) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous differential staining of p53 (identified by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-labeled monoclonal antibody) versus DNA (stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi>, PI), followed by bivariate analysis with flow cytometry (FCM) made it possible to evaluate p53 expression with respect to cell position during the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data show that in stimulated lymphocytes p53 is progressively accumulated during the G1, S and G2-phases, while in non-stimulated conditions most cells are remaining in G0/G1 and express p53 to a lesser degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that expression of p53 is more correlated with cell growth than with entrance into (or progression through particular phases of) the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines express elevated levels of p53, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined human <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines synthesize negligible p53 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Understanding the variations in p53 expression in different types of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> may provide some insight into the biologic roles of p53 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant cells </plain></SENT>
