<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin receptor number was increased without a change in receptor affinity, in association with an increase in the receptor alpha and beta subunits detected after cell-surface labelling and immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">Butyrate</z:chebi> effects were not unspecific, as the binding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor and growth hormone and the expression of the B cell markers CD20, B5 and CD21 was not increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The low expression of insulin receptors on Raji cells is therefore a reflection of the less differentiated state of these cells compared to lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
