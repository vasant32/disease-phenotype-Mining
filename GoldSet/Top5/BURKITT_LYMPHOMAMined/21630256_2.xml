<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and antibodies reactive to SE36 antigen, a recombinant protein based on P. falciparum serine repeat antigen 5 gene, targeted by protective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases were children (0-14 years) enrolled at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana, during 1965-1994 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> confirmed by histology or cytology (92% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls were apparently healthy children enrolled contemporaneous to the cases from the nearest neighbor house to the case house and were age,- sex-frequency-matched to the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-SE36 IgG antibodies were measured using enzyme-linked absorbent immunoassays (ELISAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SE36 titers were estimated by extrapolating ELISA optical density readings to a standard fitting curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-SE36 titers were log-transformed for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean log endpoint dilution titers were 0.63 logs lower in cases than in controls (8.26 [SD 1.68] vs. 8.89 [SD 1.75], Student's t-test, p = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lower titers were observed in cases than controls aged 0-4 years (p = 0.05) and in those aged 5-14 years (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Low and medium tertiles of anti-SE36 IgG antibodies were associated with increased OR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> ([OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.21-2.31] and [OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.96-1.86], respectively, p(trend) = 0.002) in analyses adjusting for age, sex, calendar period and test plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that compared to similarly aged children enrolled from the same community, children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in Ghana have lower antibodies to SE36 antigen </plain></SENT>
