<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess clinicopathological characteristics and outcome in a series of primary ocular adnexal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (POALs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with localised (stage IE) POAL were followed for a median of 96 months (24-156) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was based on surgical biopsies followed by immunohistochemistry in 16 cases or fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> followed by immunocytophenotypic analysis in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were treated with local radiotherapy (RT), five with chemotherapy (CT), and two refused further therapy after apparently radical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> removal achieved by the diagnostic excisional biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The histological and immunological pattern was consistent with a diagnosis of MALT-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (11 cases), follicular center non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (three cases). a large-cell variant of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (one case), and large-cell transformed MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed in the three cases which underwent fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients achieved and maintained complete remission except for those treated with surgical excision alone (two MALT conjunctival <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases): one of these relapsed locally, the other experienced the systemic spread of a transformed diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and died 72 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The side effects consisted of two cases of RT-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> after 52 and 72 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of histology, prognosis was excellent when surgery plus RT was adopted, and CT seems to be a valid alternative to RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgery alone may be sub-optimal </plain></SENT>
