<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess Ki 67 proliferative index (PI) in tissue sections, with relation to grade and clinical parameters associated with non Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Pakistani population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of non Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diagnosed at histopathology section of Dow Diagnostic research and reference laboratory from October 2008 to June 2010, were included for this cross sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study using monoclonal antibody MIB 1, Dako, Denmark against Ki 67 antigen was carried out on paraffin embedded tissue blocks of 62 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ki 67 PI, with cutoff 45% was assessed in relation to specific phenotype, age, gender, site of origin and B symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean Ki 67 PI was also calculated considering specific phenotype according to WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 62 patients, Ki 67 PI &gt; 45% was noted in 39 (62.9%) cases, whereas, in 23 (37%) cases the PI was &lt; 45% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean Ki 67 PI was highest in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore Ki 67 PI &gt; 45% was seen in 21/25 (84%) cases with extra nodal involvement and 24/29 (82.7%) cases with B symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mean Ki 67 PI can discriminate the indolent versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behaviour</z:hpo> of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the study population significant association of high Ki 67 PI &gt; 45% was found in relation to B symptoms and site of involvement, in terms of extra nodal origin, for non Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These correlations demonstrate the significant role of high Ki 67 PI, to establish the proliferative activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> as prognostic index marker along with clinical parameters at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
