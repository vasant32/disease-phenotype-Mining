<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper presents data on the effects of interferon treatment on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gene expression in latently infected Daudi Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, and reviews the possible role of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene products in the regulation of translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Daudi cells the main virally coded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> are the small untranslated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> EBER-1 and EBER-2, two <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for the DNA binding protein EBNA-1, and a number of small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> containing sequences from the BamHI W repeat region of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interferon treatment does not change the qualitative pattern of EBV gene expression but decreases the levels of the EBNA-1 mRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chromatographic behaviour of EBV-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> on CF11-cellulose indicates that many contain double-stranded regions; these <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> co-purify with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> that activates the interferon-induced, dsRNA-sensitive protein kinase DAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computer analysis indicates that the exons transcribed from the BamHI W repeats have the potential for formation of very stable secondary structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many viruses can counteract the inhibition of protein synthesis mediated by the DAI-catalysed phosphorylation of initiation factor eIF-2 and our data suggest that the small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> EBER-1 may fulfil this function in the EBV system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and immortalization of B lymphocytes by EBV the synthesis of large amounts of EBER-1 RNA might thus allow the virus to circumvent one of the interferon-mediated mechanisms of host cell defence </plain></SENT>
