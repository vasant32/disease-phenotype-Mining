<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The six latent-cycle nuclear antigens (EBNAs) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), whose genes share 5' leader exons and two promoters (Cp and Wp), are differentially expressed by cells of the B lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the possibility that EBNA gene expression is regulated through selective use of Cp and Wp, we monitored the activity of promoter-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (CAT) gene constructs transfected into EBV-positive and EBV-negative B lymphocytes and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Wp was a much stronger promoter than Cp in EBV genome-negative B-cell lines and was used exclusively in primary B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When B cells were infected with transforming EBV, Cp became the stronger promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This switch was not observed when B cells were infected with an immortalization-deficient virus, P3HR-1, which lacks the EBNA-2 open reading frame and expresses a mutant leader protein (EBNA-LP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cp function was transactivated when EBV-negative or P3HR-1-infected B cells were cotransfected with Cp and a 12-kb fragment of DNA (BamHI-WWYH) that spanned the P3HR-1 deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This activity was mapped to the EBNA-2 gene within WWYH; constructs expressing EBNA-LP did not induce Cp function, and the deletion of 405 bp from the EBNA-2 open reading frame abolished transactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This research demonstrates host cell and EBNA-2 regulation of latent-cycle promoter activity in B lymphocytes, a mechanism with implications for persistence of EBV-infected lymphoid cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
