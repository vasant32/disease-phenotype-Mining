<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A radioimmunoassay (RIA) was developed and used to determine the level of fragment E [a fibrinogen/fibrin degradation product (FDP)] and of fragment-E-containing substances (FES) in sera and effusion fluids of patients with malignant diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sera of patients with other diseases and sera of healthy individuals served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were expressed as units/ml (U/ml), one unit being equivalent to 40 ng pure fragment E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effusion fluids of both malignant and nonmalignant origin contained relatively high levels of fragment-E-containing substances, up to 7,500 U/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> sera had less than 30 U/ml, while sera of patients with a variety of neoplastic or nonneoplastic conditions contained larger amounts, reaching to hundreds and, in rare cases (some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>), even thousands of U/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some of the highest levels in the malignant sera were found in samples from patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>stomach cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>About 10%-20% of the reactive material in effusions and 20%-40% in the sera consisted of fragment E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results confirm earlier findings of high FDP levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given the higher accuracy of the radioimmunoassay and its suitability for large scale testing, it would appear worthwhile to continue such studies to explore the clinical usefulness of the RIA for fragment E </plain></SENT>
