<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To identify surface Ag uniquely expressed on human germinal center B cells, we produced a mouse mAb, HJ6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When tonsillar lymphocytes were examined, HJ6 did not label T cells and labeled only about half of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>+ B cells that were HK23- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HJ6 did not label mononuclear cells from peripheral blood, splenocytes, and any of 29 cell lines including 23 B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This binding pattern of HJ6 was very similar to that of a mAb named 5B5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was shown previously that 5B5 bound a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> named CTH (CD77) and its Ag was expressed on HK23- <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>+ tonsillar lymphocytes and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite the similarity, HJ6 differed from 5B5: HJ6 did not stain Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and stained <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>+ tonsillar lymphocytes in the presence of a large concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When its binding to isolated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> was studied, HJ6 was found to bind globoside and Forssman Ag and not to other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> including CTH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When its binding to neutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> extracted from tonsillar lymphocytes was studied, HJ6 bound only globoside; Forssman Ag was not detected in tonsillar lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we conclude that globoside is a B cell Ag expressed on a subpopulation of germinal center B cells </plain></SENT>
