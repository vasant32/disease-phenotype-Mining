<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the possibility that EBV-immortalized B cells might produce interleukin-6 (IL-6) proteins in an autocrine manner was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that culture supernatants from EBV-transformed B cells, but not from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, augmented the proliferation of an IL-6-dependent murine hybridoma clone, MH60.BSF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This growth-promoting activity for hybridoma cells found in culture supernatants of EBV-transformed B cells was specifically neutralized by rabbit anti-recombinant (r) IL-6 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IL-6 activity in culture supernatants of EBV-transformed B cells, though much less than that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS)-stimulated monocytes, was increased by the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot experiments using rabbit anti-rIL-6 antiserum demonstrated that supernatants from cultured EBV-transformed B cells contained the distinct forms of IL-6, with a peak of 23,000 MW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When examined by in situ hybridization analysis, it was found that IL-6 mRNA were expressed on EBV-transformed B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was noted that a fraction, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, of these cells expressed IL-6 mRNA strongly, implying their cell cycle-dependent expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, it was shown that rIL-6 promoted the growth of EBV-transformed B cells at low cell densities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that IL-6 serves as an autocrine growth factor in EBV-transformed B cells </plain></SENT>
