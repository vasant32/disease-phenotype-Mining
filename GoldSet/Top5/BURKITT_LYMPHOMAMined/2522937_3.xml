<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In CD3- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> derived from immature T cells, V gamma genes more proximal to J gamma were frequently rearranged; V gamma 8, V gamma 9, V gamma 10, and V gamma 11 were used in 19 of 24 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CD3+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> derived from a more mature stage of T cell ontogeny, showed a high frequency of rearrangements involving V gamma genes distal to J gamma; V gamma 2, V gamma 3, V gamma 4, and V gamma 5 were used in 17 of 25 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In B-precursor ALL, no notable bias of V gamma gene usage was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This probably reflects the possibility that TCR genes may not rearrange according to a T cell hierarchy when under control of a B cell gene program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, deletions of those V gamma genes located 3' to rearranged V gamma genes were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This supports the theory that loop deletion is a major mechanism for TCR-gamma gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
