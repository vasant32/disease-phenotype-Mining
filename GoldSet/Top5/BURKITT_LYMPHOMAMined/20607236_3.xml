<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The microenvironment produced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> is inhibitory to the immune system, inducing dendritic cell (DC) alterations, but there is a paucity of information regarding haematological malignances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate DC differentiation under the influence of leukemic cell products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monocytes from healthy volunteers were cultured in the presence of IL-4 and GM-CSF for the generation of immature DCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Supernatants from leukemic cultures were added to monocyte cultures during differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lineages used were K562, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60, a promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and DAUDI, originated from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was observed that the expression of CD14 remained high and the CD1a was low in the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> supernatants, while non-malignant supernatants did not affect these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production by monocytes during differentiation was increased by the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> supernatants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The modifications on CD14 and CD1a expressions could be mimicked by the addition of exogenous IL-1beta and partially inhibited by the neutralization of IL-1beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that soluble products from leukemic cells interfere with DC differentiation and, in the present work, this effect could be mediated by monocyte-derived IL-1beta in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> supernatants </plain></SENT>
