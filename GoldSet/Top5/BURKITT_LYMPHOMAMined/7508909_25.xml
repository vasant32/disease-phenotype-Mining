<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The vav proto-oncogene product (p95vav) is specifically expressed in cells of the hematopoietic system, contains one Src homology 2 and two Src homology 3 domains, and is a substrate for receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting experiments using an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody showed that interferon alpha (IFN alpha) induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of p95vav after binding to its cell surface receptor in the U-266 human <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IFN alpha-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p95vav was time- and dose-dependent, confirming the specificity of the process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IFN alpha-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p95vav was also observed in other hematopoietic cell lines of B-cell origin (Daudi), T-cell origin (MOLT-4), and promyelocytic origin (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation experiments performed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>-labeled U-266 cells and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26051">phosphoaminoacid</z:chebi> analysis of the bands corresponding to p95vav showed that p95vav is phosphorylated on serine residues prior to IFN alpha stimulation of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After IFN alpha stimulation significant amounts of phosphorylation of p95vav on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32789">tyrosine residues</z:chebi> were detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tyrosine phosphorylation of p95vav in U-266 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells was also induced by two other Type I IFNs, IFN beta and IFN omega </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether these data suggest that the vav proto-oncogene product is a substrate for a Type I IFN-regulated tyrosine kinase(s) and may be involved in the signal transduction pathway of Type I IFNs in hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
