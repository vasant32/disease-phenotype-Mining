<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using a subtractive cDNA approach, we have identified a number of genes expressed in murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo>, but not B or pre-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of these genes, 289A, expresses a 1.8-kb microsomally localized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> that encodes a 314-amino-acid protein containing a signal sequence and a hydrophobic transmembrane domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequence comparison suggests that the predicted protein is the murine homologue of a human cell surface pan-epithelial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> known variously as EGP, GA733-2, KSA, and KS1/4, recognized by mAb HEA125, GA733, KS1/4, CO17-1A, M74, and 323/A3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 289A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is highly expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> murine tissues containing epithelial cells, and at a low level in plasma cells induced by LPS stimulation of spleen B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is expressed in 15 of 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo>, but at a much lower level, if at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, in pre-B or B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In human B cell lines, 289A detects a 1.5-kb <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line 8226, but not in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent FACS analysis of human cell lines with the mAb GA733 and KS1/4 demonstrated concordant expression of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that 289A is the murine homologue of EGP, GA733-2, KSA, and KS1/4 Ag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although its expression was previously thought to be restricted to epithelial cells, it is also expressed in plasma cells and is a B lymphocyte differentiation Ag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of the multiplicity of names, we propose calling the human gene hEGP314, and the murine gene mEGP314 </plain></SENT>
