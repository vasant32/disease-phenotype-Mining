<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The PCR suppression effect is mediated by long inverted terminal repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of the restriction enzyme digestion and the adapter ligation are crucial in the success of the SSH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We modified the original SSH protocol in order to improve the efficiency of the subtraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A magnetic bead based separation step has been included after the ligation step, to purify the successfully ligated fraction of the tester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBV(NEO) infected Akata(-) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line was compared with the EBV(-) Akata(-) cell line to isolate differentially expressed genes with the improved SSH protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some 44 cDNA clones that showed the greatest differences in expression have been sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of them, 20 showed more than 3-fold difference in expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 20 genes were EBV genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To quantitate the expression levels, high density nylon cDNA array hybridization was optimized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis of the data revealed that the spotting of the arrayer is exceptionally reproducible, which makes the comparison of the hybridization of parallel filters possible </plain></SENT>
