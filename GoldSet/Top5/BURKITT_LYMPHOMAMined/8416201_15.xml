<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) induces unlimited growth of B lymphocytes in vitro, a phenomenon known as immortalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The elucidation of the mechanisms by which EBV de-regulates B-cell proliferation in vitro will permit an understanding of how the virus contributes in vivo to the genesis of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and of lymphoproliferations in immunosuppressed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At present, no single EBV immortalizing gene has been identified, and the hypothesis has been made that many <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes cooperate in establishing an autocrine loop of secretion leading to immortalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Constitutive expression of B-cell surface molecules such as CD21 and CD23, specifically implicated in the control of B-cell proliferation, is indeed induced at the surface of immortalized B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) has been shown to be in part responsible for CD21 and CD23 up-regulation, and EBNA2 is suspected to be a transactivator of cellular genes, although this point remains to be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The role of EBNA2 gene, independently of other <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes, has been investigated by transfection into B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, but conflicting results have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To further investigate its role in the regulation of CD21 and CD23 molecules, we have compared the effects of EBNA2 expression in 2 sets of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines infected with P3HR1 EBV strain, and/or transfected with EBNA2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We report here that: (i) EBNA2 expression is not a sufficient condition to induce CD21 and CD23 upregulation, EBNA2's effects are highly dependent on the cellular context, and moreover can be modified by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with P3HR1 virus; (ii) EBNA2 induces activation of CD23 expression in a very particular way, namely, an increased quantity of CD23 steady-state <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> coding for the form A of the protein, which is not detectable at the cell surface but directly secreted </plain></SENT>
