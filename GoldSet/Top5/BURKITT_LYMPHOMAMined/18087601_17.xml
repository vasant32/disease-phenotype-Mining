<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The national registry-based case-control study ESCALE (Etude sur les <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> de l'enfant) was carried out in France over the period 2003-2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Population controls were frequency matched with the cases on age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maternal household use of pesticides during pregnancy and paternal use during pregnancy or childhood were reported by the mothers in a structured telephone questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="57" ids="24852">Insecticides</z:chebi> (used at home, on pets, or for garden crops), <z:chebi fb="95" ids="24527">herbicides</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="36" ids="24127">fungicides</z:chebi> were distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We estimated odds ratios (ORs) using unconditional regression models closely adjusting for age, sex, degree of urbanization, and type of housing (flat or house) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included a total of 764 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL), 130 of Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>), 166 of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), and 1,681 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="56" ids="24852">Insecticide</z:chebi> use during pregnancy was significantly associated with childhood AL [OR = 2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7-2.5], both lymphoblastic and myeloblastic, NHL (OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.6), mainly for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.5), and mixed-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> (OR = 4.1; 95% CI, 1.4-11.8), but not nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> (OR = 1.1; 95% CI, 0.6-1.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Paternal household use of pesticides was also related to AL (OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8) and NHL (OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.6); but for AL the relationships did not remain after adjustment for maternal <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> use during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study findings strengthen the hypothesis that domestic use of pesticides may play a role in the etiology of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The consistency of the findings with those of previous studies on AL raises the question of the advisability of preventing <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> use by pregnant women </plain></SENT>
