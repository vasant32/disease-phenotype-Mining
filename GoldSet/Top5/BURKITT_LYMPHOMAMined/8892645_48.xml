<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ISG15, a 15-kDa protein of unique primary amino acid sequence, functions intracellularly as a ubiquitin homologue and a cytokine that induces production of IFN-gamma and augments NK/lymphokine-activated killer cell proliferation and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ISG15 is secreted from monocytes and lymphocytes, and in this study we have characterized in vitro and in vivo production of ISG15 in response to IFN-alphabeta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low levels of ISG15 were present constitutively in PBMCs; dose-dependent ISG15 synthesis was observed in response to IFN-alpha or IFN-beta, but not IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High m.w. conjugates, present in PBMC extracts constitutively, were enhanced after IFN-alpha or IFN-beta treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated that IFN-beta-induced ISG15 was released from primary cultures of peripheral blood CD3+ (including both CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ISG15 was released from viable cell lines of monocyte, T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte, and epithelial origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since ISG15 was secreted in response to IFN treatment in vitro, its levels in the serum of healthy human volunteers treated with IFN-beta(ser) were quantitated by asymmetric sandwich ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both single and multiple doses of IFN-beta(ser) increased serum ISG15 levels significantly (p &lt; 0.01) over baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A maximum 7.3-fold enhancement of serum ISG15 was obtained after multiple injections of 8 million units of IFN-beta(ser) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant change was observed at 24 and 48 h of multiple 0.02-million-unit injections, yielding 1.2- and 1.7-fold increases over basal levels, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that ISG15 is a novel member of the cytokine cascade that is synthesized and released in response to IFN-beta both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
