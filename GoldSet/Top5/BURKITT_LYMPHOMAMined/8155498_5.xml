<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte subsets were analyzed from mononuclear cell fractions by flow cytometry and use of monoclonal antibodies CD3, CD20, CD4, CD8, CD4/Leu-8, and CD4/CD45RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood total leukocyte, neutrophil, and B-cell counts recovered early, although defective B-cell function was seen in several patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T-cell counts and thus total lymphocyte counts required a longer time to normalize even though inducer T-cell subsets (CD4+CD45RA+ and CD4+Leu-8-) were present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or high amounts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD8+ T cells recovered earlier than CD4+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lymphocyte, B-cell and T-cell counts of most patients normalized during the first 12 months after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recovery of total lymphocyte and T-cell counts was slow in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> or Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and rapid in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>nephroblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiotherapy seemed to prolong the recovery of study parameters, particularly T-cell recovery </plain></SENT>
