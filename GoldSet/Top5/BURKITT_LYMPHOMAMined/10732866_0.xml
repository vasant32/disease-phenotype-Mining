<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>p53 is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene encoding a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays an important role in the control of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have tried to establish the value of the p53 protein expression in peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) cells of patients with some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A recently developed fixation/permeabilization method was modified for flow cytometric assessment of p53 protein expression using two anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p53 quantitation expressed as molecules of equivalent soluble <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51217">fluorochrome</z:chebi> per cell (MESF) providing valuable data contributing to a more precise definition of leukemic cells, was also applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings showed higher percentage of p53 expression in cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients at the time of diagnosis opposite to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data, in association with immunophenotype of cells, accompanied diagnosis of relapse or definition of remission after allogeneic BM transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed also elevated levels of p53 protein at initial diagnosis of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to our results quantitation of p53 protein allows better characterization of selected population of BM cells and should be used for the monitoring of blast persistence during and after therapy and might also be one of the methods to indicate early relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Percentage of p53 protein positivity varied in our group of B-CLL patients tested in connection with progression of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We documented also one case of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with high percentage of p53 positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Measurement of p53 protein expression by flow cytometry may be of clinical importance by indicating levels of positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest, that p53 alteration is frequently involved at initial diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, in some T-cell disorders and on the contrary more frequently during early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> relapse, in advanced stages of B-CLL and in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>p53 protein quantitation is of value to ascertain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and provides additional parameter suitable for the evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> and for the monitoring of therapy </plain></SENT>
