<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the clinical and genetic features of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with or without leukemic presentation, we have conducted clinical, cytogenetic, and genetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 40 Japanese patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> examined by cytogenetic and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis or Southern blot analysis using MYC probes, 35 patients had t(8;14) translocations, and 5 had t(8;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Breakpoints were located far upstream of MYC in 4 (12%) of 33 tumors with t(8;14), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epstein-Barr virus infection</z:e> was found in 3 (8%) of 40 tumors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings are similar to those reported for non-Japanese patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> form of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and genetic characteristic were compared for 30 patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 10 presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall survival was shorter in aggressively treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients than in aggressively treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients (P = .003); however, the incidence rates of TP53 mutation, p16INK4a deletion, and p15INK4b deletion that were found in 6 (15%) of 40,3 (9%) of 35, and 2 (6%) of 35 tumors, respectively, were similar between the 2 subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the present study has shown the different prognoses for the 2 subtypes of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but has failed to clarify the genetic backgrounds that may explain the different outcomes </plain></SENT>
