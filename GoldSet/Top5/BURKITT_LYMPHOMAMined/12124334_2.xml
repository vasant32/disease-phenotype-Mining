<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that hypoestoxide (HE), a natural <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23849">diterpenoid</z:chebi> [a bicyclo (9, 3, 1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28897">pentadecane</z:chebi>], is a potent <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we demonstrate that HE also inhibits the growth of a variety of human and murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines in vitro at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 10 microM and was inactive as a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagen</z:chebi> in the Ames test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HE exhibited highly potent (0.3-10 mg/kg dose ranges) activities against B16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> growth in C57BL/6 mice and P388D1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in C57BL/6 x <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2 F(1) mice, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At a low maximal effective dose of 5 mg/kg, HE induced significant in vivo antitumor activities that were better than or comparable with most of the standard chemotherapeutic antiangiogenic agents tested: <z:chebi fb="11" ids="16962">cortisone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, Adriamycin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the agents, except <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, had much higher maximal effective doses than HE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HE arrested the growth of human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> CA46 cells and HeLa (cervical epitheloid <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) cells in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle, which was caused by interference, either direct or indirect, with actin assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the cell cycle arrest occurred at cytokinesis, as demonstrated by an increase in the number of <z:mp ids='MP_0003708'>binucleate</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, HE inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor-induced cell proliferation in vitro, with an IC(50) of 28.6 microM, and it significantly inhibited basic fibroblast growth factor-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> on the chick chorioallantoic membrane, with an IC50 of 10 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HE inhibited endothelial cell migration on vitronectin, collagen, and fibronectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Besides its activity as a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi>, HE also has promise for the chemotherapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
