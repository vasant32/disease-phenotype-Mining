<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that translocations of V(H) genes from chromosome 14 to chromosome 8 and of the c-myc oncogene from chromosome 8 to chromosome 14 occur in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with the t(8;14) chromosome translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An association of the c-myc gene with the C(mu) immunoglobulin gene has been observed in some but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> studied previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have investigated the organization of the human heavy chain locus and of the c-myc gene in the P3HR-1 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Becuase mouse/P3HR-1 somatic cell hybrids that retain only the 14q+ chromosome and no other human chromosome contain the human C(mu) and C(gamma) genes but not V(H) genes, we have concluded that the breakpoint on chromosome 14 in P3HR-1 cells is distal to C(mu) and between C(mu) and V(H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the breakpoint of human chromosome 14 differs in different Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found that the human c-myc oncogene translocated to chromosome 14 in the P3HR-1 cell line is not recombined with the C(mu) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint on human chromosome 8 may therefore also differ in different Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, because we have observed DNA rearrangement of the c-myc gene with the C(mu) gene in only some of the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines studied elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, high levels of transcripts of the c-myc oncogene were observed in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with translocated c-myc oncogenes both rearranged and unrearranged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the translocation of a c-myc oncogene to the heavy chain locus on human chromosome 14 is apparently sufficient for its transcriptional activation and may be an essential step in the pathway leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
