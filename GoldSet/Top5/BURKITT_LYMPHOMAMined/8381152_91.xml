<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that several human B cell lines were able to constitutively secrete human (h)IL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas none of the pre-B nor the plasmocytic cell lines tested produced hIL-10, 25 of the 36 tested mature B cell lines (lymphoblastoid and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines) secreted hIL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 24 of these 25 hIL-10-producing B cell lines contained the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome, suggesting a relationship between hIL-10 production by human B cell lines and EBV expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, whereas polyclonal activation via triggering of surface immunoglobulins or CD40 antigen induced highly purified <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B lymphocytes to produce only low (0.3-0.4 ng/ml) but significant amounts of hIL-10, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> induced them to secrete high amounts of hIL-10 (4-9 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, addition of exogenous hIL-10, simultaneously to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, potentiated cell proliferation, whereas a blocking anti-IL-10 antiserum inhibited it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, hIL-10 produced by infected human B lymphocytes appears to be involved in the mechanisms of EBV-induced B cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
