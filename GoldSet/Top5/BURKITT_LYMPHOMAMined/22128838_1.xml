<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi>, is a highly selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> with anti-NHL activity; it is currently FDA approved for second-line treatment of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> exerts its activity in part through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and also by the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>.We previously validated CD22 as a potential target in treating NHL and have shown that the anti-CD22 ligand blocking antibody, HB22.7, has significant independent lymphomacidal properties in NHL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft models</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether or not these agents would work synergistically to enhance cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that treatment of NHL cell lines with HB22.7 six hours prior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> significantly diminished cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects were not seen when the agents were administered alone or when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> was administered prior to HB22.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, HB22.7 treatment prior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in part through enhanced ROS generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, in a mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e>, administration of HB22.7 followed 24 hours later by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> resulted in 23% smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volumes and 20% enhanced survival compared to treatment with the reverse sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite the increased efficacy of HB22.7 treatment followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>, there was no corresponding decrease in peripheral blood cell counts, indicating no increase in toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that pre-treatment with HB22.7 increases <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> cytotoxicity, in part through increased reactive oxygen species and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and that this sequential treatment combination has robust efficacy in vivo </plain></SENT>
