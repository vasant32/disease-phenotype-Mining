<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Open reading frame BRLF1 was found to be expressed in two modifications in vivo, with molecular sizes ranging from 94 to 98 kilodaltons (kDa) depending on the cell line, whereas only one protein (Raji cells, 96 kDa) was detected by in vitro translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Open reading frame BZLF1 encoded <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> of 38 and 35 kDa and additional smaller forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A BZLF1-encoded 30-kDa protein could be detected under conditions in which expression was restricted to immediate early genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear localization could be detected under conditions in which expression was restricted to immediate early genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nuclear localization could be shown for the proteins derived from reading frames BZLF1 and BMLF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMLF1 expression gave a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> protein pattern, with molecular sizes between 45 and 70 kDa, including a predominant 60-kDa protein detected in different B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
