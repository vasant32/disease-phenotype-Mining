<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Euphorbia tirucalli was especially noticeable in highly endemic areas of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), an EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, in Kenya and Tanzania </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activation of the latent EBV genome and the EBV-induced transformation enhancement were also observed with the soil and drinking water taken around the plants, strongly indicating that the people living in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> endemic areas are frequently exposed to such an EBV-enhancing plant promoter substance </plain></SENT>
