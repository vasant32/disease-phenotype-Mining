<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular identification of genes involved in genetic alterations has led to the characterization of fusion genes with neoplastic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, for many nonrandom translocations including the dic(9;12)(p11-13;p11-12), the molecular equivalent has not as yet been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dicentric translocation dic(9;12) is a recurrent chromosome abnormality that accounts for close to 1% of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This specific alteration occurs almost exclusively in B-progenitor ALL, and unlike many other nonrandom translocations, is associated with an excellent prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this work, we provide strong evidence that the PAX5/ETV6 fusion transcript defines the clinical and biological entity that is associated with the presence of a dic(9;12) chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As the PAX5 and ETV6 genes are localized at 9p13 and 12p13, respectively, the cytogenetic description of the dic(9;12)-PAX5/ETV6 rearrangement should be refined to dic(9;12)(p13;p13) </plain></SENT>
