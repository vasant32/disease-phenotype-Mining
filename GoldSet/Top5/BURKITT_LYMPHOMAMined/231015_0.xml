<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although ADCC titers to EBV-MA were not useful in predicting which patients would relapse there was a definite relationship between ADCC titer and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The individual differences in ADCC titers in patients in remission may explain the variability of responses that have been reported in studies on serotherapy with remission plasma </plain></SENT>
