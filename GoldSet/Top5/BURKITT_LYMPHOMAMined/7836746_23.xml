<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we described human gamma delta CTL that recognize the autologous B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that these gamma delta CTL lyse heterologous cells transfected with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> Ig lambda chain gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the lambda chain is recognized as processed <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in an Id-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T cell recognition does not involve classical MHC molecules, but it could be blocked by Abs directed against the heat shock protein grp75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings show a specific gamma delta T cell response to a highly polymorphic Ag such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> Id and implicate heat shock protein as a molecule required for recognition </plain></SENT>
