<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> lines corresponding to follicular, mantle-cell and Burkitt-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> display type-specific signalosome organizations that differentially activate PI3K, Syk and STAT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line, PI3K, Syk and STAT3 were optimally activated upon association with the Lyn-Cbp/PAG signalosome, while in the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived line, the association with Cbp/PAG and activation of PI3K were interfered with by the latent membrane proteins encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the Jeko-1 mantle-cell line, a weak association of Syk with the Lyn-Cbp/PAG signalosome resulted in poor activation of Syk, but in those cells, as in the follicular and Burkitt-derived lines, efficient <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction by the Syk inhibitor R406 indicated that Syk is nonetheless an important prosurvival element and therefore a valuable therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> configurations described herein is the Lyn-Cbp/PAG signalosome independent of external signals and provides efficient means of activation for its associated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and protein kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In follicular and Burkitt-derived lines, Syk appears to be activated following binding to Cbp/PAG and no longer requires B-cell receptor-associated activation motifs for activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Assessment of the different modalities of Lyn-Cbp/PAG signalosome organization could help in selecting the appropriate combination of kinase inhibitors to eliminate a particular type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
