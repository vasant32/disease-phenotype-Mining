<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three out of five human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines, ACHN, HMV-1, and QG-90, were highly susceptible to IFN-gamma: the concentrations required to inhibit 50% of the growth of cells (IC50) of ACHN, HMV-1, and QG-90 were 26, 11 and 7 pM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IFN-alpha 2a also markedly inhibited the growth of ACHN, HMV-1 and Daudi cells: the values of IC50 for the former and latter cells were 20, 31 and 0.8 pM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With these susceptible cells, larger amounts of IFN-gamma were bound than with resistant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, IFN-alpha 2a bound <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines, irrespective of the susceptibilities of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The values of the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of binding of both IFNs ranged from 1.3 to 7.3 x 10(-10) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The competitive binding test revealed that the binding properties of IFN-gamma were different from those of IFN-alpha 2a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under the present experimental condition, it could be said that, with IFN-gamma, the susceptibilities of cells were linked of the expression of the receptors, but there were some exceptions with IFN-alpha 2a </plain></SENT>
