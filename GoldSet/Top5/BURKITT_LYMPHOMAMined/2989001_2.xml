<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Null and plasma cell lines of malignant origin were evaluated for their ability to produce plasminogen activator (PA) in the 125I-fibrinolysis assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cell lines produced PA at varying extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PA was detected in cell-free conditioned medium as well as in cell lysates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fibrinolysis due to PA was dependent on the presence of plasminogen in the medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PA purified by affinity chromatography not only abrogated cytotoxicity of peripheral blood lymphocytes significantly, but also the lysis of autologous EBV-transformed cells by in vitro generated cytotoxic lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that PA produced by malignant cells could inhibit host cellular immunity, thus providing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells with an escape mechanism from host defences </plain></SENT>
