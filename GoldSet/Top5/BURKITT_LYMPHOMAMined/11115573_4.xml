<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed at defining the occurrence of circulating antibodies to p53 protein in patients with various types of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Altogether, the sera of 108 cases with various histological types of NHL and of 20 healthy controls were assessed for the presence of antibodies to p53 protein with an ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 73 cases of NHL, also the immunohistochemical staining for p53 antigen was performed to make a rough estimation of the frequency of mutational events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The development of autoantibodies to p53 protein was observed in approximately 7% of NHL patients (predominantly in the more aggressive variants of the disease, but also in one case of small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This proportion represents roughly one third of the number of patients assessed (immunohistochemically) to carry a missense p53 mutation in their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The autoantibodies to p53 protein can be used as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker (early appearance, high specificity) in the follow-up of a subset of NHL patients, but, unfortunately, this subset comprises only approximately 7% of NHL patients </plain></SENT>
