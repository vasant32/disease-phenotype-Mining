<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The replication of active and inactivated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> viruses in Daudi <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was studied by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, we demonstrated that active and heat-inactivated X47 (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30092,30093,30094,30095">H3N2</z:chebi>) virus arrested Daudi cell growth by inhibiting cellular DNA synthesis while formalin-treated X47 virus did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that both the active and the heat-inactivated X47 virus penetrated into the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only the active X47 (XA) virus replicated completely in Daudi cells and produced new <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> particles by budding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The formalin-treated X47 virus did not damage or change the cells, and although the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> particles remained adsorbed to the cells, there was little penetration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The heat inactivated X47 virus (which was the most effective, non-virulent, oncolytic agent we studied) was visualized as large aggregates of particles adsorbed to the cell surface by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cells themselves formed clumps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> aggregation and cell clumping likely resulted from the loss of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> neuraminidase activity due to heat treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The penetration of heat-inactivated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> particles was massive and involved numerous particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Production of new <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> particles was not demonstrated in this study even though nucleocapsids from the original virus were found in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, it appears that the massive penetration of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> particles into cells damages the plasma membrane and may be responsible for the oncolytic potential of the heat-inactivated virus on Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
