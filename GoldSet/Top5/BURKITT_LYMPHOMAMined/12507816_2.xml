<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address the putative role of antigen in the clonal expansion of these neoplastic B cells, we analyzed the VHDJH and VLJL gene segments expressed by the established cell lines derived from six endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and six <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines used genes of the VH3 family, two of the VH4, and two of the VH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight VL chains were kappa (four members of the V kappa3, two of the V kappa1, and two of the V kappa2 subgroups) and four lambda (three members of the V lambda1 and one of the Vl ambda3 subgroup) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The VH gene utilization was stochastic (i.e., it reflected the relative representation of the different VH gene family members in the human haploid genome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the VL gene utilization was skewed toward the overutilization of the V kappa3 and V lambda1 gene subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When compared with those of the respective germline genes, the sequences of the expressed Ig VDJ genes displayed nucleotide differences that resulted from somatic hypermutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three endemic and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, nucleotide changes yielding amino acid substitutions segregated within the complementarity determining region, indicating the application of a positive pressure for replacement mutations and suggesting that these neoplastic lymphocytes underwent a process of clonal selection driven by antigen, perhaps emerging from or transitioning through germinal centers </plain></SENT>
