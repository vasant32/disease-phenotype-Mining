<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the high incidence of EBV-associated diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLCL) in HIV-1 infection is believed to be related to loss of immune control due to HIV-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo>, it has been claimed that cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses to EBV are longer lasting in HIV-1-infected persons than CTL directed against HIV-1 itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We approached this apparent paradox by performing the first longitudinal study into the kinetics of EBV and HIV-specific CTL responses in HIV-infected patients progressing either to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infection</z:e> (OI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple samples were tested from HIV-1 seroconversion to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four out of six patients that were either long-term asymptomatic or progressing to OI showed declining HIV-1 CTL precursor (CTLp) frequencies whereas EBV-CTLp remained stable, suggestive for HIV-1-specific immune exhaustion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two patients rapidly progressing to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-OI, a parallel decline of HIV-1- and EBV-CTL responses was seen, indicative for total collapse of cellular immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these six patients EBV-load remained low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in four out of five patients that progressed to DLCL, EBV-load was high and increasing several months preceding the NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients, EBV-CTLp decreased before the emergence of the NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data show that in HIV-1 infection loss of HIV-1-specific T cell immunity is not necessarily paralleled by loss of EBV-specific T cell responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related DLCL is preceded by decreasing EBV-CTLp and increasing EBV load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Failing EBV-control might therefore be an important step in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related DLCL </plain></SENT>
