<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The t(1;19)(q23;p13.3) is one of the most common chromosomal abnormalities in B-cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (BCP-ALL) and usually gives rise to the TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additional rare, and sometimes cytogenetically cryptic, translocations involving the TCF3 gene have also been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a dual color split-signal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe, we have investigated the involvement of this gene in a series of BCP-ALLs harboring 19p13 translocations, as well as an unselected patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TCF3 gene was shown to be involved in the majority of cases with a cytogenetically visible t(1;19) translocation, while the remaining TCF3-negative ALLs demonstrated breakpoint <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although most "other" 19p13 translocations did not produce a split-signal FISH pattern, a novel t(13;19)(q14;p13) involving TCF3 was discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A prospective screen of 161 children with BCP-ALL revealed a cryptic t(12;19)(p13;p13), another novel TCF3 rearrangement, and a series of patients with submicroscopic deletions of TCF3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the utility of a split-signal FISH strategy in confirming the involvement of the TCF3 gene in 19p13 rearrangements and in identifying novel and cryptic TCF3 translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to its role as a fusion partner gene, we propose that TCF3 can also act as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene in BCP-ALL </plain></SENT>
