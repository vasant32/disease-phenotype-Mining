<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>DNA replication of 2 human lymphoid cell lines (U296 and Raji), latently infected with the Epstein-Barr virus, has been compared using a density transfer approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Typical of non-malignant lymphoblastoid cells, U296 cells divided once in bromodeoxyuridine-supplemented medium to form hybrid but not heavy-density host DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Replication of the intracellular Epstein-Barr virus DNA was selectively inhibited in these cells with only 15% of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomes duplicating once to form hybrid-density <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, some heavy-density <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA was formed in the U296 cells and DNA synthesis can thus initiate again on newly duplicated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomes in cells that have traversed only a single S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results contrast strongly with observations concerning the Burkitt-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cells are not growth-inhibited and most of the latent Epstein-Barr virus genomes of the Raji line replicated once, and only once, in successive S phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While the majority of the 50 Epstein-Barr virus genomes of both the Raji and U296 cell lines are maintained as extra-chromosomal DNA plasmids, the control of their duplication is distinctly different in the respective malignant and non-malignant host cells </plain></SENT>
