<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An accurate assessment of these populations is required to avoid false negative measurements of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) in follow-up bone marrow (BM) samples of ALL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analysed 29 ALL patients with two or more immunoglobulin heavy (IGH) chain gene rearrangements in the presentation samples using IGH fingerprinting PCR and sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine (51%) of 76 sequences (from 15 patients), shared no VNDNJ homology (ie different CDR3 regions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 14 patients, at least two related VH sequences were identified in each patient (identical DNJ sequences) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Numerical abnormalities of chromosome 14 was detected in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were analysed at presentation and relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In four of them, expansion of a minor presentation-clone was detected at relapse while the major presentation clone disappeared, confirming 'subclonal evolution' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, in our cohort of patients, the presence of related or unrelated IGH clones did not influence overall survival </plain></SENT>
