<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HIV-based lentiviral vectors were pseudotyped with four different envelope proteins; amphotropic murine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> virus (ampho), murine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> virus (10A1), feline endogenous virus (RD114), and the vesicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> virus <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (VSVG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These pseudotypes were examined for transduction efficiency in human bone marrow derived MSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of lentiviral expression of truncated soluble vascular endothelial growth factor decoy receptor (tsFlk-1) in MSC on growth of Raji cells was determined, both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lentiviral vectors produced significant levels of transduction at an multiplicity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (MOI) of 1, those bearing the RD114 envelope <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> consistently produced higher transduction levels (mean 70 +/- 6%) compared with the other pseudotyped lentiviral vectors, although there was significant inter-donor variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stable transgene expression was achieved after multiple rounds of transduction with VSVG-pseudotyped particles, without alteration in the differentiative capacity of transduced cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Co-injection of MSC stably expressing tsFlk-1 with Raji Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells significantly impaired subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> in immunodeficient mice when compared to controls where either unmanipulated MSC or GFP-expressing MSC were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Human MSC are easily transduced by pseudotyped lentiviral particles but there is inter-donor variation in transduction efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gene-modified MSC expressing a gene of therapeutic potential can moderate growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
