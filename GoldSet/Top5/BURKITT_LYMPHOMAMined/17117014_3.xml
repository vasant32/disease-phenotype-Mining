<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic abnormalities, known to play a major role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of non-immunocompromised patients, are not well characterized in ARL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Characterization of the DNA copy number change (<z:chebi fb="31" ids="48390">CNC</z:chebi>) in ARL and comparison of our findings with tumoral EBV and immune status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We have studied by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), 28 ARL well characterized for histopathologic, clonality and EBV findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DNA-<z:chebi fb="31" ids="48390">CNC</z:chebi> were detected in 50% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gains of chromosomal material were much more frequent than losses and involved chromosomes 9p, 11q, 12q, 17q, and 19q recurrently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA-<z:chebi fb="31" ids="48390">CNC</z:chebi> tended to be more frequent in EBV-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with latency type II/III than in EBV-positive latency I or EBV-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most chromosomal regions affected in HIV-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were similar to those already reported in HIV-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This CGH study allowed the identification of non-random chromosomal alterations in ARL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggested an inverse relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> (latency II/III), associated with deep acquired immune suppression, and the number of chromosomal alterations which may be explained by a direct role of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> proteins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> by activation of signalling pathways without needing several genomic alterations </plain></SENT>
