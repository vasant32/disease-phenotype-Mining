<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> in modulating the response of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to ionizing radiation (IR) in vitro and explored the mechanisms that mediated this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We treated three Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines with vehicle, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>, IR, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> in combination with IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell viability, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and cell cycle distribution were determined to ascertain the radiosensitization effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation was assessed by nuclear translocation of p65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins were monitored by western blot assay and real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> sensitized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to IR-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and increased G2/M phase arrest in the cell cycle distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the antiapoptotic Bcl-xL protein, cell cycle modulating protein CDC2, and cyclin B1 were downregulated by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IR activated NF-κB as evidenced by an increased nuclear p65 translocation and cytoplasmic IκBα expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> significantly decreased the nuclear translocation of p65 and cytoplasmic IκBα degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survivin and hexokinase II, downstream effectors of NF-κB that mediate the antiapoptotic effect of NF-κB, were suppressed by the pretreatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the activated NF-κB pathway plays a prosurvival role in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in response to IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> blocks this pathway and has therapeutic potential for improving the antitumor effects of radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
