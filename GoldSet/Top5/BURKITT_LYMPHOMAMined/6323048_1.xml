<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A wide range of concentrations (4-16 ng/ml) of teleocidin were optimal for induction of replication of latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes in P3HR-1 cells; cell growth was significantly inhibited in this dose range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, treatment of Raji cells with an identical dose range of teleocidin did not induce replication of latent EBV genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, P3HR-1 cells in the stationary phase were twice as responsive to teleocidin induction as exponentially growing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The activation of P3HR-1 cells both by teleocidin and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> greatly enhanced the synthesis of EBV DNA and EBV-associated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> as determined by cRNA - DNA hybridization and by analysis on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both drugs also increased production of biologically active virus as monitored by the synthesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA in superinfected Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects were completely inhibited by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> did not inhibit the spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA replication that occurs in P3HR-1 cells not treated with the inducers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, it appears that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> antagonizes the inducing effects of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> and teleocidin, but not <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication itself </plain></SENT>
