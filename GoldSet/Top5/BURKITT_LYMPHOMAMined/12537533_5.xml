<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ionizing radiation at clinically relevant doses may increase the amount of virus reactivation in B cells, and the combination of radiation with stress could amplify EBV reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments were performed on several cell lines, including EBV-positive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of the immediate-early protein ZEBRA, which is a hallmark of EBV reactivation, was evaluated using flow cytometry, which enabled us to measure the percentage of ZEBRA-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The process was studied previously in the EBV-positive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line B95-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after irradiation alone, 13.6 and 19.9% ZEBRA-positive cells were observed at 2 and 4 Gy, respectively, compared to the basal level of 1.85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus irradiation induces EBV reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The addition of a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> (the final effector of the stress response) had no effect on EBV reactivation in our model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the combination of radiation and treatment with a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>) increased the expression of ZEBRA in B95-8 cells (15.8 and 28.75% of the cells was positive at 24 and 48 h after gamma irradiation, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus the combination of gamma radiation and a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> may play an important role in EBV reactivation </plain></SENT>
