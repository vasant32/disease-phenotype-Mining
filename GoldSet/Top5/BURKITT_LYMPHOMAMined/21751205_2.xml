<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine whether epoetin alpha would decrease the number of transfusion events and units of packed erythrocytes (PRBCs) transfused, and the secondary objective was to study the effects of epoetin alpha on quality of life (QOL) and complete remission (CR) rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LL), or Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) who were receiving frontline myelosuppressive chemotherapy were randomized to receive epoetin alpha or no epoetin during the first 6 cycles of their planned chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>QOL was assessed by using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and the Functional Assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Therapy (FACT)-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were randomized to receive epoetin alpha, and 54 patients received no epoetin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transfusion data were available for 79 of 81 evaluable patients (98%) who completed the treatment/observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The trial was stopped early because of poor accrual before the target of 123 evaluable patients was met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A mean of 10.6 units of PRBCs over 5 months were administered to those who received epoetin alpha compared with 13 units for those who did not receive epoetin (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in QOL as assessed by the FACT-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> or ESAS instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CR rate and the 3-year CR duration were not affected adversely by use of epoetin alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Epoetin alpha decreased the number of PRBC transfusions and did not appear to have a negative impact on remission duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No difference in QOL was observed </plain></SENT>
