<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Binding of the antibodies to Ig receptors on the surface was shown to induce changes in the fluorescence polarization of the probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The high sensitivity of the method allows one to detect less than 100 antibody molecules per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The possibility of using cells or liposomes carrying antigens and fluorescent <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> for the determination of antibodies in solution is discussed </plain></SENT>
