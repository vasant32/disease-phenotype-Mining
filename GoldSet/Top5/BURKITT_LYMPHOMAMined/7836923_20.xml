<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Activated c-myc gene was introduced into the cells of three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive lymphoblastoid B cell lines (LCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells were monitored for the appearance of new phenotypic and functional features compared with the control LCL cells transfected with plasmid that did not contain the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LCL-expressing c-myc constitutively did not arrest growth in low serum concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the cell number in the cultures failed to increase because of substantial cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> was due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi>-stained cells, by typical DNA laddering in gel electrophoresis, and by the inspection of Giemsa-stained cell smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was also induced by exposing the transfected cells to antibodies directed to the immunoglobulin mu chain (a-mu-ab) irrespective of the serum concentration in the culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure of the cells to CD40 ligand (CD40L) or CD40 monoclonal antibody prevented cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Upon transfection with c-myc, the LCL cells acquired a vacuolated <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> that was never observed in control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the expression of CD10 and CD38 was upregulated, while that of CD39 and especially CD23 was downregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unlike that observed in certain Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines that share the same surface phenotype (CD10+CD38+CD23-CD39-), the c-myc-transfected cells expressed lymphocyte function-associated (LFA) 1, LFA-3, and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 and grew in large clumps rather than single-cell layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD10 and CD38 was particularly evident on the cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, thus suggesting a correlation between the presence of these markers and the apoptotic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cells placed in conditions favoring in vitro <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> displayed downregulation of Bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 expression was, however, upregulated when the cells were exposed to CD40L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the B cells expressing c-myc constitutively acquire some of the features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> centroblasts and of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, including the expression of CD10 and CD38, and the propensity to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which can be prevented by exposure to CD40L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these cells can serve as a model system to study both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> as well as the process of B cell selection occurring in the germinal centers </plain></SENT>
