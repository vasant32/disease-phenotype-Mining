<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines were studied for their response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27899">cis-diamminedichloroplatinum</z:chebi>(II) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27899">cis-DDP</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17295,29997">L-phenylalanine</z:chebi> mustard (L-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi>) with the objective of relating cytotoxicity to DNA cross-linking in human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity was measured by cell proliferation and colony formation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA interstrand and DNA-protein cross-linking were measured by alkaline elution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of the cell lines showed quantitative agreement between cytotoxicity and DNA cross-linking assays following treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27899">cis-DDP</z:chebi> or L-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation with DNA-protein cross-linking was not as good as with interstrand cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the third cell line, cytotoxicity and interstrand cross-linking were correlated in response to L-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi> but not in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27899">cis-DDP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When this line was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27899">cis-DDP</z:chebi>, cross-linking was low, but cytotoxicity was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This line differed from the other two lines in that, following treatment with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27899">cis-DDP</z:chebi> or L-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi>, substantial cell lysis or disruption occurred 12 to 14 hr following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results are consistent with a general correlation between DNA cross-linking and cytotoxicity in human cells treated with bifunctional agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An exceptional cell type, however, is described which appears to have a reduced tolerance to certain types of DNA damage, the reduced tolerance being expressed by early cell lysis or disruption </plain></SENT>
