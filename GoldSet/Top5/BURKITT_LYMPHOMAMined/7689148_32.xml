<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transcription factor E2F binds to cellular promoters of certain growth- and cell cycle-controlling genes and forms distinct heteromeric complexes with other nuclear proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show here that alpha and beta interferons (alpha, beta) and interleukin-6 abolished the E2F-containing DNA-binding complexes in Daudi Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and in M1 myeloblastic cells, which responded to the cytokines by suppression of c-myc transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Time kinetics studies showed that the abolishment of E2F complexes coincided with reduction of c-myc expression and that both molecular events preceded the cell cycle block in G0/G1 phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the pattern of E2F complexes remained unchanged in an interferon-treated growth-resistant Daudi cell mutant that displayed relaxed regulation of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the DNA-binding E2F complexes, including those containing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein (pRB), cyclin A-p33cdk2, and the free forms of E2F, were reduced by interferons or interleukin-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their abolishment was unperturbed by pharmacological treatments that alleviated the cyclin A and pRB responses to interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, changes in cyclin A expression and pRB phosphorylation are not primary events that influence the pattern of E2F responses to cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Addition of EDTA to cell extracts of interferon-treated Daudi cells restored the DNA-binding activity of E2F, resulting in the appearance of a single E2F complex that exclusively contained pRB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the regulation of E2F by growth-inhibitory cytokines that induce cell cycle exit takes place at the level of the DNA-binding activity, and by that mean it differs basically from the phase-specific regulation of E2F in cycling cells </plain></SENT>
