<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 75% of the sera fixed complement with the positive cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These lines contained the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e>-like virus detectable by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The content of CF antigen depended on the cell line used but appeared to be independent of the number of cells which produced Henle's immunofluorescence (IF) antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only sera that reacted in the IF test also contained CF antibodies to the crude cell extracts </plain></SENT>
