<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recurrent genetic abnormalities include rearrangements involving MYC (8q24), BCL2 (18q21) and BCL6 (3q27); as the prognostic and therapeutic implications associated with these abnormalities are clarified their accurate identification at diagnosis is becoming increasingly critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe our experience of using a panel of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) probes on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections in the diagnostic work-up of 162 patients with non-Burkitt high grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (HG-BNHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BCL6, IGH-BCL2 and MYC status were determined prospectively in sequential patients presenting with HG-BNHL, with respect to the presence of rearrangements and copy number changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Small numbers of samples were analysed retrospectively or were studied at relapse in previously untested patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FISH analysis was successful in 160/162 (99%) cases, with abnormalities detected in 118/160 (74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FISH analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections is a highly reproducible technique with an excellent success rate for the detection of genetic abnormalities which will play an increasingly important role in improving risk stratification of patients with HG-BNHL </plain></SENT>
