<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> antigen (WT1) contributes to a graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (GVL) effect after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), we studied CD8(+) T-cell responses to WT1 in 10 human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201-positive ALL patients during the early phase of immune recovery after SCT (days 30-120) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven of 10 patients had detectable WT1 expression in their peripheral blood (PB) before SCT by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using WT1/HLA-A*0201 tetramers and intracellular interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) staining, WT1(+) CD8(+) T-cell responses after SCT were found only in patients with detectable WT1 expression before SCT (5 of 7 vs. 0 of 3; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To monitor the kinetics of WT1(+) CD8(+) T-cell responses and disease regression after SCT, absolute WT1(+) CD8(+) T-cell numbers and WT1 expression were studied for each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The emergence of WT1(+) CD8(+) T cells was associated with a decrease in WT1 expression, suggesting a WT1-driven GVL effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Loss of WT1(+) CD8(+) T-cell responses was associated with reappearance of WT1 transcripts, consistent with a molecular relapse (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WT1(+) CD8(+) T cells had a predominantly effector-memory phenotype (CD45RO(+) CD27(-)CD57(+)) and produced IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results support the immunogenicity of WT1 after SCT for ALL and highlight the potential for WT1 vaccines to boost GVL after SCT for ALL </plain></SENT>
