<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Currently, there is very little information from Uganda as to the range and prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026636" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral diseases</z:e> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of these studies focus on prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000689'>malocclusions</z:hpo>, and trauma to teeth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the epidemiology of oral maxillofacial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is variable between regions yet there are no publications on this entity in the pediatric population available from Uganda, the authors of this study decided to carry out the first Ugandan retrospective survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> entries for specimens from children between the ages of 0 and 16 years during the 5-year period from 2006 to 2010 were retrieved and compiled into five diagnostic categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 610 (29.33%) specimens came from children between the ages of 0 and 16 years, with a male to female ratio of 1.29:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic category with the largest number of specimens was malignant (61.08%), followed by inflammatory/reactive lesions (16.07%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086692" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">benign tumors</z:e> (12.13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, there were 51 benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of non-odontogenic origin and 23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100612'>odontogenic tumors</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequently diagnosed lesions were Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which accounted for over 55.24% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was followed by irritation <z:hpo ids='HP_0010614'>fibromas</z:hpo> that accounted for 5.74% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This survey shows that, while nearly 29% of cases biopsied at the authors' unit are from children under 16 years of age, the majority of lesions are malignant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> took up the lion's share; this entity requires chemotherapeutic treatment, hence there is need to strengthen medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100612'>Odontogenic tumors</z:hpo> are relatively rare in this age group; however, certain lesions such as adenomatoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100612'>odontogenic tumor</z:hpo> are common in children and therefore should be considered when we have failed maxillary canine eruption </plain></SENT>
