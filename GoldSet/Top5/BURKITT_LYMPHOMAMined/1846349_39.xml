<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoblots of cell lysates were probed with polyspecific and monospecific antisera directed against EBNA 1, 2, 3 and 6, and the membrane protein LMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> expressed EBNA 1 and LMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBNA 2 was detected in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of 8 patients, and EBNA 3 and 6 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LMP regulatory sequences, 5' of the LMP gene, were totally unmethylated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 cases, while the coding sequences of LMP and EBNA 2 were more methylated in CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) express EBNA 1 to 6 and LMP; in contrast, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> express only EBNA 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments have shown that EBNA 2, 3 and LMP can generate targets for cytotoxic T cells (CTL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These combined observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> of the BMT recipients escapes CTL-mediated rejection due to the failure of host immunosurveillance rather than to the down-regulation of immunogenic EBV-encoded antigens </plain></SENT>
