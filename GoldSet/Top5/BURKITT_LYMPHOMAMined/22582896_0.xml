<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> therapy continues to present a major challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even though cytotoxic therapy, immunotherapy and molecularly targeted therapy have been used in the clinic to treat the disease, effective anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> drugs are still needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we explored novel anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> agents and found that scutellarin, an active component of a traditional Chinese medicinal herb Erigeron breviscapus, executed an anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scutellarin diminished the proliferation of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Namalwa cells in vitro and inhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> growth in Namalwa cell-xenotransplanted mice without obvious toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mechanism study showed that scutellarin at doses of less than 10 μM induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 transition without the induction of cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which was accompanied by down-regulation of cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, scutellarin at concentrations of 15 μM or above promoted Namalwa cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which was partially associated with the activation of caspases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that scutellarin is a new potential anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> candidate </plain></SENT>
