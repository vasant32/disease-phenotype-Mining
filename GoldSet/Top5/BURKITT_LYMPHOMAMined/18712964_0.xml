<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the spectrum of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in our set up, according to the WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the cases diagnosed as malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, during the year 2005, were retrieved from the institution based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> registry record and classified according to WHO criteria depending on the immunohistochemical results of a panel of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The male to female ratio was 2.5:1 for almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age range was 3 to 80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were higher amongst the children, whereas follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> were more frequently reported in 5th, 6th and 7th decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the total cases 62% were nodal and 38% extranodal (majority in the GI tract) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was more (73%) frequent than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mixed cellularity and nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> were the main histological variants of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemistry is not very frequently used in our set up and also at very few other centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, its application should be encouraged to raise the quality of data on lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and contribute to their control </plain></SENT>
