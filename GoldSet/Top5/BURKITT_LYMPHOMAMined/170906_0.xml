<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We had the opportunity to carry out light and electron microscopic investigations of three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in immature rhesus monkeys from our colony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> of both retroperitoneum and lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relatively uniform lymphoblastic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0475799" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoreticular tumour</z:e> cells as well as the massive occurence of the so-called "starry sky macrophages" were histologically characteristic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histochemically, the marked pyroninophilia of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The electron nicroscopy revealed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells as lymphoblasts of about 8 mu diameter with the following features: round or oval, occasionally deeply indented cell nuclei with relatively clear interchromatinic substance; mostly well developed nucleoli; sparsely, rough endoplasmatic reticulum; large numbers of free ribosomes and polyribosomes; a few large, bizzarre mitochondria, often situated at one pole; <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> vacuoles in some cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These histological, cytological and electron microscopic characteristics correspond to those of the human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> is classified as an undifferentiated malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumours</z:e> of this type are of particular interest on comparative and epidemiological reasons in light of the existence of morphologically similar experimental, virus induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in monkeys </plain></SENT>
