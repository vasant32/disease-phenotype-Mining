<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two assay methods used for measuring ara-C concentrations (high-pressure liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay) gave much the same results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peak plasma ara-C concentrations (2.0 microM) after high-dose therapy were 50 times those achieved with more conventional (100 to 300 mg/m2) doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High doses of ara-C were not sufficient to saturate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase; plasma ara-C half-lifes (t1/2) after high-dose therapy (distribution t1/2 = 6.2 min; elimination t1/2 = 154 min) were much the same as those after conventional ara-C doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kinetics of ara-C were not altered by repeated dosing over a 6-day period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid ara-C concentrations after high-doses (mean = 7.8 microM) were 10 times those after conventional intravenous dosing, bot were 0.5% to 1.0% those achieved by intrathecal ara-C doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tear concentrations of 22 and 38 micro M were measured in two patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>conjunctivitis</z:hpo> after high-dose therapy so that the presence of ara-C in tears may be a cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>conjunctivitis</z:hpo> seen in some patients </plain></SENT>
