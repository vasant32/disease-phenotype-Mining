<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of hybrids derived from a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, with a translocation breakpoint in the oncogene c-myc, shows that the Tg gene is located distal from c-myc, towards the telomere of the long arm of chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The finding of two high frequency restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in the 5' part of the Tg gene results in heterozygosity for at least one marker at chromosome 8, band q24, in 50% of a Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These RFLPs cannot only be used for the study of inborn errors in Tg synthesis but also for linkage studies in the telomeric region of chromosome 8q </plain></SENT>
