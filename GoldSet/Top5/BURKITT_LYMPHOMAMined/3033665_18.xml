<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have cloned the translocation-associated MYC gene from the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (BL2) with a t(8;22) chromosomal translocation and have determined the nucleotide sequence of the first exon and of the 3' and 5' flanking regions, where sequences with putative regulatory functions have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide sequence of the 5' flanking region, which contains regions of DNase hypersensitivity and binding sites for putative regulatory proteins, is the same as that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, mutations in these regulatory regions are not required for the transcriptional deregulation of MYC in the BL2 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide sequence of the first exon is similar to that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MYC [Gazin, C., Dupont de Direchin, S., Hampe, A., Masson, J </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, six nucleotide changes that occur in the middle of this reading frame could result in amino acid substitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also have cloned and sequenced the t(8;22) chromosomal breakpoint that is located 10 kilobases 3' of the MYC exon 3 and near the C lambda 3 gene on chromosome 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sequences with homology to immunoglobulin joining signals occur close to the breakpoint both on chromosome 8 and 22, providing further evidence that the immunoglobulin joining enzymes may be involved in the recombinations associated with a variety of chromosomal translocations in B and T cells </plain></SENT>
