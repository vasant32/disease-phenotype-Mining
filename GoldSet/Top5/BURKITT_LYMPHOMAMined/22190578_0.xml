<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme indicated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor lysis syndrome</z:e> (TLS), a potential life-threatening oncologic emergency that occurs most commonly during chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result of the defects in the physiological <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> pathway, erythrocytes of patients with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are not protected against the oxidating stress exerted by <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> generated with the administration of rasburicase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">G6PD deficiency</z:e> and the manufacturer recommends screening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">G6PD deficiency</z:e> before initiating rasburicase therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it is logistically difficult in clinical settings because of the high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with TLS if treatment is delayed and the long turnaround time of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">G6PD deficiency</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, administering rasburicase to patients developing TLS before confirming a patient's G6PD status is practically inevitable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012119'>Methemoglobinemia</z:hpo>, and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp>, may result from the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Descriptions of the clinical course should it happen are limited in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There are eight reported cases of rasburicase-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0012119'>methemoglobinemia</z:hpo>, with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, in the literature of which five are pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six reports (including three pediatric patients) had detailed descriptions of the event and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The recent reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012119'>methemoglobinemia</z:hpo> observed in patients with probable G6PD activity further complicated the picture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We are reporting a 16-year-old patient diagnosed with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0012119'>methemoglobinemia</z:hpo> after receiving one dose of rasburicase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>He was managed by transfusion and oxygen support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patient recovered well and the observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0012119'>methemoglobinemia</z:hpo> was reversible </plain></SENT>
