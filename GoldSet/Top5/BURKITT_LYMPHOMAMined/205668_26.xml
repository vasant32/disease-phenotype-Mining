<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The physical state of the EBV DNA in a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line that only contains one virus genome equivalent per cell has now been studied by three different methods, neutral CsCl density gradient centrifugation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi>-CsCl gradient centrifugation, and Hirt fractionation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cell line, AW-Ramos, has been obtained by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in vitro of the apparently EBV-negative Ramos <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the EBV DNA in AW-Ramos is present exclusively in a linearly integrated form </plain></SENT>
