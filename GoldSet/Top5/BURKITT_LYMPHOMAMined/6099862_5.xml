<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each of these lines carries one of the specific chromosome translocations associated with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but few if any other chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An outline of their molecular organization, as determined by restriction enzyme analysis, is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of the isolates, LY47 and BL8, give patterns broadly similar to Epstein-Barr virus DNA molecules studied to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The third, LY91, shows a highly unusual molecular organization, in particular within BamHI subfragments of the EcoRI A fragment, indicative of the presence of a major defective molecular species within this line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three cell lines produce virions that are capable of transforming immature B-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
