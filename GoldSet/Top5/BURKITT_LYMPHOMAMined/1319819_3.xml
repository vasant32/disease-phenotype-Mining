<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The role of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in lymphoproliferative lesions has been widely accepted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of these lesions occur in patients who have deficiencies in their immune status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphomatoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> (LG) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> originally characterized as an angiocentric, necrotizing, pleomorphic infiltrate of mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The etiology of LG is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was originally hypothesized that LG may represent an unusual lymphoid response to an infective organism, possibly EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tissues from a previously healthy 60-year-old, healthy white man with primary cerebellar lymphomatoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> were examined for the presence of EBV by nucleic acid hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The original LG lesion was a polyclonal B-cell proliferation that contained detectable amounts of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood leukocytes were negative for EBV by the same assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After an 18-month remission, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> reappeared near the site of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesion</z:e>, which had the histologic appearance of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cells showed restricted clonality and contained a similar amount of EBV-related DNA as the original lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood leukocytes at the time of recurrence were negative for EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patient died approximately 2 months after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521158" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent tumor</z:e> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrated the development of a primary cerebellar B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo>, histologically identical to lymphomatoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo>, that transformed into a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and the subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> contained, on average, several copies of EBV-related DNA per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Despite an extensive survey of the patient, no immune deficit was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Interpretation of the literature with the results of this case suggest that this instance of primary cerebellar LG arose as a consequence of an unusual EBV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that EBV may be a significant factor in the initiation of the abnormal proliferations of T-cells or B-cells reported in this disorder </plain></SENT>
