<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lack of resources precludes the use of new successful treatment approaches such as the LMB 89 group B protocol, which cures &gt;80% of children with stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> with high dose chemotherapy and matching supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to achieve a good cure rate in Murphy stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> with manageable toxicity in Malawi at a drug cost of &lt;1000 US dollars per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: The intensity and toxicity of the LMB 89 group B protocol was reduced and adapted to Malawi realities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> stages received the same treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Children with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in the period July 1997-November 1999 were subjected to abdominal ultrasound, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsy and/or fine needle aspirate (FNA) and bone marrow (BM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and peripheral blood examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HIV seropositive children were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endpoints are projected event free survival (EFS) at minimum 1 year, blood and gastro-intestinal tract toxicity, and risk for and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-four children were eligible for treatment and analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 7.2 years, M:F ratio 1.4:1 with 10 stage I, 5 stage II, and 29 stage III patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Projected Kaplan-Meier EFS for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> was 57% (CI 41-73) at 1 year with 90% EFS in stage I and 52% EFS in stage III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The survival curve remained stable at 500 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Toxicity and delays in appropriate supportive care contributed to ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521158" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent tumor</z:e> caused five and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> recurrence one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two children died from progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The incidence of severe (grade 3 and/or 4) hematologic toxicity varied from 13% to 36%, gastro-intestinal toxicity (GIT) from 2% to 17%, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> from 7% to 41% per chemotherapy module </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to administer less intense and less costly multiagent chemotherapy to children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in a developing society with acceptable EFS rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Adequate supportive care of the at-times associated severe toxicity must be made available to better the results </plain></SENT>
