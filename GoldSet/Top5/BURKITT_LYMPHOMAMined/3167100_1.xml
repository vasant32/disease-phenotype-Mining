<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability of targeted liposomes to enhance growth inhibition, which amounted to a 4-fold reduction of the drug concentration required to inhibit cell growth by 50% as compared to nontargeted liposomes, was observed only with cells expressing this ecto-enzyme activity, i.e., Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and RAJI, a Burkitt-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delivery of the encapsulated drugs was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">NH4Cl</z:chebi> and varied with the endocytic capacity of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only small unilamellar vesicles affected the growth of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, whereas the fibroblasts were more sensitive to large unilamellar vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With vesicles of appropriate size, there was a good correlation between the specific binding of the targeted liposomes to cells and drug delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that ecto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>+-glycohydrolase can provide a recognition site on target cells and mediate the internalization of targeted liposomes by a mechanism most probably related to adsorptive endocytosis </plain></SENT>
