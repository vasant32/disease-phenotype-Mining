<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through activation of the CD95-mediated pathway and that CD95 and ligands of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> domain may belong to the group of IFN-stimulated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the effect of IFN-alpha on CD95-CD95L expression, on the release of TNF-alpha, and on TNF receptor 1 expression in an IFN-sensitive human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Daudi) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 5 days' incubation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in 81% of IFN-alpha-treated Daudi cells was preceded by a release of TNF-alpha and an induction of CD95 receptor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although supernatants of IFN-treated Daudi cells induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CD95-sensitive Jurkat cells, CD95L was undetectable on protein or on <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> levels, and the weak initial expression of TNF receptor 1 increased only slightly during IFN treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, binding of TNF-alpha to CD95 was observed and confirmed by 3 different techniques-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using immobilized CD95:Fc-immunoglobulin G, immunoprecipitation assay using CD95 receptor precipitates of Daudi cells, and binding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">sodium iodide</z:chebi> 125-TNF-alpha to Daudi cells, which was strongly stimulated by IFN-alpha and inhibited by CD95L, CD95:Fc, unlabeled TNF-alpha, and anti-TNF-alpha antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preincubation of Daudi cells with <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> of the CD95-mediated pathway resulted in an inhibition of IFN-alpha-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present investigation shows that IFN-alpha induces autocrine cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicide</z:e> of Daudi cells by a cross-talk between the CD95 receptor and TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CD95 receptor can be considered a third TNF receptor, in addition to p55 and p75 </plain></SENT>
