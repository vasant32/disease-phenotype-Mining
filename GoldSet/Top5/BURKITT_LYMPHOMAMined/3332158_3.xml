<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Hoechst dye method, a sensitive assay able to detect 3 log elimination, and a liquid culture assay suitable for identifying an elimination greater than 4 logs, were used to measure malignant cell elimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These assays showed that the separation of bone marrow mononuclear cells on Ficoll-hypaque, the use of beads in excess, and a double treatment of the samples are needed to obtain optimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, the immunomagnetic procedure is capable of depleting 1% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell infiltration at the lower limit of detection of a very sensitive culture assay (i.e. greater than 4 log elimination) </plain></SENT>
