<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiation exposure increased the level of c-jun transcripts in a dose- and time-dependent manner, providing direct evidence that ionizing radiation can activate c-jun protooncogene in human lymphohematopoietic precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Notable gamma-rays failed to induce c-jun expression in cells pretreated with herbimycin, and the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> did not overcome the inhibitory effects of herbimycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lack of c-jun signal in herbimycin-treated cells was not due to nonspecific damage to the distal protein kinase C signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, protein tyrosine kinase activation precedes and perhaps mandates radiation-induced activation of c-jun protooncogene expression in human lymphohematopoietic precursors </plain></SENT>
