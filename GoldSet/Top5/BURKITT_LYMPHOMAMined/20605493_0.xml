<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that the human programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-2 gene (PDCD2), a target of BCL6 repression, is likely to be important in the pathogenesis of certain human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now demonstrate that transfection of a construct expressing PDCD2 induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in human cell lines, that this occurs, at least in part, through activation of the caspase cascade, and, furthermore, that caspase inhibitors block this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies in human benign lymphoid and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissues support these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, transfection of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP16</z:chebi>-BCL6 zinc fingers fusion protein, which competes with the binding of endogenous BCL6 in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, increases PDCD2 protein expression and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and knockdown of the PDCD2 protein in this cell line by PDCD2-specific small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> duplexes inhibits <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that one function of PDCD2 is to promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in several human and mammalian cell lines and tissues, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the pathways involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> are likely to be multiple and complex, it is plausible that repression of PDCD2 expression by BCL6, which, in turn, leads to downregulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, is one mechanism involved in BCL6-associated lymphomatous transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of increasing PDCD2 expression in the treatment of certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> merits further investigation </plain></SENT>
