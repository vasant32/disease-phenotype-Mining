<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Originally identified as a monocyte factor, our studies and those of others have demonstrated that B and T lymphocytes produce TNF-alpha when stimulated by a variety of inducers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here that TNF-alpha gene transcription is rapidly and highly induced in three independently derived human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, as well as in freshly isolated human splenic B cells, activated by antibodies to surface immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This burst in TNF-alpha gene transcription is associated with an induction of TNF-alpha bioactivity in the culture supernatants from stimulated splenic B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, induction of TNF-alpha gene transcription by anti-immunoglobulin was blocked by the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> and FK506 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that TNF-alpha production is an early event in B-cell activation and they establish the efficacy of using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> as probes in dissecting transcriptional activation pathways in human B cells </plain></SENT>
