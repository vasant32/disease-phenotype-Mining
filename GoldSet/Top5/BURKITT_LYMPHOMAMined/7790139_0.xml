<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are common problems in Tropical Africa, including Kenya </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies done in Western populations indicate that 25-50% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have specific or nonspecific cutaneous signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In dark-skinned patients, reports of such mucocutaneous manifestations are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesions in these patients may easily be missed, if not specifically looked for </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Eighty-six indigenous Kenyan children with a confirmed diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were specifically examined for any mucocutaneous manifestations at presentation, during their treatment, and during subsequent follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whenever possible, an attempt was made to determine the causes of these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were given standard therapy for the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two-thirds of the patients had mucocutaneous symptomatology at presentation: 17.4% had skin infiltration by the malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During therapy an even larger number developed nonspecific skin manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of these were the result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>, immunosuppression, or direct cytotoxic effects on tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mucocutaneous manifestations in black children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are very common </plain></SENT>
