<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The 25,000-Da protein that is seen in immunoprecipitates with antibodies to class II MHC molecules or to Ii was shown to be a C-terminal fragment of Ii </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]Methionine pulse-chase labeling of polyclonally activated B lymphocytes or lymphoblastoid cell lines demonstrated maximal appearance of p25 in Percoll-separated endosomal fractions at 20- to 40-min chase times (studies in progress) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding was consistent with the view that proteolysis of Ii to p25 and its release might catalyze the binding of digested foreign <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> to class II molecules and/or govern release of such charged complexes to traffic to the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the structural relationship of p25 to Ii and the basis for cleavage of a relatively restricted site just external to the transmembranal segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]Methionine-labeled Ii and associated molecules were immunoprecipitated with a mAb to native Ii and then denatured, resolubilized, and subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with various antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two antisera to C-terminal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> of Ii (183 to 193 and 192 to 211), but not antibodies to an N-terminal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (12 to 28), did immunoprecipitate p25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The three antibodies to C-terminal and N-terminal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> immunoprecipitated denatured Ii proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mAb to Ii immunoprecipitated [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]methionine-labeled p25 but not [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]cysteine-labeled p25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding was consistent with loss of a portion of Ii containing the only cysteine in Ii, Cys28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Digestion of class II MHC Ag-Ii complexes with various proteases yielded proteins migrating at and near p25 in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Upon increasing the duration of protease digestion, the 25,000-Da fragments were relatively resistant to further digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This observation was consistent with the presence of secondary structures (domains) leaving a relatively protease-sensitive (Ig hinge-like) region in Ii near its insertion into the membrane </plain></SENT>
