<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Antibodies purified from sera of patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by absorption onto and elution from cultured lymphoblastoid cells, were labeled with 125I and repurified by repeating the absorption-elution procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The doubly purified antibodies could bound with a high degree of efficiency to immunoadsorbents prepared by entrapping in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human serum or exudate fluids from patients with ovarian or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Binding was specific, as it could be inhibited by high dilutions of human sera but not by animal sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Globulin fractions of human sera were strongly inhibitory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their capacity to inhibit was lost after treatment with rabbit anti-human IgG serum, indicating that at least part of the inhibition could be ascribed to antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some inhibitory activity was also found, however, in the "albumin" fractions of sera, suggesting that an antigen was also involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It appears, therefore, that practically <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human sera contain antibodies reacting with an antigen(s) which is present on human cells and is also circulating freely in serum and other body fluids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sera of patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> contained, on the average higher concentrations of these antibodies, as compared to sera of individuals not suffering from this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This antigen is thought to be associated with the cell membrane and has been identified in cells of widely differing origin </plain></SENT>
