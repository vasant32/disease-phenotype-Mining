<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most people who have cytotoxic serum are in good health and show no evidence of exposure to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We characterized the serum of a healthy female adult that was highly lytic to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cell line via IgM-activated complement (&gt;60% of malignant cells were killed during the 60-min assay) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complement-dependent lysis was not mediated by other classes of serum antibodies (data not shown) which is consistent with the findings of Ollert et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To identify the target antigen on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells, we fractionated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cell lysates by ion-exchange chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the fraction that showed maximal IgM binding, the dominant protein was identified as the 47-kDa translational elongation factor 1alpha (eEF1alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used the donor's B-cells to create hybridomas producing the antibody (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi>.6.22) that bound to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells and mediated cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This antibody recognized eEF1alpha in a specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the heavy chain of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi>.6.22 showed usage of VH3-23 and JH6 gene segments, with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The structural similarity of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi>.6.22 to antibodies of the innate immune system supports the assumption that natural antibodies are a potential source of therapeutic antibodies </plain></SENT>
