<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis is time-consuming, requires in vitro culture with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> and enables to analyse a relatively small number of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the role of multicolor fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in the rapid detection of t(8:14) in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FISH detected the JH/myc translocation in 100% of the cells of five cell lines carrying the classical t(8:14) and in fresh cells obtained from a newly diagnosed Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the translocation was not detected in the Bajb cell line that does not carry t(8:14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that FISH is a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool for the detection of the JH/myc translocation in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
