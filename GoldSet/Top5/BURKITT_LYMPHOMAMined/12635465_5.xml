<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between 1986 and 2000 183 Austrian children and adolescents with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) were enrolled in 3 consecutive studies of the Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster (BFM) Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In trial NHL-BFM 86, patients were stratified according to the histologic subtype and clinical stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the succeeding studies NHL-BFM 90 and 95, treatment stratification was additionally based on the speed of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response to therapy and for children with B-cell NHL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> also on the pre-therapeutic serum lactic dehydrogenase level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival rates were 84% +/- 6% in trial NHL-BFM 86 (n = 39) and 86% +/- 4% in both trials NHL-BFM 90 (n = 67) and NHL-BFM 95 (n = 77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (mainly with T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotypes</z:mp>) had an excellent prognosis with an ALL-type chemotherapy regimen (n = 49; relapse, n = 1), whereas an intensive, short-pulse therapy delivered within a 2- to 4-month period was found to be highly efficacious in children with B-cell NHL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> (n = 114; relapse, n = 6; progression, n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e>) who were treated with similar alternating short courses of multi-agent chemotherapy had a less good outcome (n = 20; relapse, n = 6, progression, n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children with B-cell NHL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> who failed initial therapy also had a dismal prognosis (10/11 patients died) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Local radiotherapy as a part of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> therapy was completely abandoned in study NHL-BFM 90 and surgical interventions were confined to specific situations such as complete resection in localized B-cell NHL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e>, diagnostic biopsy and second-look operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results showed that the BFM treatment strategy for lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and B-cell NHL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> was highly successful in the majority of patients; however, optimal treatment for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> has not yet been defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, larger trials at an international level are necessary to find new prognostic markers that might define more precisely those patients who need further intensification of first-line treatment or novel therapy </plain></SENT>
