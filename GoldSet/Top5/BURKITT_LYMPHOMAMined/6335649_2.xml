<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two monoclonal antibodies directed at determinants on human B lymphocytes were produced and characterized by indirect immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antibodies, BL13 and BL14, were found to be specific for B cells, since they did not react on red cells, platelets, granulocytes, monocytes or T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BL14-associated antigen was present on most of the circulating and tissular B cells, whereas that detected by BL13 was mainly restricted to a subpopulation preferentially homed in germinal centers of secondary follicles of lymph nodes and tonsils, which did not circulate under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions and disappeared once B cells were activated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that BL13 precipitated an antigen of approximately 160,000 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathological studies confirmed the specificity of BL13 and BL14 antibodies for B lymphocytes, since they never reacted with non-B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BL14 bound to nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> malignant B-cell proliferations except very immature and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, BL13 was always found to be negative on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath>, prolymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath>, hairy cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> and plasma cells, whereas it detected 40-50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> and Burkitt or non-Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results led us to hypothesize several compartments for B-lymphocyte differentiation, either in central (bone marrow) or peripheral lymphoid organs, with BL13 antibody defining one compartment in the germinal centers </plain></SENT>
