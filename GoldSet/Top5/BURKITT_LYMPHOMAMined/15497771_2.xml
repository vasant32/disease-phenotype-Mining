<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we reviewed 97 bone marrow biopsies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients performed between 1998 and 2000 in the Em√≠lio Ribas Institute of Infectology, which is the reference department for HIV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specific diagnoses were performed in 33 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fungi were observed in eight cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of them were Histoplasma capsulatum, two were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010414" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cryptococcus neoformans</z:e>, and one probably Candida albicans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Acid-fast bacilli were observed in 12 bone marrow biopsies, three of which were diagnosed to have no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026918" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mycobacteriosis</z:e> clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Foci of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> with clusters of macrophages without any well-formed granuloma were observed in nine cases and well-formed granuloma in three cases </plain></SENT>
