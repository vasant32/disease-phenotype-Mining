<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The MYC oncogene, which is commonly mutated/amplified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, represents an important regulator of cell growth because of its ability to induce both proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence links MYC to altered miRNA expression, thereby suggesting that MYC-regulated miRNAs might contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further analyze the impact of MYC-regulated miRNAs, we investigated a murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> model harboring the MYC transgene in a Tet-off system to control its expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microarray-based miRNA expression profiling revealed both known and novel MYC targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the miRNAs repressed by MYC, we identified the potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor miR-26a, which possessed the ability to attenuate proliferation in MYC-dependent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, miR-26a was also found to be deregulated in primary human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples, thereby probably being of clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although today only few miRNA targets have been identified in human disease, we could show that ectopic expression of miR-26a influenced cell cycle progression by targeting the bona fide oncogene EZH2, a Polycomb protein and global regulator of gene expression yet unknown to be regulated by miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, in addition to directly targeting protein-coding genes, MYC modulates genes important to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> via deregulation of miRNAs, thereby vitally contributing to MYC-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
