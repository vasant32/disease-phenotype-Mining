<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two distinct entities of this disease have been recognized: endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (eBL), described in equatorial Africa, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (sBL), described in the USA and Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are striking differences in the incidence, epidemiology, clinical presentation and molecular characteristics of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells between the two forms, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> carry identical specific chromosomal translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have examined the position of the chromosomal breakpoints in the t (8;14) translocation, characteristic of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, relative to the c-myc oncogene in chromosome 8, and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus in chromosome 14 in samples obtained from four Argentine patients using the Southern blot technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> was digested with specific enzymes and hybridized with DNA probes from the c-myc (first and third exons) and IGH locus (C mu, S mu and JH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our analysis shows that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> carried the t (8;14) as shown by clonal rearrangements of c-myc in DNA treated with the enzymes Hind III and Eco RI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 tumours had chromosome 8 breakpoints within the Hind III restriction fragment that spans the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In case 1 it was between the Hind III and Pst I sites 5' to the first exon, in cases 2 and 4 between the Pvu II and Sma I sites 5' to the first exon and in case 3 within the first exon (Sma I-Pvu II segment).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
