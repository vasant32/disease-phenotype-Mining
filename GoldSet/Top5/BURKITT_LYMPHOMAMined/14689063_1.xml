<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively investigated the phenotype of blast cells from 44 adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> patients using a large panel of monoclonal antibodies by multiparametric flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients were classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> according to the FAB classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were diagnosed as ALL (10 cases <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, 1 case <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>) according to both FAB and immunnophenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated phenotypes in 28 of 33 AML patients (84.8%) and in 8 of 11 ALL patients (72.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 61.1% of patients more than one aberrant phenotype was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear infidelity was the most frequent aberrancy in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (64.3%) and ALL (37.5%) subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that MFC is a helpful method for sufficient identification of leukemic cells and for determination of blast cells immunophenotype <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The double stain flow cytometry in our study revealed aberrant phenotypes in up to 81.8% patients </plain></SENT>
