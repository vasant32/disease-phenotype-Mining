<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates whether phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), which has been reported to be intimately involved in the regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic cell growth, plays a role in CD40-promoted Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cell survival and uses the selective and reversible <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50914">PI3-kinase inhibitor</z:chebi>, LY294002 (LY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LY-mediated inhibition of PI3-kinase activity triggers growth inhibition and leads to the processing of caspase-3, caspase-3-like activity, cleavage of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> substrate poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> from the G1 phase of cell cycle </plain></SENT>
