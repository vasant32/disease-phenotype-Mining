<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanisms by which Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency III gene expression transforms primary B lymphocytes to lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), the associated alterations in cell gene expression were assessed by using 4,146 cellular cDNAs arrayed on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53325">nitrocellulose</z:chebi> filters and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,405 of the 4,146 cDNAs were detected using cDNA probes from poly(A)(+) <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of IB4 LCLs, a non-EBV-infected Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell line, BL41, or EBV latency III-converted BL41 cells (BL41EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> were consistently twofold more abundant in the IB4 LCL and BL41EBV than in BL41 by microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten of these are known to be EBV induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 23 of 28 newly identified EBV-induced genes were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, nine newly identified genes and CD10 were EBV repressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These EBV-regulated genes encode proteins involved in signal transduction, transcription, protein biosynthesis and degradation, and cell motility, shape, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven of seven newly identified EBV-induced <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> were more abundant in newly established LCLs than in resting B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surveys of eight promoters of newly identified genes implicate NF-kappaB or PU.1 as potentially important mediators of EBV-induced effects through LMP1 or EBNA2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, examination of the transcriptional effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> can elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which EBV latency III alters B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
