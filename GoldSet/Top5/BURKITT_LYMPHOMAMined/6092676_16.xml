<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>10-fold for latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation in neutral CsCl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The heavy-density DNA pool, which included more than 90% of the total intracellular EBV DNA sequences, was further fractionated by velocity sedimentation on neutral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> gradients, and material from fractions containing potential EBV DNA replicative forms was examined in the electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early in the cellular S phase, when the EBV DNA content was found to be doubling in parallel with host chromosome replication, half of the 50- to 55-micron circular EBV genomes were observed to have two or more DNA branch points or forks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most molecules were in a relaxed theta configuration, indicative of the Cairns mode of DNA replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the supercoiled state, the two daughter strands of the partially replicated molecules were seen to be wrapped around each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two theta structures had more than two DNA forks, indicating that DNA replication can initiate more than once on the same DNA molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late in the S phase, the EBV DNA sedimenting at positions where theta structures were found with early S phase samples was composed of catenated dimers rather than partially replicated genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the circular EBV genomes, which are the major intracellular form in latently infected cells, are maintained as independent replicons and are not synthesized from an integrated template </plain></SENT>
