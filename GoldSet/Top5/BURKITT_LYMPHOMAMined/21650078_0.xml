<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective study involving review of case notes of children suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Department of Paediatrics, University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> managed in the Department between January 1998 and December 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were histological or cytological confirmation of diagnosis, suggestive clinical features and availability of details about the course of the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Interval between diagnosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, rate of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days of diagnosis) and risk factors for early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty eight cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> were seen out of whom 52 died during the period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four cases with incomplete data were excluded from subsequent statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 29 (34.5%) early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The odds of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were increased in the presence of bilateral kidney involvement, masses in the liver, splenic masses, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastasis</z:e> and stage D of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastasis</z:e> was a significant independent predictor ofearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> mortality rate is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis and referral for appropriate care may reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> mortality in Nigeria </plain></SENT>
