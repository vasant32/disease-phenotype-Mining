<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Aberrant expression of the RON receptor tyrosine kinase is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to determine the role and functional mechanisms of RON in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and to document its potential as a therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: RON expression was determined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines by western blot analysis and examined in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimens by both western blotting and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation between RON expression and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Raji cells were treated with the Zt/f2 anti-RON mAb and cell viability, colony formation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell cycle arrest were measured in vitro using cell proliferation assays, colony-forming assays and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of RON by Zt/f2 was validated in mice bearing Raji cell xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: Immunohistostaining showed a high frequency of RON (+) cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> tissues and RON expression strongly correlated with EBV positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RON downregulation significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0000352'>decreased cell proliferation</z:mp> and colony formation via promotion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell cycle arrest in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The in vivo study showed that RON knockdown inhibits the tumorigenic potential of Raji cells in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: RON acts as an oncogene in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and is therefore a potential target for therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
