<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The enzyme induction caused by exposure of Raji cells to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-SB was the result of the synthesis of virus-specified <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, and the increase of linear EBV DNA content in Raji cells caused by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> alone was not sufficient for induction of EBV-enzyme activities </plain></SENT>
