<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The resistant phenotype was unstable and was maintained by weekly treatment of the cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Growing the resistant cells in the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> resulted in a time-dependent decrease in both resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> and topoisomerase II activity and an increase in DNA interstrand crosslinking induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> resistance is due to enhanced monoadduct repair with resultant decreased DNA crosslinking and that this process is mediated by topoisomerase II </plain></SENT>
