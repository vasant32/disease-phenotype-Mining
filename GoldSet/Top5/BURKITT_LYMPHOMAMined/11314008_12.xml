<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Homologues for human p53 (Hsp53) and p73 (Hsp73) genes were cloned and expression patterns for their corresponding proteins analysed in tissues from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and leukemic softshell clams (Mya arenaria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These are the first structural and functional data for p53 and p73 cDNAs and gene products in a naturally occurring, non-mammalian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684309" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">disease model</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Core sequence of the predicted clam p53 (Map53) and p73 (Map73) proteins is virtually identical and includes the following highly conserved regions: the transcriptional activation domain (TAD), MDM2 binding site, ATM phosphorylation site, proline rich domain, DNA binding domains (DBDs) II-V, nuclear import and export signals and the tetramerization domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The core sequence is a structural mosaic of the corresponding human proteins, with the TAD and DBDs resembling Hsp53 and Hsp73, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that Map53 and Map73 proteins may function similarly to human proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clam proteins have either a short (Map53) or long (Map73) C-terminal extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These features suggest that Map53 and Map73 may be alternate splice variants of a p63/p73-like ancestral gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Map73 is significantly upregulated in hemocytes and adductor muscle from leukemic clams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In leukemic hemocytes, both proteins are absent from the nucleus and sequestered in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that a non-mutational p53/p73-dependent mechanism may be involved in the clam disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies of these gene products in clams may reveal p53/p73-related molecular mechanisms that are held in common with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or other human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
