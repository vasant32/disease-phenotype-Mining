<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is even more uncommon for this nonendemic form of the disease to present in the head and neck region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, nonendemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has not been previously reported arising from the parapharyngeal space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We review the case of a 10-year-old boy who presented with an asymptomatic mass at the angle of the mandible several weeks after blunt trauma to that area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We discuss the evaluation of this mass, including the results of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, along with the findings of histopathologic and cytogenetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also discuss the differential diagnosis of parapharyngeal lesions, paying particular attention to the workup and management of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has the highest growth rate of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in man, rapid diagnosis and immediate treatment are important and likely to improve outcome </plain></SENT>
