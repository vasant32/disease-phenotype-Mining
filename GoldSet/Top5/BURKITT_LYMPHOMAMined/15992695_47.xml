<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous epidemiological studies of the relation between alcohol consumption and risk of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) have been inconsistent, probably because of small sample sizes of individual studies that result from stratification by NHL subtype and type of alcoholic beverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the role of alcohol consumption in NHL with sufficient sample size to analyse by both type of alcoholic beverage and disease subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We obtained original data from nine case-control studies from the USA, UK, Sweden, and Italy in the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph), yielding a pooled study population of 15 175 individuals (6492 cases and 8683 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We derived odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI from unconditional logistic regression models, controlling for study centre and other confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> between studies was assessed by comparison of results from joint fixed-effects logistic regression and two-stage random-effects logistic regression, and by calculation of Wald chi(2) statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: People who drank alcohol had a lower risk of NHL than did non-drinkers (OR 0.83 [95% CI 0.76-0.89]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with non-drinkers, risk estimates were lower for current drinkers than for former drinkers (0.73 [0.64-0.84] vs 0.95 [0.80-1.14]), but risk did not decrease with increasing alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of alcohol did not vary by beverage type, but did change with NHL subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lowest risk estimates were recorded for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (0.51 [0.33-0.77]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: People who drink alcoholic beverages might have a lower risk of NHL than those who do not, and this risk might vary by NHL subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further study designs are needed to determine whether confounding lifestyle factors or immunomodulatory effects of alcohol explain this association </plain></SENT>
