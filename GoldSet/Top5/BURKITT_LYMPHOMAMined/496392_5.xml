<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One mouse line tested, PG 19, had strong activity, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other rodent lines tested did not express CK BB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human and mouse CK BB can be expressed independently of each other in human--rodent somatic cell hybrids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is some evidence that the structural locus for CK BB may be on chromosome 14, but the involvement of other chromosomes, expecially no.17, cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MM and MB isozymes of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase were not seen in any human cultured cells </plain></SENT>
