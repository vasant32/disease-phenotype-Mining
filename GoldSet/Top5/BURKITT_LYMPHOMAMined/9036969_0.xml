<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the expression of CD23 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in several cell contexts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In EBV-infected Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, we have confirmed that high levels of expression are determined largely at the level of gene transcription by performing nuclear run-on transcription analyses and stability determinations of CD23 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> chase experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an effort to define the complexity of the potential modes of activation of CD23 in various cell contexts, we have studied the chromatin structure of the gene as determined by the pattern and distribution of DNasel hypersensitive sites in CD23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have found that, unlike the results obtained in many analogous systems, there is no distinct pattern of hypersensitive sites that uniquely correlates with high levels of CD23 transcription in various B lineage cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instead, we found a complex pattern that suggests that CD23 expression is regulated by trans-acting regulatory factors whose activity is dependent upon the stage of cellular differentiation as well as the cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By determining whether the DNA encompassing these hypersensitive sites contains transcriptional enhancer activity, we discovered a novel enhancer that functions in an EBV-dependent fashion and encompasses a 384-bp segment that lies 3.7 kb upstream from the transcription start site </plain></SENT>
