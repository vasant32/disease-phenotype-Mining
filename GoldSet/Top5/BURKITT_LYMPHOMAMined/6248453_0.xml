<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, growth characteristics, tumorigenicity, expression of Epstein-Barr virus antigens and surface membrane immunoglobulins (SmIg) of the four lymphoid cell lines confirmed the correct identifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In determining the possibility of cross contamination, the most reliable criteria for the identification of lymphoid cell lines were found to be HLA antigenic profile, karyotype, cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and growth characteristics </plain></SENT>
