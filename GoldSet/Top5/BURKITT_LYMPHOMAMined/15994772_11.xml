<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CBF1 is a cellular highly conserved DNA binding factor that is ubiquitously expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissues and acts as a repressor of cellular genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Epstein-Barr virus growth-transformed B-cell lines, CBF1 serves as a central DNA adaptor molecule for several <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> proteins, including the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> transactivator Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBNA-2 binds to CBF1 and thereby gains access to regulatory regions of target genes and activates transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have inactivated the CBF1 gene by homologous recombination in the human B-cell line DG75 and characterized changes in cellular gene expression patterns upon loss of CBF1 and activation of EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CBF1-negative DG75 cells were viable and proliferated at <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Loss of CBF1 was not sufficient to release repression of the previously described EBNA-2 target genes CD21 or CCR7, whereas induction of both target genes by EBNA-2 required CBF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, repression of immunoglobulin M by EBNA-2 was mainly CBF1 independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CBF1-negative DG75 B cells thus provide an excellent tool to dissect CBF1-dependent and -independent functions exerted by the EBNA-2 protein in future studies </plain></SENT>
