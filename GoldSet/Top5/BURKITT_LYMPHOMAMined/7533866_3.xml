<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to investigate the role of cytokines (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF alpha), interferon gamma (IFN gamma) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) in augmenting graft-versus-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (GVL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the effector cells involved in GVL, by studying the role of these cells in purging of the cell line K562 in short-term bone marrow cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of the addition in vitro of rGCSF was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of purging was achieved by cytotoxicity assays, DNA analysis and the use of the polymerase chain reaction for the detection of bcr/abl transcripts in the Philadelphia positive (Ph+) K562 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Supernatants from IL-2-treated and non-treated bone marrow were tested for cytokine production (TNF alpha and IFN gamma) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results have shown that the main cytotoxic effector cells in the bone marrow generated by IL-2 have the CD56+ CD8+ phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overnight incubation of bone marrow was sufficient to generate cytotoxic cells as measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">Chromium51</z:chebi> (Cr51) release assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measurable levels of TNF alpha but not IFN gamma were also detected in supernatants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Addition of TNF alpha and IFN gamma to the IL-2 in the bone marrow cultures augmented the cytotoxicity but tended to inhibit progenitor cell growth as measured by granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (GM-CFU) and erythroid blast-forming unit (BFU-e) assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An estimate of the purging of the marrow could also be achieved by DNA analysis of K562 DNA in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The bcr/abl transcript could still be detected by PCR analysis in marrow containing 1% K562 and treated with IL-2 for 24 h, but by 6 days of incubation the bcr/abl transcript was weak or undectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that although reduction in the proportion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in contaminated marrow can be detected after incubation with IL-2 for 24 h, complete elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> requires longer incubation times </plain></SENT>
