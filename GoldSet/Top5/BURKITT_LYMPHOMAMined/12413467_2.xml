<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An add-in to Microsoft Excel was developed to simulate multiple binding equilibriums </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A partition function, readily written even when the equilibrium is complex, describes the experimental system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It involves the concentrations of the different free molecular species and of the different complexes present in the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, the software is not restricted to a series of predefined experimental setups but can handle a large variety of problems involving up to nine independent molecular species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Binding parameters are estimated by nonlinear least-square fitting of experimental measurements as supplied by the user </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fitting process allows user-defined weighting of the experimental data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The flexibility of the software and the way it may be used to describe common experimental situations and to deal with usual problems such as tracer reactivity or nonspecific binding is demonstrated by a few examples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The software is available free of charge upon request </plain></SENT>
