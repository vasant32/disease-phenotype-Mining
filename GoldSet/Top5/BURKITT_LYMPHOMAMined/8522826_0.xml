<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maximum concentrations of the EBV-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA) before cellular DNA synthesis were similar to those of healthy counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, EBV-immortalised cell lines were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These immortalised lymphoblastoid cells were treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) and superinfected with the P3HR-1 strain of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBV early antigens (EA) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (VCA) were expressed in approximately 3-10 fold higher concentrations by these lymphoblastoid cells than by those from patients with other types of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> including EBV genome-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and from healthy counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moderate to extremely high IgG antibody titres to EBV VCA as well as IgG antibodies to EA were demonstrated in these patients during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that defective underlying cellular mechanisms for regulating the replication of EBV may be present in patients with EBV genome-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
