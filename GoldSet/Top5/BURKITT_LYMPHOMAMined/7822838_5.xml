<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Receptor-specific binding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> is followed by internalization of the bound complex and lysosomal hydrolysis of the ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increase in the fluorescence intensity per cell is hence used as a measure of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> uptake and, implicitly, as an indication of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-R presence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show that uptake was observed in &gt; 98% of the Daudi cells, and the level of uptake was significant and clearly distinguishable from autofluorescence, suggesting that: (a) this assay is comparable to the iodinated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> uptake assay, although the ED50 values for the ligands are different; (b) this assay is comparable to the flow-cytometric detection of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-R using a commercial antibody directed against the receptor itself, and superior to a similar assay based on an antibody directed against membrane-bound <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>; (c) <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> uptake could be monitored along with transferrin uptake, suggesting that multiple endocytic receptor activities can be concurrently studied; (d) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> uptake can be examined along with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-conjugated anti-CD10, -CD19, and -CD71, with little cross-interference, offering the added advantage that endocytic uptake and phenotyping can be simultaneously monitored; (e) the expression of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-R is intrinsically elevated in diverse cell lines such as Daudi, Raji, Ramos, Jurkat, and WIL2-NS, but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results therefore indicate that flow cytometric analysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> uptake has potentially useful applications in the detection and study of endocytic receptor <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-R in B and T lymphocytic cell lines </plain></SENT>
