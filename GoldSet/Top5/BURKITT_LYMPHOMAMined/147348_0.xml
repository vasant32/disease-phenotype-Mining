<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The stimulatory capacity of these two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines was approximately equal to that of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that not only <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> B-cells but also <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> null cells have stimulatory determinants in mixed lymphocyte culture </plain></SENT>
