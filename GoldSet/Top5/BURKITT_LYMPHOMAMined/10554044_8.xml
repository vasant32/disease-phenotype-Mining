<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have used YAC (yeast artificial chromosome) technology to create large translocation regions where the c-myc proto-oncogene is coupled to the core region of the human immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus (from VH2-5 through to Cdelta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chimeric mice were obtained from embryonic stem cells carrying a single copy of the 240-kb IgH/c-myc translocation region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>B-cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> occurs in the translocus mice, even when the entire Emu intron enhancer region between the joining segments and switch mu is deleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates that as yet unidentified regulatory elements in the IgH locus, independent from the known enhancers, are sufficient to cause B-cell specific activation of c-myc after translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from IgH/c-myc YAC transgenic mice with or without Emu (B220+, IgM+/IgD+) is reminiscent of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A rapidly expanding abnormal B-cell population is present at birth and accumulates in bone marrow, periphery, and spleen, well before discrete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> establishment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis identified a clonal origin, with rearrangement of one mouse heavy chain allele retained in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from different sites, whereas subsequent rearrangements of heavy or light chain loci can be diverse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These mice routinely develop mature B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> early in life and may provide an invaluable resource of a B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
