<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>1966.-Indirect immunofluorescence tests led to the brilliant staining of a small proportion of the cells in five different cultures derived from Burkitt's (African) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reaction was not restricted to the 17 sera from cases of this disease but extended to many sera from American individuals, whether healthy donors or patients suffering from a variety of illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of positive sera increased with age from about 30% in childhood to &gt; 90% in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">Fluorescein-isothiocyanate</z:chebi>-conjugated human gamma-globulins were suitable for direct staining of the same proportion of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The stained cells appeared to be in varying stages of degeneration, but cultural conditions leading to an increase in the cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates failed to result in a rise in fluorescent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Several observations suggest that the stainable cells might be those which are seen to harbor virus particles under the electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two cell lines derived from leukemic patients in this country also contained a small fraction of stainable cells but two others, and numerous primary human leukocyte cultures, gave consistently negative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Attempts to relate the staining to known <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigens have failed to implicate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e>, varicella, cytomegalo, and reo viruses types 1, 2, and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The nature of the virus carried by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells as well as of the staining reactions remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
