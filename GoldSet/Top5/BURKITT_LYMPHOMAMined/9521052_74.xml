<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since EBNA1 is not recognized by EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), there is increasing interest in the identification of the potential target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> within LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although LMP1-specific CTL have been isolated from seropositive individuals, earlier attempts to identify the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> recognized by these T cells have been unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present report we used a novel protocol to identify CTL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> within LMP1 which can be recognized by both polyclonal and clonal CTL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Firstly, a computer-based program was employed to identify the potential HLA-binding <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> within LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polyclonal CD8+ CTL were then isolated from seropositive donors that recognized the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> YLLEMLWRL and YLQQNWWTL from LMP1 in association with HLA A2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Limiting dilution analysis of the memory CTL response revealed that the LMP1-specific CTL response constitutes a minor component of the CTL response in healthy virus carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, analysis of YLLEMLWRL-specific CTL revealed that these CTL were able to lyse EBV-infected B cells expressing different HLA A2 supertype alleles including A*0201, A*0202, A*0203, A*0204, A*0206, A*6802 and A*6901 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data strongly support the notion that HLA class I supertype-restricted CTL may be of significant use in the development of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-based immunotherapeutics against EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in different ethnic populations </plain></SENT>
