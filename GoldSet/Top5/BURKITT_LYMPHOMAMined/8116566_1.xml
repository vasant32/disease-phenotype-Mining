<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients with ALL-L3 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> restricted to the marrow and blood with no evidence of an extramedullary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> at their initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients with stage IV SNCL had evidence of extramedullary disease in addition to marrow and blood involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with marrow and blood involvement by SNCL at the time of a first or second relapse were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age of the ALL-L3 patients was 33.5 years, compared with 13 years for the patients with stage IV SNCL and 10.5 years for the marrow relapse patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the ALL-L3 patients wre male; the male:female ratio for the SNCL patients was 17:2; for the relapse group, 9:5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of the ALL-L3 patients had symptoms related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo>; the majority of the SNCL patients had symptoms related to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laboratory values at the time of initial diagnosis were similar for the ALL-L3 and SNCL patients, except that the median platelet count was lower in the ALL-L3 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite extensive marrow involvement by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in most patients, frankly leukemic blood pictures were uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Light-chain-restricted surface immunoglobulin on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells was a consistent finding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases tested; the findings were similar in the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic data, available for 19 cases, showed no difference between cases with and without extramedullary disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 5.1 months for ALL-L3 patients and 3.2 months for SNCL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median survival from the time of bone marrow relapse was 2.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that ALL-L3 and SNCL represent different manifestations of the same disease process </plain></SENT>
