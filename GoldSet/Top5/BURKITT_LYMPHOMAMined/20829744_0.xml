<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cultured human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (Raji B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line) were allocated into five study groups in Roswell Park Memorial Institute media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using manual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, cells were then processed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> alone, by 20-G vitrectomy at 600 cuts per minute (cpm) and 1,500 cpm, or by 25-G vitrectomy at both 600 and 1,500 cpm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess cell viability and cell surface marker expression, samples underwent standard flow cytometry analysis for suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> using 7-amino-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> and antibodies against CD45, CD19, lambda, and kappa light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five samples were processed after being divided into four vitrectomy groups and one nonvitrectomy group (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean cell viability was 98.5 for both the nonvitrectomized and vitrectomized specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of cells positive for CD45 or kappa light chain was the same in the nonvitrectomized and vitrectomized groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the level of expression of these molecules was not significantly different in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no difference was seen for these markers between 20-G and 25-G vitrectomy at either a cut rate of 600 or 1,500 cpm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentage positive for CD19 was significantly lower for the 20-G vitrectomy at 1,500 cpm compared with the 25-G vitrectomy at both 600 and 1,500 cpm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Percentage of CD19 cells was greater for the 25-G vitrectomy at 600 cpm than the nonvitrectomy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared with simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, both 20-G and 25-G vitrectomy seem to have no significant effect on cell viability or diagnostic yield for B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (Raji cell line) in suspension based on flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies need to be conducted to study and compare 20-G versus 25-G vitrectomy on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in human vitreous or in an animal model </plain></SENT>
