<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> resemble lymphocytes at distinct differentiation stages and show characteristic morphologic, genetic, and transcriptional features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have performed a microarray-based DNA methylation profiling of 83 mature aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (maB-NHLs) characterized for their morphologic, genetic, and transcriptional features, including molecular Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hierarchic clustering indicated that methylation patterns in maB-NHLs were not strictly associated with morphologic, genetic, or transcriptional features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By supervised analyses, we identified 56 genes de novo methylated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes studied and 22 methylated in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtype-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, the group of genes de novo methylated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes was significantly enriched for polycomb targets in embryonic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>De novo methylated genes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> maB-NHLs studied were expressed at low levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic tissues but not in nonhematopoietic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings, especially the enrichment for polycomb targets in stem cells, indicate that maB-NHLs with different morphologic, genetic, and transcriptional background share a similar stem cell-like epigenetic pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that maB-NHLs originate from cells with stem cell features or that stemness was acquired during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> by epigenetic remodeling </plain></SENT>
