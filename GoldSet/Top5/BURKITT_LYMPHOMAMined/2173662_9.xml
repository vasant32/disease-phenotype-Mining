<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a first step towards the identification of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene product responsible for this change we have studied the influence of the EBV latent membrane protein (LMP) on the stimulatory capacity of the EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines BL41 and DG75 and the B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line BJAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four LMP-transfected sublines of BL41, four DG75 LMP transfectants and one LMP-transfected subline of BJAB showed a significantly stronger stimulatory capacity than the original line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect was directly proportional to the amount of LMP detected in each transfectant but was not due to reactivation of LMP-specific memory cells since lymphocytes from EBV-seropositive and -seronegative individuals responded equally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In order to define the relation between LMP expression and induction of stimulatory capacity, DG75 was transfected with constructs containing the LMP gene under the control of an heat-shock promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The peak of LMP expression in heat shock-treated cells preceded the appearance of stimulatory capacity by 6-12 h suggesting that critical amounts of the protein may be required to induce the phenotypic change recognized by the T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LMP influenced in a dose-dependent manner the expression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules LFA-1, LFA-3 and ICAM-1 and B cell activation markers CD23 and CD39 in transfected sublines of BL41, but did not affect the expression of these markers in the DG75 and BJAB cell line </plain></SENT>
