<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The mechanisms responsible for resistant disease or recurrence of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in children cover a wide spectrum from drug resistance to genetic mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A unique mechanism suggesting the role of mitochondria as the key energy source is studied following a clinical observation where pediatric Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) specimens from patients on therapy were found to have increased copies of mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) in specimens which were shown to be positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> and/or persistent disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study hypothesized that the mitochondria play an important role in a cell's recovery from toxicity via a compensatory increase in mtDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> specimens with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> were assayed for mtDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An in vitro model was then designed using Ramos cell lines by exposing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to varying concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> for 1 hr; and allowing for recovery in culture over 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from aliquots over several days to determine mtDNA copy numbers by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased mtDNA copy numbers were found in clinical specimens with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> as well as in recovering Ramos cells from chemotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The recovering <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells from the chemotoxic effects appeared to compensate by increasing mtDNA content, which may contribute to the clinical residual or resistant disease in some cases of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
