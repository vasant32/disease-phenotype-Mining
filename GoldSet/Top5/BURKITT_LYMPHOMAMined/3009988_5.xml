<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Four antiglucocorticoids, RU38486, RU5020, RU25055 and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> were found to antagonize the induction of latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) information by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dose response studies show that the antagonization was more prominent with the synthetic steroids than with the natural hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specific binding characteristics of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> measured in whole cells indicate the presence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total cellular receptor contents deduced from binding data give values similar to those reported for B-lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Competition experiments between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> and RU38436 strongly suggest that RU38486 binds to two distinct sites in the whole cell; one is the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor but the nature of the other site is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition by antiglucocorticoids differs from antagonism by 12-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="45127">phorbol-13-acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) since the latter does not compete for any sites interacting with RU38486 </plain></SENT>
