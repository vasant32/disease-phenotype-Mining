<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with zinc, which acts as an inhibitor of proteolytic cleavage, prevented interferon production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When cytoskeletal function was disrupted by adding both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">cytochalasin</z:chebi> B to the induced Namalwa cells, secretion of interferon was inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that after translation of the interferon <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, the newly synthesized interferon <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> is discharged into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, and undergoes a proteolytic cleavage before it is secreted by a process involving the cytoskeleton </plain></SENT>
