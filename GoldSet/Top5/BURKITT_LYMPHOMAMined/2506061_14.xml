<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are no such sequences in the mu-delta introns of human and mouse genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the frequency of IgD-secreting cells is extremely low in mouse about 1% of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> produce IgD in human </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a previous report (Nucleic Acids Res </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>16: 9497) we reported that a 442-bp DNA sequence located in the JH-mu intron (defined as sigma mu) was inserted into the mu-delta intron (defined as sigma mu) in human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is no such insertion in mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We analyzed Ig H chain gene loci of two human IgD <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myelomas</z:mp>: one was analyzed by cloning and sequencing and the other by Southern hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that recombination had occurred between these two homologous DNA sequences, resulting in loss of the DNA segment from sigma mu to sigma mu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Daudi, the DNA fragment from sigma mu to sigma mu was duplicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that homologous recombination between sigma mu and sigma mu sequences mediates class switch from mu to delta in human and that it occurs via unequal crossing-over between sister chromatids or daughter chromosomes </plain></SENT>
