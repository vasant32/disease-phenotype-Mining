<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In eight (40 per cent) of them these inclusions could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the morphogenesis and significance of these ITI are not clearly understood, they have been found in several autoimmune and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> diseases, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e>, a disease caused by EBV, and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which is closely associated with EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence, the presence of ITI in NPC, another disease associated with EBV, seems to be of some significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that these inclusions could be the result of an immunological reaction initiated by injured cells infected with EBV, which acted as an antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of another type of cytoplasmic inclusion, hitherto unknown, has also been reported </plain></SENT>
