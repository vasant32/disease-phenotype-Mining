<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major characteristic reported here is retention of activity on exposure to specific physical or chemical conditions followed by loss of activity after subsequent neutral dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antigen of untreated cell lysates, which retains activity after dialysis against large volumes of neutral buffers or 0.14 M <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>, will lose activity if the lysate is first heated to 56 degrees or if the lysate is exposed to acid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49706">perchlorate</z:chebi>, and the resulting precipitate and supernatant are redialyzed separately to neutral pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The P3HR-1 soluble complement-fixing antigen appears to be an aggregate including a labile, dissociable component </plain></SENT>
