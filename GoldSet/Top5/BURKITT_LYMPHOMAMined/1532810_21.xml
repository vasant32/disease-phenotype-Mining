<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our experiments show that some gamma/delta T cells coexpressing V gamma 9 and V delta 1 genes also react to Daudi cells in cytotoxic and proliferative assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of V gamma 9 is not sufficient for the recognition of Daudi cells because most gamma/delta T cells expressing V delta 1 paired with V gamma 9 or other V gamma genes neither kill Daudi cells nor proliferate to Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>V gamma 9/V delta 2 T cells do not proliferate to other cell lines such as K562 or Molt4 that are sensitive to MHC-unrestricted cytolysis by NK cells and by most IL-2-activated gamma/delta T cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cold target inhibition assays demonstrate that Daudi cells are stronger inhibitors than K562 and Molt4 of MHC-unrestricted lysis by V gamma 9/V delta 2 clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, cold Daudi cells are relatively weaker inhibitors of MHC-unrestricted lysis by NK cell clones, most gamma/delta T cell clones expressing V delta 1 and alpha/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36018">beta T</z:chebi> cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, recognition by V gamma 9/V delta 2 T cells and certain V gamma 9/V delta 1 T cells of Daudi appears to involve a specific triggering pathway that is distinct from recognition by these gamma/delta T cells of Molt4, K562, and other target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NK cell clones and most other gamma/delta and alpha/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36018">beta T</z:chebi> cell clones derived from the same <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteer blood donors do not show this specific interaction with Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data show that distinct subsets of human gamma/delta T cells recognize Daudi cells and support the idea that the gamma/delta TCR may be directly involved </plain></SENT>
