<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of Gb3/CD77 synthase together with Gb3/CD77 antigen were analyzed using human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumor</z:e> cell lines and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among about 40 kinds of cells, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells showed the highest gene expression concomitant with the expression levels of Gb3/CD77 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, megakaryoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> lines also expressed fairly high levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of Gb3/CD77 synthase and its product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A megakaryoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> line, MEG-01 was sensitive to verotoxins from Escherichia coli O157 and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was induced via the caspase pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that the cell surface Gb3/CD77 expression was reduced on differentiated MEG-01 although the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of the alpha1,4Gal-T gene increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this case, the localization of Gb3/CD77 was changed from the cell surface to the cytoplasm as stained with a granular pattern, co-localizing with platelet GPIIb-IIIa, indicating that some of them were platelet precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small particles outside of cells also showed similar staining patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results agreed with the previous report that platelets produced in mature megakaryoblasts abundantly contained Gb3/CD77 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here, we propose the possibility that verotoxins bind immature megakaryoblasts and induce their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, leading to the arrest of platelet generation in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may be one of the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005575'>hemolytic uremic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
