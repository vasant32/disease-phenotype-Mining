<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate a differential platelet in vitro proaggregating activity in three Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>--derived human B cell lines, i.e. Daudi, Raji and P3H-R1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Functional and ultrastructural findings indicated the ability of Daudi cells to induce a marked secondary irreversible platelet aggregation, while the Raji cells only induced a primary-type reversible platelet response; no evidence of proaggregating activity has been obtained for P3H-R1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Luminometric assays indicated that contact of Daudi and Raji, but not P3H-R1, cells with platelet rich plasma (PRP) or platelet poor plasma (PPP) was followed by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> release, in the range of 2,2-3,5 microM and 0.4-0.6 microM respectively for Daudi and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After preincubation of PRP with apyrase Daudi cells induced a reversible platelet response similar to that obtained with the use of Raji cells: then, the irreversible complete platelet response induced by Daudi cells was to be related to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> release from degranulating platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiments in gel-filtered platelet systems showed that the plasma co-factor inducing <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> release from Daudi and Raji cells was not fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specific inhibition of platelet thrombin receptors, as well as of cycloxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, did not modify the proaggregating activity of Daudi and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Work is in progress to characterize the plasma factor interacting with Daudi and Raji, but not P3H-R1 cells, and the differences between the three cell lines which support this differential interaction </plain></SENT>
