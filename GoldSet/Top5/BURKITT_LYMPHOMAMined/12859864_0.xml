<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish a flow cytometric method for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> and evaluate its clinical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-eight childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cases entered this study and 30 MRD analyses were performed after remission induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four-color <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51217">fluorochrome</z:chebi> labeled monoclonal antibodies were used to analyze the cell immunophenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The leukemic cell populations located in flow cytometry dot plots different from those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> were considered to be the markers of interest in the first step screening, and then used to monitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> step after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-eight cases of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> were screened for antibodies combinations of interest and were identified in 89.7% (52/58) of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The four-color antibody combinations consisted of CD(10)/CD(34)/CD(19) plus another effective marker such as CD(38), CD(65), CD(66c), CD(21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of this method was 0.01%, much higher than microscopic inspection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 8 cases whose bone marrow microscopically showed no residual leukemic cells, the percentage of leukemic cells were identified with this method of 0.028%, 1.430%, 3.050%, 0.015%, 5.660%, 2.700%, 0.027%, and 0.069%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The application of flow cytometry in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> monitoring can significantly improve the detection sensitivity in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, thus facilitate the further treatment decision and follow-up </plain></SENT>
