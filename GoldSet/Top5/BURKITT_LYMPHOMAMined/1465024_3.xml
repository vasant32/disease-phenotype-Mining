<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In adults, it is often encountered in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of 9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> leukemic cell lines with 11q23 translocations and one with deletion of the 11q23 locus, nine of which were established by researchers in this group, together with 4 NHL cell lines with 11q23 translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lines were considered to belong to the B-cell lineage at different stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 leukemic lines showed clonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene: two corresponded to the B-precursor stage (CD19+, cytoplasmic mu-), while the other 8 corresponded to the pre-B stage (cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30214">mu+</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 NHL lines showed rearrangements of both the IgH and Ig kappa genes with three expressing surface Ig; specifically, mature B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As for myelocytic-monocytic markers, at least one out of 4 antigens examined were positive in 8 of the 10 leukemic cell lines, while only one of the 4 NHL lines was reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were essentially no clear phenotypic or genotypic differences between t(4;11) and t(11;19) cell lines, supporting the view that both diseases have similar clinicopathological characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These cell lines are also valuable for cloning genes at the chromosomal breakpoints </plain></SENT>
