<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High anti-VCA titers are associated with EBV-related lymphoproliferation, such as Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intrafamilial correlations of anti-VCA IgG levels were studied in 3 settings: 127 families recruited through patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> in France (population A), 31 families recruited through patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in Uganda (population B), and 74 large families from a general population in Cameroon (population C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (populations A and C) or by immunofluorescence analysis (population B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In populations A and B, the anti-VCA IgG titers of the relatives of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> increased significantly (P = .01 and P &lt; .001, respectively) with those of the index case patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 populations, anti-VCA IgG titers were significantly correlated (P &lt; .001 for A, P = .002 for B, and P &lt; .001 for C) between genetically related individuals (father-offspring, mother-offspring, and sibling-sibling) but not between spouses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained for population A after adjustment for total IgG levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the pattern of correlations was consistent with a polygenic model, with heritability ranging from 0.32 to 0.48 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence for the genetic control of anti-VCA IgG titers and pave the way for identification of the loci involved </plain></SENT>
