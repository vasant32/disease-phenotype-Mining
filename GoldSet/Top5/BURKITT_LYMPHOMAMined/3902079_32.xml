<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A DNA glycosylase which catalyzes the release of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi> residues damaged by ring saturation, fragmentation, or ring contraction from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> has been used to characterize such base derivatives in gamma-irradiated DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is shown by chromatographic analysis that irradiation of DNA in neutral solution generates the ring-saturated forms cis-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29128">thymine glycol</z:chebi>, trans-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29128">thymine glycol</z:chebi>, and a monohydroxydihydrothymine, probably 6-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter compound is only observed after irradiation under hypoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ring-contracted <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi> derivative 5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantoin is also formed, and it is the major lesion after irradiation of DNA under O2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ring-fragmented products such as methyltartronylurea were only generated in small quantities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Isolation and analysis of the DNA from gamma-irradiated human cells also revealed the formation of ring-saturated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi> derivatives, but 5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantoin was not found in this case </plain></SENT>
