<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The chimeric anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (Rituxan, IDEC-C2B8) is widely used in the clinical treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rituximab sensitizes NHL B-cell lines to drug-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> via down-regulation of Bcl-x(L) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the mechanism by which rituximab down-regulates Bcl-x(L) may be, in part, due to inhibition of constitutive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity that regulates Bcl-x(L) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was tested in CD20(+) drug-resistant Ramos (Bcl-2(-)/Bcl-x(L)(+)) and Daudi (Bcl-2(+)/Bcl-x(L)(+)) cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rituximab decreased the phosphorylation of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase, IkappaB kinase, and IkappaB-alpha, diminished IKK kinase activity, and decreased NF-kappaB DNA binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These events occurred with similar kinetics and were observed 3 to 6 hours post-rituximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rituximab significantly up-regulated Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein expression, thus interrupting the NF-kappaB signaling pathway concomitant with Bcl-x(L) and Bfl-1/A1 down-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The role of NF-kappaB in the regulation of Bcl-x(L) transcription was shown using promoter reporter assays in which deletion of the two-tandem NF-kappaB binding sites in the upstream promoter region significantly reduced the luciferase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was further corroborated by using IkappaB superrepressor cells and by NF-kappaB-specific inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The direct role of Bcl-x(L) in drug resistance was assessed by using Bcl-x(L)-overexpressing cells, which exhibited higher drug resistance that was partially reversed by rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rituximab-mediated inhibition of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and chemosensitization was corroborated by the use of specific inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings reveal a novel pathway mediated by rituximab through Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein induction that negatively regulates the constitutive NF-kappaB pathway and chemosensitization of the NHL B-cells </plain></SENT>
