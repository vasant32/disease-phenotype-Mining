<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the last few years, serological identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-associated antigens (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi>) by recombinant cDNA expression cloning (SEREX) has enabled the mapping of humoral immune responses against <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi> in various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present paper describes the application of SEREX to Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> not previously characterized by SEREX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using a cDNA library from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line that does not express IgG, technical difficulties related to background immunoglobulin clones were overcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Screening with sera from three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients revealed immunoreactivity against seven different gene products, six of which represent known human genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five proteins had previously been characterized by SEREX in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> or identified as targets of autoantibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seroreactivity against ATF-2, a member of the AP-1 transcription factor family, was validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis using recombinant ATF-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autoantibody responses against ATF-2 were detected by ELISA in 6 of 8 BL patients, compared with 6 of 13 patients with T-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (T-NHL), 5 of 23 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 2 of 27 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, reactivity was found in only 1 of 50 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Next, we showed by immunohistochemistry that the activated form of ATF2 (ATF-2pp) was highly expressed in six different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the SEREX approach with a B-cell cDNA source is applicable in NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we identified genes with possible involvement in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> using this technique </plain></SENT>
