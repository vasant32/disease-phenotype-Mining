<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>T-cell receptor beta (TCR beta) gene rearrangements occur in a third of early B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (ALLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>V, D, and J segments involved in these inappropriate rearrangements remain unknown and are of interest, both because partial D beta J beta and complete V beta D beta J beta recombinations occur at distinct stages of thymic maturation and because these rearrangements are regulated differently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have therefore studied in detail seven cases of B-lineage ALL that show inappropriate clonal TCR beta gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of genomic DNA by Southern hybridization with C beta, J beta 1, V beta 8, and V beta 11 probes suggested the involvement of V beta segment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A complete genomic library constructed from one case was screened with a C beta probe, and the TCR beta gene rearrangement was cloned and fully sequenced to show an out of frame V beta 2.2-J beta 2.6 recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCR beta gene rearrangements occurring in other cases were further analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using J beta and V beta primers and the resulting specific PCR products were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence of clonal V beta rearrangements was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These unexpected findings represent the first definitive demonstration that complete V beta(D beta)J beta rearrangements can occur in B-lineage cells and contrast with the previously reported lack of V beta(D beta)J beta rearrangement in B cells from V beta-J beta-C beta-E mu transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the context of increasing evidence that rearrangements are linked to transcription of unrearranged gene segments, these data prompt a search in B-lineage ALL cells for the presence of germline V beta transcripts whose deregulated expression may be linked to early transforming events </plain></SENT>
