<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation for the non-thrombogenic effect of the endothelium is the presence of prostacyclin, (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>), the potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation and adherence, which is produced and released by the endothelium in response to various stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Removal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> from the endothelium did not increase baseline platelet adherence, but did increase thrombin-induced platelet adherence from 4 to 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additions of exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> at low concentrations reversed the enhanced thrombin-induced platelet adherence under these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although it is unlikely that prostacyclin is the sole factor regulating platelet adherence to the endothelium, it appears to play a major role in the interaction of platelets with components of the blood vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditions which predispose to adherence of platelets to the vessel wall may involve entrapment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whether prostacyclin and other factors involved in the non-thrombogenic character of the vascular endothelium provide a significant defense against attachment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells is not known, but the potential for such a primary or secondary role clearly exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our studies, prostacyclin did not appear to influence the adherence of Raji <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are indicated to correlate adherence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells to the vascular wall with their potential for formation of metastatic lesions </plain></SENT>
