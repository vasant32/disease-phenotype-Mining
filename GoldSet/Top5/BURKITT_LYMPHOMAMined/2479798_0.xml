<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A novel dye exclusion assay based on differential staining of fixed cells has been evaluated using the MOLT4 (T-lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>) and DAUDI (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reproducible differential staining was found with fixed samples kept for up to 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A small increase (less than 13%) in the proportion of stained cells was observed over the first 30 days in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50913">fixative</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reproducible dose-response data were obtained with cells treated with radiation or drugs and assayed after 4 days in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This ability to fix cells prior to measurement of viability is of general use particularly where time constraints prevent haemocytometer counting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More specifically, it may have potential use in the field of chemosensitivity testing particularly where large sample numbers require rapid processing </plain></SENT>
