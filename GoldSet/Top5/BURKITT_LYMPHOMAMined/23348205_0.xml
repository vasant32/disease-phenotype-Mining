<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data describing the DH cases are largely based on DH-BCL2/MYC cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To better characterize DH-BCL6/MYC cases, the clinical, morphologic, phenotypic, and cytogenetic features of 6 cases from University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and 17 cases from the Mitelman database were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center cases, the median age was 83 years (range, 51 to 89 y) with 5/6 DLBCL/BL cases and 1 large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, not otherwise specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of 6 had a germinal center phenotype, 1/6 was BCL2(+), and the median Ki-67 score was 98% (35% to 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Mitelman DH-BCL6/MYC cases included 13 aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>-5, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-5, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>-2, and primary effusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-1) and 4 other lymphoid/plasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median cytogenetic complexity score was 2.5 (range, 0 to 14) in 14 evaluable mature aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with an immunoglobulin gene partner for MYC in 9/14 and for BCL6 in 7/14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten of 13 cases involved extranodal extramedullary sites at presentation, and the median survival for the 10 patients with large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and with available follow-up data was 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, DH-BCL6/MYC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are aggressive, frequently involve extranodal sites, and are often <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> with a germinal center phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unlike DH-BCL2/MYC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, however, they are more likely to be CD10(-) but IRF4/MUM-1(+) (P=0.03) and, more like <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, only infrequently express BCL2 (P&lt;0.001), and are cytogenetically less complex (P&lt;0.04) </plain></SENT>
