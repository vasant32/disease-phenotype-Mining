<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new technique for the detection of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> antigens in immune complexes (IC) isolated from serum is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The technique was developed with a model IC system consisting of ovalbumin (OVA)-rabbit anti-ovalbumin antibodies (aOVA), at 3 times antigen excess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OVA-aOVA IC added to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human serum (NHS) were purified by absorption onto and elution from tubes coated with rheumatoid factor (RF) and were subjected to electrophoresis in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concanavalin A (Con A)-binding proteins were detected by treating the gels with radioiodinated Con A (125Con A), followed by autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IC isolated from sera of patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and Nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>Carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) were analyzed before and after reduction with dithiothreitol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two closely spaced proteins of about 40 kdalton were identified in the reduced samples in 26 of 30 BL sera (86%) and in 24 of 30 NPC sera (80%) but were not seen in 30 sera of African patients with a variety of unrelated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> nor in 12 sera of European blood bank donors </plain></SENT>
