<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we report our findings on the impact of p53 disruption on the sensitivity of human cell lines to the antimitotic agents <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">Taxol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of cell survival and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were made with y-irradiation and, in some cases, several other DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies in eight Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphoblastoid cell lines (four <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 and four mutant p53 cell lines) revealed that the DNA-damaging agents assayed tended to exhibit less growth inhibition in the mutant p53 cell lines compared to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no significant correlation was apparent between p53 gene status and the growth-inhibitory potency of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">Taxol</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> in these eight cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also found that contrary to gamma-irradiation, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">Taxol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> could induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines harboring p53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations were explored further in lymphoblastoid VDSO cells (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53) from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individual and stably transfected VDSO derivatives lacking p53 function due to expression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850011,C0850009" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">human papillomavirus</z:e> type-16 E6 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that p53 disruption in VDSO/E6 cells blocked y-ray-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and afforded a survival advantage to VDSO/E6 cells compared to control-transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, p53 disruption did not affect <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">Taxol</z:chebi>- or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> or survival in VDSO cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of p53 disruption on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">Taxol</z:chebi> sensitivity was explored further in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> MCF-7 and colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> HCT-116 cell lines that had been stably transfected with either the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850011,C0850009" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">human papillomavirus</z:e> type-16 E6 gene or a dominant-negative mutant p53 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Again, in these cell model systems, we found that p53 disruption did not affect the growth-inhibitory potency of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">Taxol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that p53 status is not a dominant factor in the mechanism by which antimitotic agents induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and reduce survival in immortalized human cell lines </plain></SENT>
