<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that CrkL is engaged in Type I IFN signaling, as shown by its rapid tyrosine phosphorylation during engagement of the Type I IFN receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we provide evidence that the related CrkII protein is also rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine during treatment of U-266 and Daudi cells with IFNalpha or IFNbeta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also show that both members of the Crk-family, CrkL and CrkII, are phosphorylated in an interferon-dependent manner in primary hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, inhibition of CrkL or CrkII protein expression by antisense oligonucleotides, reverses the inhibitory effects of IFNalpha or IFNgamma on the proliferation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow progenitor cells (colony forming units-granulocytic/monocytic [CFU-GM] and burst-forming units-erythroid [BFU-E]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, both CrkL and CrkII are engaged in a signaling pathway (s) that mediates interferon-regulated inhibition of hematopoietic cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
