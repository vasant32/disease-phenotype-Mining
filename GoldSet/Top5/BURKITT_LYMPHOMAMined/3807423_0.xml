<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> concentration of lymphocytes was 36 +/- 4 mmol/kg dry weight by atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis and 39 +/- 19 mmol/kg dry weight with electron probe X-ray microanalysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found no significant difference between the results for the two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The coefficient of variation was 30% for <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> concentration among individual cells with electron probe X-ray microanalysis </plain></SENT>
