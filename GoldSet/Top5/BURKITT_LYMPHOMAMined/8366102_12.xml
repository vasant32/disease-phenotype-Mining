<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have identified several discrete protein binding sites within this region of c-myc intron I designated as myc intron factor-1 (MIF-1), MIF-2, and MIF-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to our previous characterization of a 20-nucleotide binding site for MIF-1, we now have identified adjacent 20-nucleotide and 34-nucleotide binding sites for MIF-2 and MIF-3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three elements are protected from exonuclease digestion by nuclear protein extracts, and each gives rise to a distinct migration pattern on mobility shift assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, MIF-1, 2, and 3 share a 5-nucleotide (TTATG) internal sequence, which may account for cross-competition of these binding sites in the exonuclease protection experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deletion mutant analyses showed that selective removal of the MIF-3 binding site alone was sufficient to enhance <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase reporter activity similar to that observed with larger deletions of myc intron I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in activated c-myc alleles are frequently clustered in discrete domains that define protein recognition sequences </plain></SENT>
