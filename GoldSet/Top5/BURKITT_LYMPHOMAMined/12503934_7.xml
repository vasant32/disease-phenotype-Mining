<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a case of nonreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0008619'>bilateral sensorineural hearing loss</z:hpo> resulting from administration of intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: A 63-year-old white man with newly diagnosed pre-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> developed Corynebacterium jeikeium <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> associated with an Ommaya reservoir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi> for several days without symptomatic improvement, and intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi> was added to the treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Difficulty in the patient's hearing was noted after the first intrathecal dose and he experienced <z:mp ids='MP_0001967'>complete hearing loss</z:mp> after the second intrathecal dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An audiogram was performed and the patient was diagnosed with cranial nerve VIII <z:hpo ids='HP_0008619'>bilateral sensorineural hearing loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Ommaya reservoir was removed and the patient was successfully treated with linezolid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235280" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ototoxicity</z:e> with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi> has been documented in multiple case reports, but this adverse effect has not been reported with intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi> concentrations were not measured in our patient, but there was 1 documented occurrence of supratherapeutic serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other drug-related causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235280" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ototoxicity</z:e> were evaluated and intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235280" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ototoxicity</z:e> was considered to be possible according to the Naranjo probability scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The strong temporal relationship that was seen in this case suggests the possibility of an association between administration of intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi> and hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Healthcare providers should consider the potential for this adverse reaction with the intrathecal route of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
