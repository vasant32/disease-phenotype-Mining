<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such repression probably occurs at the transcriptional level since no human mu- and c-myc <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi>'s are detectable in hybrid clones carrying the corresponding genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is therefore concluded that the ability to express these genes requires a differential B cell environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the 3T3 cell assay may not be suitable to detect oncogenes directly involved in human B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e>, since 3T3 cells apparently are incapable of transcribing an oncogene that is highly active in malignant B cells with specific chromosomal translocations </plain></SENT>
