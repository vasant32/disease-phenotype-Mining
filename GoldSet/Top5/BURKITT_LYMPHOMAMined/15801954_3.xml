<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Approximately 6% of paediatric patients with precursor B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) harbour a rearrangement involving the gene regions of PBX1 (1q23) and E2A (19p13.3) which is visualized cytogenetically either as a der(19)t(1;19)(q23;p13.3) or the less common balanced t(1;19)(q23;p13.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, no commercial dual-colour, double fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) strategies are available to detect this recurrent anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have created a D-FISH assay to detect these translocations and monitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This probe set was created using four <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosomes (BACs) corresponding to the PBX1 gene region at 1q23 and four BACs corresponding to the E2A gene region at 19p13.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analysed 30 negative bone marrow controls and 20 diagnostic and post-treatment specimens from 13 paediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> patients with a cytogenetically defined 1;19 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Once unblinded, the results demonstrated that our D-FISH method effectively identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnostic samples as abnormal and identified disease in four post-treatment samples that were previously considered to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by conventional cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The development of this FISH strategy for the detection of der(19)t(1;19)(q23;p13.3) and t(1;19)(q23;p13.3) proved to be an effective technique, allowing both the detection of disease in diagnostic samples and in post-treatment samples </plain></SENT>
