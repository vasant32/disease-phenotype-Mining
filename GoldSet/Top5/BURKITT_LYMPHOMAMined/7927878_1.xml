<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This position lies between the MLV14 and BVR1 loci, 2 variant translocation breakpoints in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The structure of the ZNF7 gene was not altered by translocations in Burkitt-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines as shown by its germline-restriction map configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal region surrounding the ZNF7 gene was extensively methylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ZNF7 gene was not expressed in 19 BL cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression was detected only in the BL41 and BL47 cell lines and in the SW756 cervical-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line </plain></SENT>
