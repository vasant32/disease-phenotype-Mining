<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD27, a transmembrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-linked 55-kD homodimer, belongs to the nerve growth factor-receptor family, a group of homologous molecules involved in lymphocyte differentiation and selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is expressed on mature thymocytes, peripheral blood T cells, and a subpopulation of B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the expression of CD27 on malignant B cells representative for a broad range of stages in physiologic antigen-independent and -dependent B-cell development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissue CD27+ B cells were only found in the peripheral blood (29.8% +/- 10.8%, n = 13) and in germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the exception of pro-B and the majority of pre-pre-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and of <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myelomas</z:mp>, CD27 expression of variable intensity was detected on almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> immature and mature malignant B cells tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay we could show the presence of sometimes very high (up to 6,000 U/mL; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values &lt; 190 U/mL) amounts of the soluble 28- to 32-kD form of CD27 (sCD27) in the sera of patients with B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest levels of sCD27 were observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and low-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, both in transversal and longitudinal studies, we found a strong correlation between sCD27 levels in the serum and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> load, indicating that sCD27 can be used as a disease-marker in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
