<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical and pathological characteristics of patients with this form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have not been well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of the transcription factor SOX11 has been observed in conventional mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether this gene is expressed in cyclin D1-negative mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and whether its detection may be useful to identify these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The microarray database of 238 mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> was re-examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SOX11 protein expression was investigated immunohistochemically in 12 cases of cyclin D1-negative mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 54 cases of conventional mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 209 additional lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SOX11 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was highly expressed in conventional and cyclin D1-negative mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in 33% of the cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but not in any other mature lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SOX11 nuclear protein was detected in 50 cases (93%) of conventional mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and also in the 12 cyclin D1-negative cases of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the six cases of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, in two of eight cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and in two of three T-prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> but was negative in the remaining lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D2 and D3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in cyclin D1-negative mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than in conventional mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but the protein expression was not discriminative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinico-pathological features and outcomes of the patients with cyclin D1-negative mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> identified by SOX11 expression were similar to those of patients with conventional mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SOX11 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and nuclear protein expression is a highly specific marker for both cyclin D1-positive and negative mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
