<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four such lines could be maintained over a period of three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Like the uninfected parental lines, the persistently infected cells display a cyclic pattern of cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of HSV-1-specific antigens proved to be variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, virus yields also vary within a subcultivation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pooled human HSV antisera, when continuously present, suppress virus production (inducible latency) and support cell proliferation to higher rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, removal of the antiserum after a certain period of cultivation leads to virus reactivation with a delay of 8 to 20 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After cultivation periods of more than 3 to 12 weeks, replacement of HSV antiserum does no longer result in virus reactivation and even inducers fail to reactivate </plain></SENT>
