<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Raji cell line was established from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> tissue and used for research worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous study showed that each Raji cell contains an average of 50-60 EBV genome equivalents, and a significant proportion of the EBV genome is linearly integrated into host genome through BamHI-W close to the BamHI-Y fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a definitive EBV integration site in the chromosome has not been identified as yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, direct evidence that EBV DNA is integrated into the host genome was provided through cloning of the fragments containing nucleotide sequence of Raji integration sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Integrated EBV DNA consisted of the BamHI-W fragment at one end and BamHI-D fragment at another end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both junction sites were highly <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi>-rich </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BamHI-W fragment and the adjacent part of chromosome 6 showed 70% homology, while no homology was found between the BamHI-D and adjacent host sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EBV was present at intron 1 of the BACH2 gene located on chromosome 6q15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BACH2 was not expressed in the Raji cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because BACH2 is a putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene, loss of its expression through EBV integration might contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
