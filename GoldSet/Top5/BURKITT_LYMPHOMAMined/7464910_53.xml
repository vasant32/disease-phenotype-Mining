<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We find that removal of O6-MeG occurs rapidly with a half life of less than 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two cell types can be distinguished: mex+, which remove O6-MeG residues produced by incubation with 0.5 microgram ml-1 MNNG, and mex- cells, which are unable to remove the adduct </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The biochemical mechanism for the removal of O6-MeG in human cells is distinct from the excision of adducts produced by compounds such as N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48076">acetoxy</z:chebi>-N-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAAF) or by UV irradiation but it is not clear whether the distinction between mex+ and mex- lines is genetic or epigenetic </plain></SENT>
