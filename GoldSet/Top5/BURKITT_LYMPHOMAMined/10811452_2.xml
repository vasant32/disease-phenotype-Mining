<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved CR by induction therapy, of whom 10 were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>-based regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After consolidation therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except one received high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> followed by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration to collect PBSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> 4 mg/kg for 4 days, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> 20 mg/kg for 3 days and ranimustine 200 mg/m2 for 2 days as a conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
