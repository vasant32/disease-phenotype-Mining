<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The percentage of B cells, circulating T cells, and thymocytes able to bind to the B-LCL Raji were 0%, 59 +/- 4% and 61 +/- 6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage of rosettes formed between Raji cells and circulating mononuclear cells from 92 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals was 27.8 +/- 5.3%, and remained stable over several months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon seems to involve relatively mature B cells, and a T cell marker which appears early in T cell ontogeny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the peripheral blood, most of the B-LCL binding T cells exhibit a 'helper-inducer' phenotype, as determined with the monoclonal antibodies Leu 3a and OKT4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a significant percentage of T cells with so-called 'cytotoxic-suppressor' markers (Leu 2a and OKT8) also bind to B-LCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The T cells involved in this morphological interactive reaction with B cells might conceivably be specifically involved in regulating B cell functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Enumeration of this particular subset may be useful in conditions where abnormal T-B cell interactions are suspected </plain></SENT>
