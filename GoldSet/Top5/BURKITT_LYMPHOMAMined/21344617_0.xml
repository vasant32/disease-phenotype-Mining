<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness and the toxicity of a non-intensive chemotherapy protocol combining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> in children with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the maxillofacial region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: A retrospective descriptive study was carried out in patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of maxillofacial region who received at least one weekly treatment with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> between 1999 and 2006 in a university teaching hospital in Burkina Faso </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The demographic characteristics of the patients, the effectiveness and the toxicity of the treatment were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 58 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 7.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to Murphy's staging, 28 patients (48%) were at stage I, 18 (31%) at stage II, 11 (19%) at stage III and 1 (2%) at stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 28 patients who received <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cycles of the protocol, 21 (75%) achieved complete remission, 6 (21%) had partial remission and 1 (4%) had progressive disease </plain></SENT>
