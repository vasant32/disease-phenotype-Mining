<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this meta-analysis was to synthesize current evidence regarding the association between birth weight with primarily the risk for non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), given its similarity to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) and any category of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two cohort (278,751 children) and seven case-control studies (2,660 cases and 69,274 controls) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects estimates regarding NHL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> and any <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were appropriately pooled using fixed or random effects model in two separate analyses: specifically, high was compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or any birth weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, low was compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or any birth weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant association was found between high birth weight, as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> birth weight, and risk for NHL plus Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.76-1.80, random effects), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.64-1.38, fixed effects) or any plus Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.76-1.56, fixed effects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A null association emerged when low was compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> birth weight for NHL plus Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.71-1.62, random effects), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.54-1.65, fixed effects) or any plus Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.79-1.33, fixed effects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, no association was found when high or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> was compared to any birth weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although current evidence suggests no association, birth weight might be a too crude indicator to reveal a genuine association of fetal growth with specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> categories; hence, there is an emerging need for use of more elaborate proxies, at least those accounting for gestational week </plain></SENT>
