<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The rae28 gene (rae28) is a murine homologue of the Drosophila polyhomeotic gene, which is a member of the Polycomb-group genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the role of rae28 in lymphocyte development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because homozygous rae28-deficient (rae28-/-) mice died in the perinatal period, we examined lymphocyte development by generating chimeric mice reconstituted with green fluorescence protein-labeled mutant fetal liver cells as well as in in vitro culture systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further examined RAE28 expression by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay in human leukemic cells with B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severe B-cell maturation arrest was observed in rae28-/- between pro- and pre-B lymphocyte stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>B-cell development was also delayed in heterozygous neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, interleukin-7-dependent colony-forming ability was impaired not only in homozygous lymphocytes but also in heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Its human homologue, RAE28, is located on chromosome 12p13, which frequently is associated with chromosomal abnormalities and loss of heterozygosity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To determine whether a link exists between RAE28 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, we examined RAE28 expression in leukemic cells from pediatric patients with B-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RAE28 expression was not detected in four B-cell precursor ALL cases of a total of 43 examined, although RAE28 is normally expressed constitutively during the process of B-cell maturation as assessed in isolated cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>rae28 plays an important role in the early B-cell developmental stage in a gene dosage-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the human RAE28 locus may provide a candidate gene causing the molecular pathogenesis of childhood B-cell precursor ALL </plain></SENT>
