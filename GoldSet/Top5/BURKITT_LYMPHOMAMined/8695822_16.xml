<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Purging strategies that are able to remove these contaminating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells need to be developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study describes how electroporation (EP) can be used to improve intracellular delivery of synthetic antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), thereby enhancing their ability to suppress a target protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antisense ODNs that were introduced into cells by EP led to immediate suppression of targeted c-myc protein; this was associated with rapid cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the diffuse histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, U937; Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, ST486; <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo>, MCF-7; and Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, CHP-100, cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electroporation was found to have little or no detrimental effect on cells responsible for murine hematopoietic long-term reconstitution as determined from in vivo competitive repopulation studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using human c-myc-directed antisense ODNs as a model for the application of this approach to bone marrow purging, selective killing of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> U937 cells relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow cells was shown in cell mixing studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo studies were performed in which a survival advantage was shown for athymic mice that were inoculated with antisense-treated U937 cells as opposed to control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that EP of bone marrow may be of use in enhancing intracellular delivery of a variety of molecular/pharmaceutical agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that the use of electroporation to enhance delivery of antisense ODNs is a promising new approach towards ex vivo bone marrow purging </plain></SENT>
