<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although activating mutations in ras genes are the most common genetic abnormality in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, the role of ras mutations as an initiating event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the consequences of ectopic expression of an activated ras gene in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic cells in vivo, lethally irradiated mice were reconstituted with bone marrow cells infected with a mutant ras-containing retrovirus [murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-v-H-ras] based on the MSCV retroviral vector which efficiently transduces functional genes into hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite a marked myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> detectable in the peripheral blood within 4 weeks of engraftment, none of 22 primary or secondary transplant recipients studied for longer periods of time presented with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Instead, 18 of the MSCV-v-H-ras mice developed pre-T-cell thymic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and/or pre-B-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> between 7 and 12 weeks post-transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pre-B and pre-T <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp> that arose in one animal were shown to harbor a common MSCV-v-H-ras provirus, indicating that the target cell for transformation was a bipotential lymphoid precursor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To more precisely examine the effects of activated ras expression on the behavior of hematopoietic progenitors, infected bone marrow cells were assayed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> cultures under conditions favorable for growth of multilineage myeloid colonies or were passaged as bulk suspension cultures in the presence of various hematopoietic growth factors, including interleukin (IL)-3, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MSCV-directed expression of v-H-ras selectively promoted the formation of large dense colonies comprised of monocyte-macrophages in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When transferred to liquid cultures, the vast majority of the cells underwent terminal macrophage differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By comparison, tumorigenic B-lymphoid and mixed lymphoid/myeloid cell lines were routinely established from the bulk suspension cultures, with cell lines of predominantly myeloid phenotype emerging only in IL-6-supplemented cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results, considered together with previous findings, suggest that activating ras mutations could be an initiating genetic alteration in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> but are more likely to be a post-initiation change in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
