<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of an arginine-utilizing mycoplasma, Mycoplasma arginini, and of varying levels of arginine in the growth media of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-containing EB1 and EB3 cell lines, and the EBV-free RPMI 1788 cell line, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>l-Arginine, at a concentration of 0.1 mM in the growth medium, led to a reduction of the EBV capsid antigen content of the EB1 and EB3 cells lines as determined by indirect immunofluorescence, and M. arginini <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> enhanced this reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The synthesis of two immune products, interferon and macrophage migration inhibition factor, was enhanced by growing the cell lines in medium containing arginine at a concentration of 0.1 mM, but the RPMI 1788 cell line produced much less of both products than EB1 or EB3 under these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> of the cell lines with M. arginini reduced the amount of interferon produced and completely inhibited macrophage migration inhibition factor synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The addition of arginine to a final concentration of 0.6 mM in the growth medium caused a dual effect: the EB1 and EB3 cell lines maintained the original level of EBV capsid antigens, even when infected with M. arginini; immune product synthesis was greatly reduced or completely inhibited by the addition of arginine, and M. arginini <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> caused no further reduction of immune product synthesis </plain></SENT>
