<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: Human sera were obtained from 68 children with primary B-lineage ALL at diagnosis and 46 healthy children (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum level of IgM, IgG, IgA, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, antitumor antibody, homogeneous IgG were quantified by turbidimetric or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean values of serum IgM, IgG, IgA at diagnosis were not differed significantly in ALL patients and control children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of IgM and IgG1 inversely correlated with white blood cell (WBC) count in PB of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> range of serum IgG, separated by 25th and 75th percentiles of IgG variables, was associated in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0000221'>decreased WBC count</z:mp> in PB but not in bone marrow (BM) versus patients with low concentration of IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> range of IgG also favors low frequency of homogeneous IgG and antitumor antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with high level of IgG, besides increased frequency of homogeneous IgG and antitumor antibodies, had worse 3-year overall survival (OS) rate as compared to patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of IgG (58.8 vs. 91.2%, P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of serum IgG at diagnosis is a beneficial prognostic factor associated with lower rate of leukemic cell persistence in PB and better outcome of childhood B-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
