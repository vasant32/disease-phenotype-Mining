<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of three EBV open reading frames (ORF's), BBRF3, BILF1 and BMRF2 in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B lymphocytes from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> (A-T) homozygotes, was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A-T is a human recessive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> which predisposes homozygotes and heterozygotes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computer analysis (Robson-Garnier) was used to study the secondary structure of EBV ORF's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three ORF's (BBRF3, BILF1 and BMRF2) found by the Kyte and Doolittle computer method to have multiple hydrophobic domains in the putative <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were selected, and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were selected, and the respective cloned EBV DNA fragments were used as probes to detect <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and L-6 A-T lines that was not present in the L-15 A-T line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probe for BILF1 detected two <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species (3.7 and 2.0 kb) in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoblastoid and A-T L-6 lines, while only the 3.7 kb <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed in the A-T L-15 lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probe for BMRF2 detected two <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species (3.7 and 2.1 kb) in the EBV-transformed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoblasts and in one A-T line (L6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BMRF2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were not detected in the other A-T line (L-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study indicated that regulation of the three EBV genes in two EBV-transformed A-T lymphoblastoid lines, differs from that in the EBV-transformed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoblastoid line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the A-T line L-6, the three EBV genes were expressed as in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells originating from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor (L-21) and in the P3HR1 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The A-T line L-15 differed from L-6 and the other cell lines in that it expressed only one (3.7 kb) <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> species from BILF1 ORF, while ORFs BBRF3 and BMRF2 were not expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since A-T L-15 line contains EBV DNA genomes, and EBV VCA is not present in these cells prior to or after <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> treatment, it is suggested that EBV gene expression is regulated by these A-T lymphoblastoid cells in a manner different from that which operates in other EBV transformed cell lines </plain></SENT>
