<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas no effect was detected in the younger gonads, some structural changes were observed in bovine and 21-day-old rat ovaries when cultured for 5 days with Daudi and male <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo> supernatants, but there was no synthesis of <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> or MIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These observations raise questions concerning the critical period of sensitivity to H--Y antigen of female gonads, and the dissociation between morphologic and biochemical events </plain></SENT>
