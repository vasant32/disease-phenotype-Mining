<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis indicated that amino acids 365 to 992 are important for EBV-mediated immortalization of B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that this region of EBNA3C critical for immortalization interacts with prothymosin alpha (ProTalpha), a cellular protein previously identified to be important for cell division and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This interaction maps to a region downstream of amino acid 365 known to be involved in transcription regulation and critical for EBV-mediated transformation of primary B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we show that EBNA3C also interacts with p300, a cellular acetyltransferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This interaction suggests a possible role in regulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation and chromatin remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation was observed in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines, which is consistent with increased cellular gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cells express the entire repertoire of latent nuclear antigens, including EBNA3C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of EBNA3C in cells with increased acetyltransferase activity mediated by the EBV transactivator EBNA2 results in down-modulation of this activity in a dose-responsive manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The interactions of EBNA3C with ProTalpha and p300 provide new evidence implicating this essential EBV protein EBNA3C in modulating the acetylation of cellular factors, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hence, EBNA3C plays a critical role in balancing cellular transcriptional events by linking the biological property of mediating inhibition of EBNA2 transcription activation and the observed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetyltransferase activity, thereby orchestrating immortalization of EBV-infected cells </plain></SENT>
