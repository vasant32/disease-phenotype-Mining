<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologic transformation to high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, generally to diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, occurs in 25-35% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although t(14;18), the cytogenetic hallmark of FL, has been found in approximately 85% of these cases, multiple secondary cytogenetic and molecular genetic changes underlie the transformation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 58-year-old patient who presented with stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IVA</z:e>, grade 2 FL that subsequently transformed to Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple chromosomal aberrations, including three novel translocations, were observed related to this transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inversion (1)(p36.3q12) and t(3;14;18)(p23;q32;q21) occurred prior to transformation and may have contributed to the transformation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A t(1;11)(q25;q13) was acquired simultaneously with t(8;22) and, in conjunction with other chromosomal abnormalities, coincided with an extremely aggressive clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequent breakage of 1q observed in this case suggests that the region harbors important genomic signals for the transformation of FL </plain></SENT>
