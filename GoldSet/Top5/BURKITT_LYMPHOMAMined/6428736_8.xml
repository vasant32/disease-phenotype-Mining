<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report investigations in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of the following enzymes were determined: terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> polymerase alpha (DP alpha), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26394">purine nucleoside</z:chebi> phosphorylase (PNP), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> kinases (TK and UK, respectively), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> phosphorylase (ThPh) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cytochemical investigations were done in the group of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LL), and ultrastructural studies were performed in seven of the nine LL of this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results were obtained: (1) TdT (90 cases) was highly specific for LL; eight of nine LL were positive, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other histologic types were negative; the only TdT-, acid esterase (AcE) positive, nonconvoluted LL was probably related to TdT- <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> medullary thymocytes, and had an unfavorable clinical course with resistance to a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>-and-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>-including treatment; (2) <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> (61 cases) could distinguish clearly between the high levels of LL and the low levels found in any other group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; among LL, the highest values were found in T-cell-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>, and the lowest value in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>) positive, acid phosphatase negative case that showed the presence of large nucleoli at the ultrastructural analysis, a finding that is unusual for LL and possibly related to a more immature differentiation stage; (3) PNP (39 cases) values alone were not clinically relevant, but together with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> levels, a subset of T-LL with high <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>:PNP ratio could be selected among LL; (4) DP alpha (61 cases), and TK and UK (37 cases) were found in concentrations reflecting the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> of the non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and were more elevated in the high-grade malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; (5) ThPh (34 cases) was always elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, but low in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and LL; thus, they had a high TK:ThPh ratio that could be useful in predicting clinical response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors think that taken together, multiple enzyme determinations could be useful in the characterization of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
