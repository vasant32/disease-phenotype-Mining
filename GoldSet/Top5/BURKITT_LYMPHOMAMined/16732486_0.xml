<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate therapeutic targets for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, this study investigates the effect of PI3-K/Akt pathway in: EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines Raji, P3HR-1, Akata and Daudi; and EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines Ramos and BJAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results of analyses indicate that Akt was constitutively phosphorylated in BJAB, P3HR-1, Akata, and Daudi but not in Ramos and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We characterized Akt phosphorylation on cell growth and EBV lytic cycle in P3HR-1 cells, which were phosphorylated most intensively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Akt was equally phosphorylated in cells cultured with and without fetal bovine serum for a few days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Akt phosphorylation and cell growth were inhibited by PI3-K specific inhibitor LY294002 in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LY294002 markedly down regulated expression of EBV lytic gene BRLF1 protein Rta, BMRF1 protein EA-D, but not BZLF1 protein ZEBRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inhibitor reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (VCA) positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Down regulation of Rta by LY294002 occurred at the transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that PI3-K/Akt pathway is activated constitutively in P3HR-1 cells; it promotes cell growth and the lytic cycle cascade downstream of ZEBRA </plain></SENT>
