<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The protocol consisted of a remission-induction phase that lasted 30 days and started with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>) 1.2 g/m2 on day 1, followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> (VCR) 1.5 mg/m2 on days 3, 10, 17, and 24, daunomycin (DAUNO) 60 mg/m2 on days 12 and 13, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> 40 mg/m2/d for 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If a complete remission was achieved, an intensification regimen was given that consisted of eight courses of teniposide (VM-26) 165 mg/m2 plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (ARA-C) 300 mg/m2 every 4 days according to bone marrow tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A continuation phase was subsequently started, with alternating courses of thioguanine (6-TG) 300 mg/m2/d for 4 days plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36467">CTX 1</z:chebi>.2 g/m2 on day 5; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> 2.5 g/m2/d for 4 days plus DAUNO 45 mg/m2 on day 5; VCR 1.5 mg/m2 plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) 120 mg/m2 (24 hours apart); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50667">mercaptopurine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi>) 500 mg/m2/d for 4 days plus MTX 40 mg/m2; and VM-26 plus ARA-C for 3 courses (4 days apart), by the end of 48 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> prophylaxis consisted of intrathecal administration of MTX, ARA-C, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> according to age, administered three times during remission induction and every 6 weeks afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By the end of the analysis in July 1991, 38 of 39 patients had attained a complete remission and 36 were event-free survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two failures that occurred after completion of therapy were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancies</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results are significantly better than those obtained with less intensive former regimens performed in our institution before the availability of VM-26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The favorable impact of an intense consolidation phase with VM-26 is remarkably exemplified by three additional patients not included in this study whose families withdrew them from therapy after the intensification phase, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three of whom have been in remission </plain></SENT>
