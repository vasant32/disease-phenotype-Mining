<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A set of B-cell activation markers, including the EBV/C3d receptor [complement receptor type 2 (CR2) (CD21)], the 45-kDa lymphoblastoid cell-associated (Blast-2) antigen (CD23), and the B-cell restricted activation (Bac-1) antigen (which was recently identified as a potential B-cell growth factor receptor) can be turned on by infecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells that are genome negative for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with the B95-8 immortalizing strain of the virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nonimmortalizing EBV variant, strain P3HR-1, which possesses a deletion within the BamHI WYH region of the genome containing the coding sequence for the EBV-determined nuclear antigen 2, does not induce expression of these markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other lymphoblastoid cell-associated antigen markers can be activated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with either immortalizing or nonimmortalizing viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the immortalizing potential of EBV is correlated with its ability to induce expression of B-cell activation markers, which are suspected to play a major role in the physiological pathway leading to lymphoid cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomic region deleted in the nonimmortalizing strain of EBV seems to be required for activation of some of these markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, such as those used in this study, can thus help identify the specific EBV genes involved in lymphoid B-cell proliferation and the mechanism of action of these genes </plain></SENT>
