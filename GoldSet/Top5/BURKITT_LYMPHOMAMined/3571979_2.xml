<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The transformation of human agranular blood lymphocytes into large granular lymphocytes (LGL) was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the average, 2.8% of peripheral blood lymphocytes differentiate in less than 24 hr into LGL when cultured with autologous plastic-adherent monocytes and the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LGL precursors were intermediate-density lymphoid cells that were heterogenous for T3, T8, and Leu-7 antigens, negative for T4 and Leu-11, and positive for NK-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the transformation, frequency of Leu-11-positive cells increased and the cytotoxic activity was augmented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In single cell cytotoxicity experiments, the number of binding cells increased, whereas the number of killer cells among the binding cells remained unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The transformation inducing factor was detectable in coculture supernatants of Raji and monocytes or Raji and the myeloid cell line ML-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses of the Raji-ML-2 coculture supernatants with reverse phase and gel filtration high-pressure liquid chromatography indicated that the factor is a heat- and trypsin-sensitive hydrophilic molecule with an apparent m.w. of 1000 </plain></SENT>
