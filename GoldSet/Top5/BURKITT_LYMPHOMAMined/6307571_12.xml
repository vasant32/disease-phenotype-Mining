<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Four Venezuelan patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007965" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chediak-Higashi syndrome</z:e> (CHS) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results confirm the severe reduction in natural killer (NK) cell activity, as previously described and showed also a decline in the activity of cells involved in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No defect was found in the production of immunoglobulins and of specific antibodies to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e>, varicella, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e>, and cytomegalo viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients had extremely high antibody titers to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) specific <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (VCA), to the restricted (R) component of the EBV-induced early antigen complex, and to the EBV-associated nuclear antigen (EBNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>enlarged livers</z:hpo>, spleens, and lymph nodes indicative of the lymphoproliferative phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other two patients were initially negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBV-associated antibodies but seroconverted subsequently and, in the course of a year, also developed high antibody titers to VCA and R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one of these patients the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary infection</z:e> was accompanied by moderate signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (IM) followed after more than 6 months by persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other patient also developed signs of a lymphoproliferative syndrome with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> and died 8 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such high anti-R titers are seen frequently in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but rarely in other conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the high antibody titers reflect an increased production of VCA and R due to defective NK and ADCC cell activities so that productively infected B lymphocytes are no longer eliminated before they have synthesized maximal amounts of antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The high anti-EBNA titers suggest <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T lymphocyte function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The possibility that the accelerated, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like phase of the CHS involves EBV-transformed cells is discussed </plain></SENT>
