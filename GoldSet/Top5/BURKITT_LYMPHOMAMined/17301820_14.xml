<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As histopathogenesis is relevant for B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) prognosis, TRF-L was assessed by Southern blot in 201 patients and compared to variable immunoglobulin heave chain gene mutational status (VH-MS) and to other known prognostic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS), time to first treatment (TTFT) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate the following: (1) TRF-L is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> among B-CLL patients (median 6014 bp, range 1465-16 762); (2) TRF-L correlates to VH-MS (r(2)=0.1994, P&lt;0.0001) with VH-mutated patients showing long and VH-unmutated short telomeres; however, 41% of VH-unmutated and 5% of VH-mutated patients did not show this correlation and were thus defined as 'discordant'; (3) TRF-L effectively predicts outcome in terms of TTFT, PFS and OS; (4) VH-unmutated discordant patients have a better clinical outcome than VH-unmutated concordant patients (OS P&lt;0.01, PFS P&lt;0.05) and similar to that of VH-mutated patients (OS, PFS P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to VH-unmutated concordant patients, VH-unmutated discordant patients showed no peculiarity in their immunoglobulin rearrangement nor in their flow cytometry or fluorescence in situ hybridization profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, TRF-L can be helpful to refine prognostication of B-CLL patients, particularly those with a VH-unmutated immunoglobulin sequence </plain></SENT>
