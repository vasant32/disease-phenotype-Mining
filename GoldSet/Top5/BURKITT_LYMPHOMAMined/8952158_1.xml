<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Adult B/L3-ALL is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e> subset characterized by an aggressive clinical course and a poor response to conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALL</z:e>-type chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data from the GMALL Group showed that prognosis can be improved with an innovative treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current retrospective survey we focus on therapeutic results obtained at our Institutions during a 15-year period with ALL-type regimens in 34 adults with either B/L3-ALL or advanced-stage Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five successive ALL treatment programs were developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They included a homogeneous induction phase with early intrathecal chemoprophylaxis, multidrug postremission consolidation followed by cranial irradiation (4 trials), high-dose chemotherapy plus autografting (2 trials), late consolidation (2 trials), and variable-length maintenance (4 trials) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early response and prolonged disease-free survival rates were analyzed according to selected clinical and therapeutic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, a complete remission was achieved in 62%, with a median duration of 1.6 years and a 10-year remission rate of 49% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of B/L3-ALL (p = 0.007), the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> instead of adriamycin during induction (p = 0.018), a serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &lt; 1.6 mg/dL, and an uninvolved central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system were associated with higher response rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As regards long-term disease-free survival, results were significantly better in patients with &lt; 1 x 10(9)/L L3/blast cells in the peripheral blood (p = 0.0029) and/or aged &lt; 50 years (p = 0.04), and in those consolidated with the most recent rotational high-dose plus peripheral blood stem cell autotransplant regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to the results presented, ALL-like regimens may still represent a worthwhile therapeutic choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> during induction, the prognostic subclassification of patients, a careful control of dysmetabolic complications, the selection of the proper chemo-radioprevention for meningeal disease and perhaps the introduction of high-dose chemotherapy supported by autologous stem cell rescue appear to be the mainstay of further improvements </plain></SENT>
