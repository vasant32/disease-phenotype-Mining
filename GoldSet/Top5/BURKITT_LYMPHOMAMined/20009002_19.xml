<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is to enlarge the growing body of evidence concerning (18)F-FDG avidity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to provide a basis for future guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The reports from (18)F-FDG PET/CT studies performed in a single center for staging of 1,093 patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> between 2001 and 2008 were reviewed for the presence of (18)F-FDG avidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 766 patients with a histopathologic diagnosis verified according to the World Health Organization classification were included in the final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(18)F-FDG avidity was defined as the presence of at least 1 focus of (18)F-FDG uptake reported as a disease site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonavidity was defined as disease proven by clinical examination, conventional imaging modalities, and histopathology with no (18)F-FDG uptake in any of the involved sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At least one (18)F-FDG-<z:chebi fb="156" ids="39214">avid</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> site was reported for 718 patient studies (94%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight patients (6%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> not <z:chebi fb="156" ids="39214">avid</z:chebi> for (18)F-FDG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(18)F-FDG avidity was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (100%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> (n = 233), Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 18), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 14), nodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 8), and lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An (18)F-FDG avidity of 97% was found in patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (216/222), 95% for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (133/140), 85% for T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (34/40), 83% for small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (24/29), and 55% for extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (29/53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study indicated that with the exception of extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes have high (18)F-FDG avidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cumulating evidence consistently showing high (18)F-FDG avidity in the potentially curable Burkitt, natural killer/T-cell, and anaplastic large T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes justifies further investigations of the utility of (18)F-FDG PET in these diseases at presentation </plain></SENT>
