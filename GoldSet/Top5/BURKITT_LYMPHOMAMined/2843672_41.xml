<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The virus-induced target antigens recognized by these immune T cells have not been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our experiments, EBV DNA sequences encoding the virus latent gene products Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA)1, EBNA 2, and EBNA-LP and the latent membrane protein (LMP) were individually expressed in a virus-negative human B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Louckes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfected clones expressing LMP were killed by EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell preparations from each of three virus-immune donors HLA matched with Louckes through HLA-A2, B44 antigens; control transfectants or clones expressing one of the EBNA proteins were not recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of LMP in a second virus-negative B-cell line, BL41, sensitized these cells to EBV-specific cytolysis restricted through the HLA-A11 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To distinguish between the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein and an induced human B-cell activation antigen as the target for T-cell recognition, LMP was then expressed in a murine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_350'>mastocytoma</z:mpath> cell line, P815-A11-restricted human T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The LMP-expressing P815-A11 transfectants were susceptible to lysis by EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells from three HLA-A11-positive individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both Louckes and P815-A11 cells were also transfected with constructs capable of encoding a truncated form of LMP (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>-LMP) which lacks the N-terminal 128 amino acids of the full-length protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>-LMP-expressing transfectants were not recognized by the above T-cell preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that LMP, and, in particular, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> derived from the N-terminal region of the protein, provides one of the target antigens for the EBV-induced human cytotoxic T-cell response </plain></SENT>
