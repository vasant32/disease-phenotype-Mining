<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Biopsy samples obtained from 20 patients with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV)-associated non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) were assessed for evidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HIV sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded NHL tissue and specific <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene sequences were sought using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBV sequences were found in 10 NHL samples (50%), with five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showing A-type and five B-type sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By serologic testing, 18 of 19 patients had antibodies to EBV, with 14 patients having antibodies to A-type EBV and 11 to B-type EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serology confirmed the high prevalence of type B EBV in HIV-infected patients, but was not a reliable indicator of the EBV subtype present in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HIV sequences were present in biopsy tissue but at a level consistent with an origin from bystander HIV-infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 20 patients were negative by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to human T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus-type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of type B EBV in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is similar to the findings in endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, where 40% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> have type B <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> populations, type B EBV is rarely found outside the nasopharynx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies support the hypothesis that EBV is an important cofactor in NHL in HIV-infected persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The finding that B-type EBV is present in 25% of HIV-associated NHL suggests that this EBV subtype may be an important human pathogen with a wider geographic distribution than originally thought </plain></SENT>
