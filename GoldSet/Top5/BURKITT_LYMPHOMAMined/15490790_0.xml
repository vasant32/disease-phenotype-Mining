<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histopathological slides and duplicate copies of reports were retrieved and re-examined while fresh sections were processed from original paraffin blocks when necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>Liver cancers</z:hpo> constituted 56.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> liver biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>Hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo>, which was commonest in the fifth decade, occurred in 64.1%, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumours</z:e>, which were commonest in the sixth decade, accounted for 24.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary sites could only be determined in 5 out of the 35 metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age range of patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 6-17 years with an average of 10.8 years and a male/female ratio of 3:2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was preponderance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> in males while <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumours</z:e> were commoner in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pattern of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> demonstrated in this study agrees with what generally obtains for endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in this environment </plain></SENT>
