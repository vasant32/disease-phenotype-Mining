<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases studies were performed in parallel on cell suspensions and cryostat sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were classified as anaplastic centrocytic (four), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> (seven), Burkitt type (three), convoluted-cell type (five) lymphoblastic-unclassified (10), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> (IBL) (19) and pleomorphic T-cell type (five) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunological phenotyping resulted in 60% B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> characterized by monotypic surface membrane Ig (SmIg) and/or cytoplasmic Ig (CIg), and 23% T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with detectable E receptors; 17% of cases were non-expressive (O-type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unusual SmIg-types were noticed in some monoclonal proliferations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gamma (gamma) and mu chains occurred simultaneously in four cases; delta chain was the only heavy-chain in one case and a heavy-chain was absent in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases of IBL were of T-cell type in two cases, and two other cases were non-expressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cases of B-IBL expressed CIg in 93%, but the B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> other than B-IBL only in 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Receptors for Fc-IgG and C3 were expressed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major immune phenotypes (B, T, O), but were infrequent in lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> unclassified (O-type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adoption of immunological techniques to include frozen tissue studies was necessary in order to reach a conclusion regarding the immune phenotype in several cases </plain></SENT>
