<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, therefore, the relationship between leukemic blast <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels and prognosis in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 77 childhood ALL samples were analyzed, 62 at initial presentation and 15 at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 20-fold interindividual variation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels at presentation (median, 6.54 nmol/mg protein; range, 1.37 to 27.9) was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median level in T-lineage ALL was 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3-fold higher than in B-lineage ALL (Mann-Whitney test, P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between presenting white cell count (WBC) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> level (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, rho = 0.45, P =.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high DNA index correlated with low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels (Mann-Whitney test, P =.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels and in vitro drug sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels above the median had a significantly greater risk of relapse (log-rank test statistic, 5.55; P =.018), and the overall survival rate was significantly reduced (log-rank test statistic, 4.38; P =.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> concentration was of independent prognostic value when assessed in conjunction with age, gender, WBC, and immunophenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association of elevated blast <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels with an increased risk of relapse suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-depleting agents may be of therapeutic value in patients who present with a high WBC </plain></SENT>
