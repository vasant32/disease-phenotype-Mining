<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 6-year-old boy suffered from a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, characterized histologically by a fulminant polyclonal immunoblast proliferation simulating malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with many immunoblasts resembling Reed-Sternberg cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> but Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was evident from serological findings, and EBV-associated nuclear antigen (EBNA) was demonstrated in a high percentage of lymphocytes of blood and lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An adequate humoral response to EBV ruled out the possibility of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> recessive lymphoproliferative syndrome as the underlying cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A chromosomal defect in a subpopulation of lymphocytes was induced by interferon and might somehow be associated with a subtle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> of our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After exacerbation of the disease chemotherapy was included in the treatment but the patient died 9 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At autopsy the lymphoblastic cell proliferation had changed from that of immunoblasts to cells resembling the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A change of the proliferating cell type was supported by means of cytochemical and immunological cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of EBV in these cells was demonstrated with the EBNA technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that our case may well support the hypothesis, that EBV may induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like polyclonal immunoblast proliferation in immunodeficient individuals, and that occasionally a monoclonal proliferation of the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> type may supervene </plain></SENT>
