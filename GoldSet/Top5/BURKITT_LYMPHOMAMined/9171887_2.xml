<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mb-1 gene encodes the Ig-alpha component of the B-cell antigen receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is specifically expressed in pre-B and mature B cells but not in plasma cells losing membrane Ig (mIg) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We looked for transcriptional regulatory elements within a 12 kb genomic fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A strong promoter activity was found in a 591 bp fragment harboring consensus binding sites for known transcription factors including Ets, EBF/BlyF, LyF1/micro B and Spl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was able to drive transcription of a reporter gene in the absence of any additional enhancer and was mostly active in B lymphocytes not in plasma cells or T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although no fragment from the mb-1 gene displayed enhancer activity in combination with either the SV40, a Ig VH or a Ig VL promoter, a 1078 bp fragment corresponding to the 5' part of the gene behaved as a strong enhancer in either orientation in constructs driven by the mb-1 promoter itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deletions within this fragment allowed to delineate shorter sequences with enhancer activity upstream the first exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The tissue-restricted, promoter-restricted and stage-specific activity of this 5' flanking region suggests that it is the main regulatory element of the mb-1 gene </plain></SENT>
