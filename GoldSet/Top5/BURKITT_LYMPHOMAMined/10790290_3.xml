<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies have found a possible correlation between increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence and environmental ELF EMF exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results from in vitro studies performed to examine the possible underlying bioeffects of ELF EMFs have varied greatly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reported effects range from robust and reproducible effects to undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, Daudi cells were exposed to 60 Hz magnetic fields for 20, 40 or 60 min at flux densities of 12.5, 50, 100 or 500 microT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exposures were performed in the Regional ELF-EMF Exposure Facility (Rockville, MD) to minimize variables that might contribute to a false positive effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposures included sham/sham, exposed/sham or sham/exposed, and were performed with blinding with respect to type of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) treatment was used as a positive control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total cellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was isolated using a single-step technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Human MYC expression was measured by northern blot hybridization as an indicator of the responsiveness of Daudi cells to experimental conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) expression was measured simultaneously as an internal control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Exposure to a 60 Hz magnetic field did not significantly alter MYC expression in Daudi cells under any of the exposure conditions </plain></SENT>
