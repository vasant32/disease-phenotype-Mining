<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Soluble forms of several cytokine receptors have been described and may play a role in the modulation of cytokine activity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, we investigated whether human hematopoietic cells produce soluble c-kit receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines OCIM1 and MO7e display approximately 80,000 and approximately 35,000 high-affinity cell surface c-kit receptors, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Soluble c-kit receptors were detected by enzyme immunoassay in OCIM1 and MO7e culture supernatants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We determined the molecular weight and binding affinity of soluble c-kit receptor produced by OCIM1 cells, soluble c-kit receptor purified from human serum, and recombinant soluble c-kit receptor expressed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The three soluble c-kit receptors each have a molecular weight of 98 kD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantitative binding experiments with 125I-SCF indicate that the soluble c-kit receptors obtained from human serum or OCIM1 cells have binding affinities for SCF of approximately 200 to 300 pmol/L, in contrast to the recombinant form, which has a binding affinity of approximately 1.5 nmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three forms of the soluble c-kit receptor were able to compete with c-kit receptors on OCIM1 cells for 125I-SCF binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus human hematopoietic cells can produce a soluble form of the c-kit receptor that retains high-affinity SCF binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the soluble c-kit receptor may bind SCF and function as a receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> in vivo </plain></SENT>
