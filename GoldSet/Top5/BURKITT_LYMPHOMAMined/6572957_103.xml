<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Molecular cloning has recently established that the 15;12 chromosome translocations in murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> fuse DNA from chromosome 15 to the immunoglobulin heavy (H) chain locus, usually within the switch recombination region near the alpha constant region gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show here that the incoming DNA bears the cellular gene (c-myc) homologous to the oncogene (v-myc) of avian retrovirus MC29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> bearing an 8;14 translocation, c-myc was also rearranged, apparently (in at least two cases) to an H chain switch recombination region (mu or alpha), and both products of a reciprocal chromosome exchange were detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the murine and human c-myc genes contain two exons homologous to v-myc, and additional 5' and 3' murine genomic segments (apparent exons) were defined by hybridization to c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo>, chromosome breakpoints fall near or within the 5' exon and apparently disrupt the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc transcriptional unit, because <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> differ from the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in lines without c-myc rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The translocated gene presumably has lost its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 5' regulatory sequences and may well encode an altered myc <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that altered expression of the c-myc gene, induced by translocation to an immunoglobulin locus, is a critical oncogenic event for these B <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two events may be required, because the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> oncogene capable of transforming fibroblasts is not c-myc </plain></SENT>
