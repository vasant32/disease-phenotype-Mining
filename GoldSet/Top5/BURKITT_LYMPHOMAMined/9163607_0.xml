<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is used for ex-vivo expansion of myeloid progenitors in the setting of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) was examined in six fresh Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell preparations and 12 BL cell lines by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inducibility of IL-6R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was studied by comparing two uninfected cell lines with the same cell lines infected by EBV The phenotype of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells lines was analysed by FCM and by proliferation assays in the presence of anti-IgM antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells expressed the IL-6 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines expressed varying degrees of IL-6R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines resulted in up-regulation of IL-6R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no proliferative response of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines to IL-6, including the cells that expressed the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to uninfected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines, EBV-infected cell lines and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) showed a weaker or no response to anti-IgM antibodies, indicating a more mature phenotype of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the IL-6 receptor is not expressed in fresh childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>, but only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in vitro leads to an up-regulation of IL-6R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> but not to increased proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This makes growth stimulation of contaminating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells in the setting of autologous BMT unlikely </plain></SENT>
