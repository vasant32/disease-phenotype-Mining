<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) complex and its link to the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) molecules in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> cell lines was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gel retardation and Western blot analyses revealed a high level of constitutively activated STAT3 in 5 of 7 HD cell lines, which could not be detected in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different levels of IL-6R protein were measured in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> cell lines: L428 and Dev cells were characterized by very low levels of gp80 and gp130, on KMH2 cells only gp130 but no gp80 was detected, whereas L540, L591, HDLM2, and L1236 were positive for both gp80 and gp130, suggesting a possible autocrine stimulation of STAT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a further increase in STAT3 activation on IL-6 or IL-6/soluble IL-6R stimulation was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6, gp80, gp130, or both receptor subunits did not affect the proliferation or the constitutive activation of STAT molecules in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> AG490 blocked the constitutive activation of STAT3 and inhibited spontaneous growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
