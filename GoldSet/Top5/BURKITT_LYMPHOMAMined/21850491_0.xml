<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possibility of 'redesigning the designer drug', separating desired anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> activity from unwanted psychoactivity and neurotoxicity, was therefore mooted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From an initial analysis of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="1391">MDMA</z:chebi> analogues synthesized with a modified Î±-substituent, it was found that incorporating a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl group</z:chebi> increased potency against sensitive, Bcl-2-deplete, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells 10-fold relative to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="1391">MDMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From this lead, related analogs were synthesized with the 'best' compounds (containing 1- and 2-naphthyl and para-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17097">biphenyl</z:chebi> substituents) some 100-fold more potent than <z:chebi fb="9" ids="1391">MDMA</z:chebi> versus the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When assessed against derived lines from a diversity of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="1391">MDMA</z:chebi> analogues were seen to impact the broad spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expressing a BCL2 transgene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells afforded only scant protection against the analogues and across the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> no significant correlation between constitutive Bcl-2 levels and sensitivity to compounds was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2-deplete cells displayed hallmarks of apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in response to the analogues while BCL2 overexpressing equivalents died in a caspase-3-independent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells expressing <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> transporters, their pharmacological blockade failed to reverse the anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> actions of the analogues studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither did reactive oxygen species account for ensuing cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Enhanced cytotoxic performance did however track with predicted lipophilicity amongst the designed compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="1391">MDMA</z:chebi> analogues have been discovered with enhanced cytotoxic efficacy against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes amongst which high-level Bcl-2--often a barrier to drug performance for this indication--fails to protect </plain></SENT>
