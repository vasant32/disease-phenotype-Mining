<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The gammac chain is a subunit of multiple cytokine receptors (interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15), the expression of which is restricted to hematopoietic lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A defect in gammac leads to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> characterized by a block in T cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to better characterize the human gammac promoter and define the minimal tissue-specific promoter region, progressive 5'-deletion constructs of a segment extending 1053 base pairs upstream of the major transcription start site were generated and tested for promoter activity in various hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The -1053/+34 construct allowed promoter activity only in cells of hematopoietic origin, and tissue specificity was conserved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other constructs tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The region downstream of -90 appeared critical for basal promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It contains two potential Ets binding sites conserved in the murine gammac promoter gene, one of which was found essential for functional promoter activity as determined by mutational analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The functional Ets binding site was found to bind Ets family proteins, principally GA-binding protein and Elf-1 and could be transactivated by GABPalpha and -beta synergistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that, as already reported for the IL2Rbeta promoter, GA-binding protein is an essential component of gammac basal promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although GABP expression is not restricted to the hematopoietic lineage, its interaction with other specific factors may contribute to the tissue-specific expression of the gammac gene </plain></SENT>
