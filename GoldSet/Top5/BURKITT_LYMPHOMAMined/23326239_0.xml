<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although EBV has been the focus of extensive research, much still remains unknown concerning what makes some individuals more sensitive to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and to adverse outcomes as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we use an integrative genomics approach in order to localize genetic factors influencing levels of Epstein Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) IgG antibodies, as a measure of history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with this pathogen, in large Mexican American families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide evidence of both significant linkage and association was obtained on chromosome 6 in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region and replicated in an independent Mexican American sample of large families (minimum p-value in combined analysis of both datasets is 1.4Ã—10(-15) for SNPs rs477515 and rs2516049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditional association analyses indicate the presence of at least two separate loci within MHC class II, and along with lymphocyte expression data suggest genes HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 as the best candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association signals are specific to EBV and are not found with IgG antibodies to 12 other pathogens examined, and therefore do not simply reveal a general HLA effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether SNPs significantly associated with diseases in which EBV is known or suspected to play a role (namely nasopharyngeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, and multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>) also show evidence of associated with EBNA-1 antibody levels, finding an overlap only for the HLA locus, but none elsewhere in the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significance of this work is that a major locus related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> has been identified, which may ultimately reveal the underlying mechanisms by which the immune system regulates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with this pathogen </plain></SENT>
