<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, EBV was associated with 39 of 59 (66%) HIV-related systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unlike the lymphoproliferations that arise in the setting of transplantation, the HIV-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were monoclonal, as evaluated by Ig heavy chain rearrangements and EBV termini analysis, and associated (40%) with c-MYC rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, analysis of multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissues from one autopsy showed evidence that a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> clone was responsible for dissemination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latent EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA-1) transcripts detected in the HIV-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were characteristic of the pattern found in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (g1 EBNA1) and not in transplant-related lymphoproliferations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, unlike Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, EBV latent membrane-associated protein (LMP) transcripts were also detected, thereby constituting an EBV expression pattern (g1 EBNA1+, LMP+) not previously observed in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate a high frequency of EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> that are distinct from the lymphoproliferations that arise during iatrogenic transplant-associated immuno-suppression or in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it is also apparent that HIV-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are biologically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, which may reflect the multiple mechanisms or steps necessary for eventual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
