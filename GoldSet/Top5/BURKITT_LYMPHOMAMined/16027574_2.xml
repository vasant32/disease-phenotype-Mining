<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Review of the medical records of children with mediastinal masses and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e> who were admitted to a multidisciplinary pediatric intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients with 12 life-threatening events were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five events (in 4 patients) occurred before hospital admission, and 3 patients had more than 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0003298'>choking</z:mp> episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients underwent cardiorespiratory resuscitation (2 before admission), and 2 underwent emergency endotracheal intubation because of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e>; the eighth patient could not be weaned off the ventilator until the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240318" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mediastinal mass</z:e> was resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median time from appearance of the initial symptoms to diagnosis was 8.5 days, and median time from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of alarming signs to admission was 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e> in children with an anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240318" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mediastinal mass</z:e> is not rare and can lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">complete obstruction</z:e>, requiring cardiorespiratory resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Physician awareness and preparedness for respiratory complications are essential for proper management of children with mediastinal masses </plain></SENT>
