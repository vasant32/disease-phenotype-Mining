<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the evidence linking EBV-infected cells and the GC is only indirect and limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a key portion of the model, that EBV-infected cells physically reside and participate in GCs, has yet to be verified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, recent experiments suggested that upon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of GC cells the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> growth latency transcription program is dominant and GC functionality and phenotype are ablated, i.e., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> is not consistent with GC function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we show that in vivo, EBV-infected B cells in the tonsils retain expression of functional and phenotypic markers of GC cells, including bcl-6 and AID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these cells are physically located in the GC and express a restricted form of latency, the default latency program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the EBV default latency transcription program, unlike the growth latency program, is consistent with the retention of GC functionality in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This work verifies key components of the GC model of EBV persistence and suggests that EBV and the GC can interact to produce the latently infected memory cells found in the periphery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it identifies latently infected GC B cells as a potential pathogenic nexus for the development of the EBV-positive, GC-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
