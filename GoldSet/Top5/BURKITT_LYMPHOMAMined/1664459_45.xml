<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the possible occurrence of EBV replication in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ARL) cells, we studied 13 cases by immunohistology using monoclonal antibodies to the EBV-encoded switch-protein BZLF1, early antigens (EAs), late replicative proteins [virus capsid antigens (VCAs) and membrane antigens (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="25427">MAs</z:chebi>)], and to the latent proteins EB nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA 2) and latent membrane protein (LMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBV genomes were detected by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBV genomes and/or gene products were demonstrated in ten cases, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> immunoblast-rich <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, two Burkitts <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and a T-cell anaplastic large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BZLF1 protein, which disrupts latency in B cells, was identified in six (60 per cent), and EAs in four (40 per cent) of the EBV-positive ARL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (10 per cent) expressed VCAs and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25427">MAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBNA 2 and LMP were detected in three (30 per cent) and eight (80 per cent) of EBV-positive cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBV DNA was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in 7 of 12 (58 per cent) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most important finding of this study was frequent spontaneous activation of latent EBV in ARL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Production of complete virus, however, was either aborted, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells expressing late productive cycle proteins (VCA, MA) were rapidly cleared from tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that host factors that normally inhibit replication of EBV are deficient in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
