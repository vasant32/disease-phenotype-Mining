<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunotoxins (IT) were synthesized by conjugating ricin (R) to four different monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) directed against distinct markers of T cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with anti-p67-R produced effective elimination of leukemic T cells from human marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> congener mafosfamid (ASTA Z 7577) markedly enhanced the target cell cytotoxicity of IT and extended the final level of clonogenic kill 2 to 3 logs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data show that anti-p67-R in combination with mafosfamid resulted in a maximum elimination of 6.2 logs of neoplastic T cells with minimal toxicity to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of this protocol was not reduced in the presence of excess <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were obtained by using a cocktail of four different anti-T cell IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This approach is unique in combining both immunologic (IT) and chemical (mafosfamid) strategies for more effective ex vivo bone marrow purging in autologous bone marrow transplantation for T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>/lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
