<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, how developmentally regulated changes are reflected in gene expression programs of lymphocyte differentiation is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that disregulation of transcription factors from the Ikaros family is associated with the development of different human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this work we analyzed the state of Ikaros family members in different leukemic cells with the aim to explore the transcriptional control of human hematopoietic lineages and shed some new light on our understanding of transcription factor significance in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By means of RT-PCR and specific primers we investigated the expression of Ikaros, Aiolos and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30217">Helios</z:chebi> transcription factors and their splicing variants in seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines derived from different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cell lines examined Ikaros was present in dominant Ik1 to Ik4 isoforms and small Ik6 isoform was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aiolos was expressed in the majority of the cell lines, of both, B and T origin, in the form of the full length Aio1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="30217">Helios</z:chebi> was also present only in two long isoforms Hel1 and Hel2, and was absent in one third of the lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar distribution of positive and negative expression of Aiolos and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30217">Helios</z:chebi> found in various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> could implicate common pathways of their regulation </plain></SENT>
