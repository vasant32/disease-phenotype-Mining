<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PBK/TOPK is a recently cloned serine/threonine kinase which is phosphorylated during mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Earlier work indicated that this kinase is upregulated in a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (GA-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether PBK/TOPK is upregulated in other mitotically active neoplastic cell lines and tissues, Northern analysis was performed on a panel of malignant cell lines and on clinical samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While PBK/TOPK <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was not detectable in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood cells and was weakly expressed in hyperplastic tonsillar B-cells, significantly higher levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were detected in 8 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, 10 other neoplastic cell lines, and 2 clinical samples-one derived from a patient with ALL and a second derived from a patient with relapsed <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, Northern analysis of fetal tissues showed upregulated expression of PBK/TOPK in fetal kidney, lung, spleen, brain, and testis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that PBK/TOPK expression is increased in highly proliferative malignant cells and during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fetal development </plain></SENT>
