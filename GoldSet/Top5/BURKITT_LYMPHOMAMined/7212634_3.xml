<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mammalian testicular organogenesis initiated by male specific but ubiquitously expressed H-Y antigen can serve as the model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other organogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in order to understand the precise organizational role this plasma membrane antigen plays, it is essential to characterize H-Y antigen as a distinct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23367">molecular entity</z:chebi> which would be extremely difficult if we have to deal directly with native H-Y antigen residing on the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, we have previously found that in the mutational absence of H-Y antigen's proposed anchorage site, B2m (-), HLA (-) Daudi human male Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells are incapable of stably maintaining H-Y antigen on their plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B2m (-), HLA (-) Daudi human male Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells excreted a group of several proteins that shared the three distinctive characteristics in common; their extreme hydrophobicity, their tendency beyond saturation to form irreversibly water insoluble aggregates by extensive interchain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bridges, and their conspicuously slower turn over rates compared to other Daudi excreted proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After disruption of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bridges, proteins of this group were resolved into at least seven distinct subunits of different molecular weights </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>M.W </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>18,000 subunit of testis-organizing H-Y antigen was the smallest of the above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the saturation, 0.7 to 0.9 microgram/ml of solubilized H-Y antigen uniformly assumed the form of very large aggregates of M.W. greater than 280,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In more dilute solutions, however, the existence in much smaller trimeric and tetrameric forms of H-Y antigen was indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As these irreversibly water insoluble precipitates still retained H-Y antigenic determinants, they can be used in the future for the purification of H-Y antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When bound specifically to H-Y receptor sites residing on the plasma membrane of BFO cells, polymeric Daudi H-Y antigen apparently underwent the depolymerization process, thus, yielding the monomeric form of M.W </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>18,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is likely that these six or more Daudi excreted proteins that shared the three distinct characteristics with testis-organizing H-Y antigen are also involved in various specific organogenesis </plain></SENT>
