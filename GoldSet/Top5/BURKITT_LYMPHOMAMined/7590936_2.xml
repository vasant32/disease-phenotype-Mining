<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To study the differentiation-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> two anti-i mAb producers, GL-1 and GL-2, were established from the combination of EBV-induced transformation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PBL and immune lysis of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi>-trapped liposome-containing bovine i-active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mAb GL-1 reacted with both sialosylparagloboside and pentahexosyl <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> and the bovine i-active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> whereas mAb GL-2 reacted only with the bovine i-active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> in LILA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both mAbs cold-agglutinate human cord red cells but not adult red cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, unexpectedly, the majority of the reactivity of these mAbs in human cord red cells on TLC was not identical to the i-active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The GL-1 antigenic substance is considered to be a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> distinct from the i-active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> because the immunoreactivity was canceled with endoglycoceramidase which cleaves a linkage between the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on complement cytolysis with the mAb, 15 hematopoietic cell lines and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral lymphocytes were screened for susceptibility to the mAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Ramos, was most sensitive among those tested, and BJA-B, Daudi, Namalwa in the B cell lines, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TALL</z:e>-1, Jurkatt in the T-cell lines and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 in the non-lymphoid cell lines were sensitive whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes or other 8 cell lines were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An immunoreactive spot with the same Rf with cord red cells was also detected in sensitive cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The possible presence of a new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> antigen determined from the mAb and related to the differentiation of hematopoietic cells was speculated </plain></SENT>
