<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Junctional sequences created by chromosomal translocations in mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, which involve immunoglobulin gene loci (IG) and putative proto-oncogenes on reciprocal partner chromosomes, are unique to neoplastic cells characterized by particular histological and immunological phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To establish a rapid and sensitive method to detect neoplastic cells carrying a specific chromosomal translocation, we have developed a novel strategy based on long-distance polymerase chain reaction (LD-PCR) amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells carrying t(14;19)(q32;q13), t(8;14)(q24;q32), t(3;22)(q27;q11), t(2;3)(p12;q27), or t(3;14)(q27;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two to 35-mer oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed to be complementary to exons or flanking sequences of the BCL3, c-MYC and BCL6 oncogenes, and to IG constant region genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LD-PCR with a newly available Taq polymerase for longer product synthesis successfully amplified fragments representing BCL3/C alpha junctional sequences for t(14;19); c-MYC/C mu, c-MYC/C gamma, and c-MYC/C alpha for t(8;14); BCL6/C lambda for t(3;22); BCL6/C kappa for t(2;3); 5'-BCL6/C mu, and 5'-BCL6/C gamma for t(3;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> materials in which c-MYC rearrangements were detectable by conventional Southern blot hybridization showed positive LD-PCR amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sizes of the amplified fragments varied from 1.8 kb to 12 kb, and these were specific to each material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serial dilution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells or DNA in negative materials demonstrated a single band on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4883">ethidium bromide</z:chebi> at a level of sensitivity of 10(-3), and hybridization with radioactive probe improved the level by one order of magnitude (1 cell in 10(4)), indicating that this LD-PCR approach is a sensitive technique capable of detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the present study provided a useful tool for diagnosis and subsequent management of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> characterized by specific chromosomal translocations </plain></SENT>
