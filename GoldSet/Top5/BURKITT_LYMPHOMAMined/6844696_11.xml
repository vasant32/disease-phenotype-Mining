<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to extend the usefulness of the quantitation of urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> markers, studies were undertaken to explore the adaptability of such determinations for early detection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-prone populations such as asbestos workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Another study was aimed at exploring the usefulness of therapy in individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During these studies, two heretofore unknown phenomena serendipitously emerged which expand the versatility of the marker determinations: (a) radiation damage in animals and humans causes an excretion of urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27389">BAIB</z:chebi> which from preliminary studies appears to be proportional to the irradiation burden, and (b) lead poisoning in the human also produces <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27389">BAIB</z:chebi> excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some of the practical uses of these determinations are self-evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 13 asbestos workers without clinical symptoms, eight were found to have significant elevations of the marker levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine asbestos workers with diagnosed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_365'>mesothelioma</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> excreted two or more markers at high levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some of the psi levels were the highest seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Currently the diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_365'>mesothelioma</z:mpath> is difficult and painful, requiring a rib resection; however, an asbestos worker with such elevations--provided small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the lung is ruled out--can be seriously suspected of having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_365'>mesothelioma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a study of the usefulness of the markers in following therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1135868" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">trophoblastic disease</z:e>, these markers were determined in women with incipient invasive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_456'>hydatidiform mole</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After curettage, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> markers indicated absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> but the usual marker, HCG, was still markedly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The women were followed up for 2 years and were found to remain symptom-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore the source of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> markers is cleared more rapidly than that of HCG </plain></SENT>
