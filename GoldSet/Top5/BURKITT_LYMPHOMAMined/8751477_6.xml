<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently established a new Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cell line, designated Z-33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This line has L2 <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, ultrastructural characteristics of lymphoblasts and typical B lineage surface markers identical to those observed in the Ph1-positive ALL patient from whom the line was derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, a rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (JH) band was found in Z-33 cells by Southern blot analysis, confirming B cell clonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of the cell line revealed t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified cDNA from Z-33 cells demonstrated an e1-az BCR-ABL junction, and the p190BCR-ABL protein was detected in them by the immune complex kinase assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Z-33 cells produce interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, Neither IL-1 beta, G-CSF, TNF-alpha, nor their corresponding antibodies affected the cell line's growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, anti-GM-CSF neutralizing antibodies suppressed Z-33 colony formation, and GM-CSF stimulated it in a dose-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, receptor studies with biotinylated GM-CSF demonstrated specific binding to Z-33 cells, indicating that the cells express GM-CSF receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data suggest that the Ph1-positive Z-33 ALL cells produce GM-CSF, express GM-CSF receptors, and show an autocrine proliferative response to this cytokine </plain></SENT>
