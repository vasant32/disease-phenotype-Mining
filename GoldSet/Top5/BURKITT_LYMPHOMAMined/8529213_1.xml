<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of the ITs (anti-CD19-dgA2 and anti-CD25-dgA2) had 3-0-fold improvements over their dgA1 counterparts in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the in vivo anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity of both constructs of each IT was the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, anti-CD22-dgA2 was 7-fold more potent in vitro and significantly more potent in vivo than its dgA1 counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that monoclonal antibodies must be individually tested to determine whether the addition of two versus one dgA will improve cytotoxic activity in vivo </plain></SENT>
