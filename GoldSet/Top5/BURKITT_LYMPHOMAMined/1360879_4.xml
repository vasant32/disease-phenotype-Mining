<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until now, however, the ability of HIV-1 to bind complement receptors has not been documented or characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether antibody and complement permitted HIV-1 to bind to the B lymphocyte receptor, CR2 (CD21), in an effort to learn more about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-enhancement, and also because CR2 can mediate B cell proliferation and antigen localization in lymphoid organs in other systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HIV-1 incubated with antibody and fresh human serum as a source of complement bound approximately 10-fold greater to cells expressing CR2 than to HIV-1-permissive cells lacking this receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A similar effect was observed using cells which expressed CR2 but no CD4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This binding was minimal in heat-inactivated and C3-deficient sera, and was significantly reduced by the anti-CR2 MoAb, OKB7, but not by the anti-CD4 MoAb, OKT4a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, complement and antibody acted in concert to facilitate the binding of HIV-1 to CR2 independently of CD4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD4-independent binding of HIV-1 to CR2 was not sufficient to produce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in Raji-3 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Titres of antibodies mediating CR2 binding correlated with antibody titres as measured by immunofluorescence (P &lt; 0.01) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-enhancement (P &lt; 0.05) but were discordant with titres of neutralizing antibodies, a result consistent with the utilization of CR2 for enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ability of complement and antibody to facilitate the binding of HIV-1 to CR2 in the absence of CD4 provides new insights into mechanisms of HIV-1-induced immunopathogenesis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-enhancement </plain></SENT>
