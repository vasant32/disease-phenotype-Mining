<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was done to analyze clinical and pathological features as well as the treatment outcome of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We carried out analysis of25 cases of primary gastrointestinal (GI) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> during period from March 2001 to February 2003 at Gujarat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> &amp; Research Institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Out of 25 cases of primary GI <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nine cases of gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nine cases of small intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and seven cases of large intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A male to female ratio of 2.6:1 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peak incidence was observed infirst and second decades of life (range 4-63 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>Abdominal pain</z:hpo> and abdominal lump were the two most common presenting symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell type and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were the most common histologic variants, accounting for equal proportions (36% each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were treated with either surgery alone or in combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy depending on the site, stage and histology </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>18 cases of GI <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were evaluable, and out of these, 66.6% (11 cases) attained complete remission with a median follow up time of 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The disease free survival was 50% (9 cases), and the overall survival was 72.2% (13 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although there are considerable therapeutic controversies, surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy yield good survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinical and histopathologic characteristics and prognosis of our cases with primary gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were usually similar to the cases in western countries with some differences in the incidence and histologic subtypes </plain></SENT>
