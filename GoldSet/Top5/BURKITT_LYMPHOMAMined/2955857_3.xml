<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi>, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) was used to examine the phenotypic changes in three African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, P3HR1, Daudi, and Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells were cultured with a nanogram concentration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> for up to seven days and then analyzed by flow cytometry and an immunoperoxidase staining method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells were stained with a panel of monoclonal antibodies reactive with B lymphocytes or B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and an antibody to the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Tdt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three cell lines were found to express more HLA-linked DC/DS (Leu 10) antigen, while demonstrating a concomitant decrease in the expression of common <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> antigen (CALLA) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase after <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other antigens including Ig, BA1, BA2, Tac, Leu 8, Leu 1, C3bR, Leu 12, and Leu M5 showed no significant changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The marker expression and differentiation pattern of these African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines are very similar to those of pre-B cells except for the surface IgM expression observed in Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of CALLA and Tdt in African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is probably not the result of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epstein-Barr virus infection</z:e>, but may in fact reflect the true nature or origin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells are derived from an early stage of B-cell differentiation closely related to, but more mature than pre-B cells </plain></SENT>
