<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a new liquid cell culture system for propagating Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells contaminating the bone marrow (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells at day 10 of culture is correlated with the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells in the initial sample, which permits the detection of as few as one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell in 10(6) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We currently use such an assay to detect minimal BM involvement in our patient's follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This has allowed to define in which clinical situations the BM collected for autologous transplantation (though cytologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) had to be "purged" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the help of this modified liquid system it was possible to quantify the efficacy of various purging procedures on different models; an experimental model of allogenic irradiated BM contaminated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-clinical assays were also conducted on our patients' BM contaminated with their own <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells, or on invaded BM collected for autologous transplantation and for which the system had evidenced the efficacy of the purging procedure </plain></SENT>
