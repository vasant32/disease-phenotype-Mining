<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) produced by Escherichia coli has been reported to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in many different cell types, including Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since it has been established that the caspases play essential roles as the effector molecules in the apoptotic process in most cases, we examined the kinetics of caspase activation during the process of Stx1-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using Ramos <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells that are highly sensitive to Stx1-mediated cytotoxicity, we observed that multiple caspases, including caspase-3, -7, and -8 were promptly activated following Stx1 treatment, as indicated by both the procaspase cleavages and enhancement of cleavage of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48030">tetrapeptide</z:chebi> substrates of the caspases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the inhibition assay revealed that caspase-8 is located upstream of both caspase-3 and -7, suggesting that Stx1-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> utilizes a similar caspase cascade to that involved in Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither anti-Fas mAb nor TNF-alpha, however, affected the Stx1-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the precise mechanism of Stx1-mediated activation of caspase-8 is still unclear, we have demonstrated that crosslinkage of CD77, a functional receptor for Stx1, with specific antibody is sufficient to induce activation of caspase-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings should provide new insight into the understanding of the molecular basis of Stx1-mediated cell injury </plain></SENT>
