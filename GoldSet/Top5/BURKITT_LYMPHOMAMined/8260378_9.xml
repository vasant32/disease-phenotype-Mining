<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This zone is demarcated by climatic requirements of temperature and rainfall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBV-activating plant factors are among several co-factors which have been proposed for the development of epidemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (eBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of Euphorbia tirucalli, a plant which possesses EBV-activating substances and can induce the characteristic 8:14 translocation of eBL in EBV-infected lymphoblastic cell lines in vitro, conforms closely to the climatic requirements of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This plant, other EBV-activating plants and plants of unknown EBV-activating status with medicinal uses, are found significantly more often at the homes of eBL patients in Malawi than in those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possible role of these plant factors in the pathogenesis of eBL and their routes of bodily access are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that the associations described in this paper provide support for the theory that EBV-activating plants are co-factors involved in the pathogenesis of some cases of eBL </plain></SENT>
