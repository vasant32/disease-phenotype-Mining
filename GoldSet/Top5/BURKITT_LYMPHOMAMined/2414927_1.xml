<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of the inducers producing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of 48-66% of Raji cells were determined to be: for dsRNA, 200 micrograms/ml; polyguacyl, 400 micrograms/ml; tiloron, 100 micrograms/ml; Tash-4, 200 micrograms/ml, which corresponded to the antiproliferative effect of 200 units/ml of alpha-interferon and 40 units/ml of gamma-interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No antiproliferative effect was observed at dsRNA, polyguacyl, and Tash-4 concentrations below 100 micrograms/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the inducers exerted the antiproliferative effect on the selected concentrations on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human diploid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results obtained explain the antitumorigenic effect of these inducers, demonstrated previously </plain></SENT>
