<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to explore relationship between pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and EDAG-1 through analyzing the structure of EDAG-1 coding region, and its expression in these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, HEL, K562, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60, Namalwa, Raji, J111, Jurkat, HuT 78, MEG-01, U937, 6T-CEM, HPB-ALL, KG-1a, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1, and DAMI, were selected to observe the expression of EDAG-1 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), EDAG-1 cDNA coding fragments (1.5 kb) were purified to construct the corresponding recombinant plasmid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, the plasmid was sequenced to analyze mutation of the coding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of EDAG-1 protein, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in these cell lines were detected by Western blot, and Northern blot; the rearrangement and amplification of EDAG-1 genome in these cell lines were detected by Southern blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EDAG-1 mRNA and protein were highly expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> cell lines (K-562, HEL), megakaryoblast <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines (DAMI, MEG-01), and T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line (Jurkat), while no gene mutation was found in coding region, no amplification and rearrangement of genome was detected in these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EDAG-1 was absent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cell line, and rearranged in HuT 78 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EDAG-1 may relate with pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> and megakaryoblast <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>; its coding region may have no relation with the mechanism of its activation </plain></SENT>
