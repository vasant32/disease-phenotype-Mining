<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice are particularly sensitive to irradiation which, in addition, can partially restore their immune system so that they are no longer totally immunologically incompetent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the past several years we have used nonirradiated <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice to grow human B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When we changed vendors, we found it necessary to irradiate the mice before xenografting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sublethal irradiation of at least one source of <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell inoculation improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> take and dissemination, but irradiation changed the response of these mice to chemotherapy and immunotoxins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus the irradiated mice did not respond to chemotherapy, but the two immunotoxins used for therapy became more effective in extending survival of the mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It then appears that irradiation affects the immune system of <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice in such a way as to change their response to the therapeutic regimens used here </plain></SENT>
