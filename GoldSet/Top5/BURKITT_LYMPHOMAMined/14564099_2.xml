<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is one of the most aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in the human body, and in the past the prognosis was very poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, complex chemotherapy regimens can now cure approximately 50-80% of adult patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or small noncleaved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and in pediatric populations the cure rate is even higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the African type has a preference to the head and neck region (whereas the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> type to the abdomen), involvement of the base of the tongue is extremely rare as only 1 case has ever been reported in the English literature </plain></SENT>
