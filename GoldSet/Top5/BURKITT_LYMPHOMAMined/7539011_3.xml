<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow is the primary site of disease in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) and is frequently involved in patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the time of autologous bone marrow transplantation, marrow grafts from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are often still contaminated by malignant cells, even when such patients achieve complete clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the potential of anti-B4-blocked-ricin (anti-B4-bR) immunotoxin to eliminate residual ALL and NHL cells from bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-B4-bR binds to the CD19 antigen, which is B-lineage specific, and, at concentrations of 5 x 10(-9) M or greater, could eliminate more than 3 logs of CD19+ Nalm-6 or Namalwa cells in a 20-fold excess of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> irradiated bone marrow after only 5 hr of incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This activity was abrogated by the addition of anti-B4 but not by the presence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi>, which is the natural ligand for native ricin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, when used at these high concentrations, anti-B4-bR showed little nonspecific toxicity against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a single short exposure to anti-B4-bR is capable of inducing high levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CD19+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells without significant nonspecific toxicity against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, anti-B4-bR offers an interesting approach to the elimination of B-lineage malignant cells prior to autologous bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
