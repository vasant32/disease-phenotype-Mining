<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The goals of the current study were to examine the incidence and severity of toxicity resulting from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> during induction therapy for children with precursor B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) and to determine whether the addition of daunomycin affected toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records of patients with precursor B-cell ALL from January 1996 through June 2000 were reviewed retrospectively for toxicity during the 4-week induction phase and the 2 weeks after the induction phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred seventy-six patients age &lt; 14 years were diagnosed with precursor B-cell ALL from January 1996 through June 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 156 evaluable patients, 106 were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and 50 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two patients received steroids, L-asparaginase, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, whereas 104 high-risk patients received daunomycin in addition to these 3 agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> was significantly higher among patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (P = 0.01); incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> were similar for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">Dexamethasone</z:chebi> led to more <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> than did <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (+11.9% vs. +5.4%; P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were observed in 27 (25.5%) and 18 (36%) patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, respectively (P &lt; or = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients, four of whom received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and one of whom received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The addition of daunomycin to treatment regimens increased overall toxicity (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When daunomycin was included in treatment regimens, toxicity was greater among patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>; in contrast, when daunomycin was not included, toxicity was equal for both treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regardless of daunomycin use, there was no difference in the incidence of serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ALL treatment was not compromised by steroid-related toxicity in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of daunomycin led to a much larger increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>-related toxicity compared with the increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>-related toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although the use of daunomycin enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>-related toxicity, this enhancement did not result in a higher mortality rate or the alteration of planned ALL therapy </plain></SENT>
