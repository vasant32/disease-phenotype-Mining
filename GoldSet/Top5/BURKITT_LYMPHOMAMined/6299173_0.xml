<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Total lysates of the EBV-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines Ramos and BJAB were compared with their permanently converted EBV-genome positive sublines, after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>-methionine labelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five out of seven EBV-infected lines showed a 68k protein, which was absent from both EBV-free parental lines, and was identified as a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (gp 68) by metabolic sugar labelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that presence of this protein is a direct or indirect consequence of the presence of the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
