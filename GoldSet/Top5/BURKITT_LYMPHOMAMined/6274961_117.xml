<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two new cell surface antigens expressed on B lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) were defined with cytotoxic mouse monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One marker, BB-1 (for B lymphoblast antigen-1), was detected on human and nonhuman primate B-LCL, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-activated B cell blasts, most Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and Ia+ B lymphoblast-like <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myelomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polyclonal B cell activators such as pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> (PWM) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) also induced the expression of BB-1 on immunoglobulin (Ig)-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, BB-1 could not be detected on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissues by complement-dependent cytotoxicity and immunofluorescence (IF) assays or by analysis with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T cell blasts, T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, and pre-B cell or erythroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines were also BB-1 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest was the finding that BB-1 was expressed on the Jijoye <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but only marginally on a subline of Jijoye, P3HR-1, that lacks receptors for EBV and produces a defective virus incapable of transforming lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A second lymphoblast antigen (LB-1) unlike BB-1, was present on both T and B cell blasts and virus-transformed T- and B-LCL but not on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
