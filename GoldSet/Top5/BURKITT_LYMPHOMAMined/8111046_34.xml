<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After allogeneic HLA-identical BMT, donor-derived cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) directed at minor histocompatibility (mH) antigens on the recipients, tissues can be shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the antileukemic reactivity of mH antigen-specific CTLs, we analyzed the expression of mH antigens on circulating lymphocytic and myeloid leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that the defined mH specificities HA-1 through HA-5 and H-Y are present on leukemic cells, indicating that mH antigen-specific CTLs are capable of HLA class I-restricted antigen-specific lysis of leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with interleukin-2-stimulated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes, leukemic cells of lymphocytic origin are less susceptible to T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity by the HA-2 mH antigen-specific CTL and the anti-HLA-A2 CTL clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation for this phenomenon is impaired expression of the LFA-1 adhesion molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that mH antigen-specific HLA class I-restricted CD8+ CTLs may be involved in the graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> reactivity after allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
