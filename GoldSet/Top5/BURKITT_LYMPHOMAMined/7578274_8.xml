<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In cells, the casein kinase II beta-subunit is phosphorylated at an autophosphorylation site and at a site (Ser-209) that is maximally phosphorylated in mitotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify protein kinase activities that phosphorylate Ser-209, we fractionated extracts from mitosis-arrested human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> MANCA cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single Ser-209 kinase activity was detected following each fractionation step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Ser-209 kinase was purified to a specific activity of approx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>250 nmol/min per mg and efficiently phosphorylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H1, a synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> containing Ser-209 (Ser-209 peptide), myelin basic protein and casein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fractions containing Ser-209 kinase activity contained p34cdc2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of the Ser-209 kinase activity with p13suc1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> and anti-p34cdc2 antiserum demonstrated conclusively that the isolated Ser-209 kinase is p34cdc2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies provide strong biochemical evidence that p34cdc2 is the enzyme that phosphorylates Ser-209 on the beta-subunit of CKII in mitotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, these results indicate that the Ser-209 peptide can be utilized as a specific reagent for the assay of p34cdc2 activity in mitotic extracts, since no other Ser-209 peptide kinase activities were detected </plain></SENT>
