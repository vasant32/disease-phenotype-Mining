<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, although two cell surface receptors for TNF have been identified, and their cDNAs cloned, the amino acid residues necessary for the biological activity of TNF have not been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have therefore constructed derivatives of TNF termed 'muteins', in which the first 3 to 7 amino acids of native TNF-alpha have been replaced, using synthetic cDNA expressed in E. coli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study we compare the effects of native TNF-alpha and muteins III, IV, V and VI in several different in vitro systems and in one in vivo model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed binding to the p75 TNF receptor on Jijoye Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with native TNF-alpha and mutein III alone, whereas the p55 TNF receptor on the human epithelioid <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line HeLa bound TNF-alpha, mutein III and mutein V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Muteins IV and VI failed to recognize either TNF receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WEHI 164 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100244'>fibrosarcoma</z:hpo> cells were killed by muteins III, V and VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells responded to native TNF-alpha and to muteins III, IV and V, but not to mutein VI, by increasing the surface expression of ICAM-1 antigen and secretion of the cytokines GM-CSF and IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four compounds were pro-inflammatory in a mouse in vivo model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results presented in this report confirm that N-terminal amino acids are critical for both receptor binding and biological activity of TNF-alpha.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
