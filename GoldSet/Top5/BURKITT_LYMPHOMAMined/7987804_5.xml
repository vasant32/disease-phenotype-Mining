<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the relation between the level of recombinase activating gene (RAG-1) and the methylation status of T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta-chain gene in TCR-beta rearrangement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo>, including 21 patients with B-precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) and 23 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rearrangement of the TCR beta-chain gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> always occurs at the allele that contains hypomethylated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi>- <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> (CCGG) sequences within either the TCR-J beta 1 or TCR-J beta 2 regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-precursor ALL patients with TCR-beta rearrangement had hypomethylated TCR-beta with or without the presence of RAG-1 activity detectable by reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction, whereas none of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with TCR-beta rearrangement and hypomethylated TCR-beta had detectable RAG-1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some ALL patients had hypomethylated TCR-beta and RAG-1 activity without TCR-beta rearrangement, and most of them showed t(4;11)(q21;q23) or t(9;22)(q34;q11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate a correlation between the hypomethylation status of the TCR-beta and its rearrangements, but some unknown blockage factor for this association exists in B-precursor ALL patients with specific chromosomal translocations </plain></SENT>
