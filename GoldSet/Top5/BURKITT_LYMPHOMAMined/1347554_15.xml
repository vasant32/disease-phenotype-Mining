<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we demonstrate that IL-4 specifically induces germ-line epsilon transcripts in most EBV lymphoblastoid (LCL) and EBV+ and EBV- Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells without inducing IgE synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, cocultivation of cloned sIgM+, sIgE- EBV-LCL or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells with activated CD4+ T cell clones in the presence of IL-4 resulted in IgE production in 13 to 24% of the wells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of rearranged DNA in IgE-producing cloned <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells indicated that epsilon switching occurred through a recombination deletion event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgE production is a stable feature of the cloned switched EBV-LCL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells because these cells continued to produce relatively high levels of IgE in the absence of IL-4 and CD4+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction of IgE synthesis was blocked by IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), but only TGF-beta inhibited IL-4-induced germ-line epsilon <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of TGF-beta are mediated via inhibition of germ-line epsilon expression, whereas IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma block other steps in the regulatory processes resulting in induction of IgE synthesis by established human B cell line cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the same set of signals that induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells to switch to IgE synthesis also induce high frequency epsilon switching in cloned established EBV transformed and malignant B cell lines including classical cell lines such as JY and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-2 </plain></SENT>
