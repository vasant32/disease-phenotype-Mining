<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Somatic hypermutation (SHM) targets primarily the immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) genes in germinal center (GC) B cells, thereby allowing antibody affinity maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A malfunction of SHM, termed aberrant somatic hypermutation (ASHM), was found in about 50% of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>), leading to mutations in the 5' sequences of multiple genes, including oncogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the SHM mechanism is largely unknown, it was shown to require the activation-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase (AID) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AID <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is expressed in GC B cells and GC-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but the pattern of expression of the AID protein is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using 2 specific antibodies, here we show that the AID protein can be detected in GC centroblasts and their transformed counterpart (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) but not in pre-GC B cells and post-GC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, including B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> displayed variable levels of AID expression, which did not correlate with IgV ongoing hypermutation, ASHM, or disease subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, both in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant B cells the AID protein appeared predominantly localized in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the AID protein is specifically expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and transformed GC B cells; nonetheless, its predominantly cytoplasmic localization suggests that additional mechanisms may regulate its function and may be altered during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
