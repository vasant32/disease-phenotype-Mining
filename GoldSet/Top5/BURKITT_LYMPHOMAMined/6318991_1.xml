<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this effect did not appear to be due to inhibition of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis since the concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> required to inhibit EBV-early antigen induction was 50- to 100-fold higher than that normally required for the inhibition of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
