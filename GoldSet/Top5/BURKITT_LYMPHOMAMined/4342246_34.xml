<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The somatic cell hybrids were negative when examined for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the hybrid cells were exposed to 5-iododeoxyuridine, both EBV-specific antigens and virus particles were induced as determined by the immunofluorescence test and by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data presented suggest that the EBV genome can be transferred from a lymphoblastoid cell to another cell type during cell hybridization, that the EBV genome can persist in the hybrid cells for long periods of time, and that synthesis of the virus can be induced in the heterokaryons </plain></SENT>
