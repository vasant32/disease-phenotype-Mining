<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We established the HHV-6-positive, Epstein-Barr virus-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Katata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the status of the HHV-6 genome in Katata cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neither linear nor circular HHV-6 DNA was detected by Gardella gel analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fluorescence in situ hybridization technique enabled us to directly visualize the integrated HHV-6 DNA at the single-cell level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one integrated site of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA was detected in metaphase chromosomes and it was preferentially located at the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the cells with 12-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="45127">phorbol-13-acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) or with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 led to induction of the HHV-6 immediate-early gene as well as the late gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> also gave rise to expression of the HHV-6 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> inducibility was synergistically enhanced when combined with A23187 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study provides, for the first time, an in vitro model system of latent HHV-6 infection whose genome is integrated into host DNA of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
