<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cellular system offers the advantage that MHC class II induction is studied in a "physiologic" cell lineage that, as a result of this expression within the thymus, is thought to participate to the selection and maturation of the T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that the MHC class II gene expression was associated with the de novo transcription of the gene encoding the CIITA trans-activator, a crucial MHC class II gene regulatory factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of interaction between the MHC class II DRA promoter and corresponding binding factors was analyzed by in vivo DNAse I footprint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that treatment with IFN-gamma induces changes in the occupancy of the DRA gene regulatory sequences by nuclear factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The resulting occupancy displays strong similarities with the one observed in the MHC class II-constitutive B cells, represented by both the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line Raji and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tonsil- derived B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, some peculiar differences were observed between the TEC, either IFN-gamma-induced or not, and the constitutive B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that both common mechanisms, such as the one mediated by the CIITA trans-activator, and distinct tissue-specific constraints contribute to the transcriptional control of constitutive and IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II gene expression </plain></SENT>
