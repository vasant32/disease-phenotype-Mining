<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) isolates can be classified as type A or type B depending upon the identity of their EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) 2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The great majority of isolates examined to date encode an EBNA 2A protein like that of the reference type A strain B95-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type B virus strains, encoding an antigenically distinct EBNA 2B protein, have as yet only been rescued from rare Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines of African origin (Jijoye, AG876) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our recent finding that type B isolates are less efficient than type A in in vitro transformation assays prompted us to determine (i) the relative contribution the two types of virus make to the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in endemic areas of Africa (Kenya) and New Guinea and (ii) the relative incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with these two types in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population in these same areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the first point, EBNA 2 gene typing using specific DNA probes showed that four of ten recently established Kenyan <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines and two of four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines from New Guinea carried type B virus isolates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To address the second point, spontaneous lymphoblastoid cell lines were established from the blood of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> virus carriers and typed for EBNA 2 at the protein level; a significant proportion (greater than 20%) of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population in both the above <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-endemic areas were infected with type B isolates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first indication of the widespread nature of type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037140" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">B virus infection</z:e> in any community and the first isolation of such viruses from a non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reproducible size of the EBNA 2B protein encoded by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> type B isolates irrespective of their geographical origin, and of the EBNA 1 protein encoded by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> type B isolates from one area, contrasted markedly with the extreme variability in the size both of EBNA 2A and of EBNA 1 seen generally among type A isolates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the number of type B virus strains in existence worldwide could be quite limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, the data suggest that type B viruses, despite their relatively poor performance in in vitro transformation assays, can contribute at least as efficiently as can type A viruses to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
