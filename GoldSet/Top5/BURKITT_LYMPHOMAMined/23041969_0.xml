<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report synthesis of a family of self-assembled polymer-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> nanoparticles and an evaluation of the effects of various types of side-chains on intracellular uptake and cytotoxicity of the nanocarriers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monomers with three different cationic side-chains (CA) and pK(a)'s, i.e., a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30087">guanidinium</z:chebi> group (Ag), an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="14434,16069">imidazole</z:chebi> group (Im), and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51146">tertiary amine group</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Dm</z:e>), were comparatively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cationic monomer, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46793">poly(ethylene glycol)</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (Dox) were reacted with 1,4-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52684">butanediol</z:chebi>) diacrylate (BUDA) to prepare a poly(Î²-amino <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi>) (PBAE) polymer via Michael addition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three polymer-Dox conjugates spontaneously formed nanoparticles (NP) through hydrophobic interactions between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> in aqueous solution, resulting in NP-Im/Dox, NP-Ag/Dox, and NP-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Dm</z:e>/Dox, with hydrodynamic sizes below 80 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">Doxorubicin</z:chebi> was linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 types of NPs with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38532">hydrazone</z:chebi> bond to assure selective release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> only at acidic pH, as it occurs in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both NP-Im/Dox and NP-Ag/Dox exhibited much higher intracellular uptake by Ramos cells (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) than NP-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Dm</z:e>/Dox, suggesting that the type of side chain in the NPs determines the extent of intracellular uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result, NP-Im/Dox and NP-Ag/Dox showed cytotoxicity that was comparable to free Dox in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the nature of surface cationic group on nanocarriers may profoundly influence their intracellular trafficking and resulting therapeutic efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is a crucial factor to be considered in the design of novel carriers for intracellular drug delivery </plain></SENT>
