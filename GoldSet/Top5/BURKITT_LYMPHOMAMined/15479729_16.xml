<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of TIMP-1 correlates with aggressive clinical behavior of a spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, for the first time, we address the role of TIMP-1 in the pathogenesis of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line with ectopic TIMP-1 expression (TIMP-1JD38) was used to identify genes induced/repressed by TIMP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differentially expressed genes were analyzed by cDNA microarray, and they were validated by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis revealed changes of genes coding for B-cell growth/differentiation, transcription, and cell cycle regulators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TIMP-1 repressed expression of germinal center (GC) markers CD10, Bcl-6, PAX-5 and up-regulated plasma cell-associated antigens CD138, MUM-1/IRF-4, XBP-1, and CD44, suggesting a plasma cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is accompanied by activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3) and switch to cyclin D2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, TIMP-1JD38 cells expressed an inactive form of XBP-1, lacking antibody production/secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This incomplete plasmacytic differentiation occurs without altering cell proliferation, and despite c-Myc deregulation, indicating an arrested plasmacytic/plasmablastic stage of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further validation in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and in primary B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> demonstrated a predominant TIMP-1 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with plasmacytic/plasmablastic phenotypes, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myelomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly support TIMP-1 as an important factor in the pathogenesis of plasmacytic/plasmablastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
