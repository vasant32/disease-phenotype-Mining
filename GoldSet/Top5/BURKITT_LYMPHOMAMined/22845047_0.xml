<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both occur in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), but many cases lack either abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression patterns of the TP53 inhibitor MDM4 have not been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, and increased MDM4 could deregulate the TP53 pathway in cases without TP53 or MDM2 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated TP53 pathway disruption in paediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patient samples (n = 30) by studying MDM4, MDM2, and CDKN1A (p21) protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression; TP53 mutations; TP53 protein expression; and gene copy number abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MDM4 protein was expressed in 30/30 tumours, and MDM2 protein was weakly expressed in 7/30 (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were negative for CDKN1A protein, and CDKN1A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TP53 mutations were detected in 5/28 (18%) cases and confirmed by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TP53 protein was expressed in 15/30 (50%) cases, including 7/8 with TP53 genetic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MDM2 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels did not correlate with lack of TP53 genetic changes or TP53 protein expression; however, there was an inverse relationship between detectable TP53 protein expression and MDM4 copy number gains and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The TP53 pathway is deregulated in paediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases, and increased MDM4 expression may be the primary mechanism in some cases </plain></SENT>
