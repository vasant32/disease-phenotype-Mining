<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With the use of a needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> technique for obtaining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> material, the direct karyotype of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was examined from 15 Ghanaian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 14q+ chromosome (in addition to other chromosomal abnormalities) was present in 8 (57%) of the 14 patients; 6 of these 8 patients had t(8;14) (q24;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the remaining 2 patients had a #8 chromosome deleted, whereas the second had 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing #8 chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other numerical and structural abnormalities were frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation between type or frequency of abnormality and clinical status or survival was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within cells of the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> aspirate, the karyotype abnormalities were generally similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, karyotypes from two separate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sites (abdomen-bone marrow, 2 cases; right maxilla-left mandible, 1 case) showed identical markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same marker was seen in specimens from the initial and second relapse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">abdominal tumors</z:e> of 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The similarity of chromosomal markers from two sites or in serial studies further supports the concept that African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a disease of monoclonal origin </plain></SENT>
