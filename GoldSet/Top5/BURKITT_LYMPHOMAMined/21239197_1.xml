<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequent to initial reports, the clinical and pathological spectrum of this disease has been expanded such that, now, PBL is recognized to be a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disease entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasmablastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has been seen in clinical settings outside those initially reported and has been shown to demonstrate a variety of morphologic patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of extraoral PBL in an human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus-infected patient with a computed tomography-identified heterogeneously enhancing mass in the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologically, a prominent intravascular component was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis for MYC/IGH (immunoglobulin heavy chain) rearrangement t(8;14) identified fusion signals, confirming the presence of MYC rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of a prominent intravascular in our case is unique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, these findings have not been observed in the previous reports of PBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observation of this vascular component supports the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of PBL and may be an indicator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We were able to demonstrate the MYC/IGH rearrangement in our case of PBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The interplay between Epstein-Barr virus and this MYC rearrangement may be similar to what is observed in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, another clinically aggressive non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
