<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 138-kDa nuclear protein was identified from HeLa cell extracts as a factor which binds to a previously described 20-base pair cis element located in the intron I of the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This myc intron factor (MIF) binds to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> c-myc sequence but does not bind under similar conditions to c-myc from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> which contain point mutations in this binding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that the 138-kDa MIF is a phosphoprotein and that treatment of the purified MIF with potato acid phosphatase abolished binding to its 20-base pair c-myc recognition sequence; binding activity was protected by inclusion of phosphatase inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that phosphorylation is required for the specific DNA-MIF interaction in vitro and that the phosphorylation state of MIF may be an important factor in controlling c-myc expression in vivo </plain></SENT>
