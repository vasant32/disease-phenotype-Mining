<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 29 patients with American Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who underwent sonography, 10 were found to have renal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 10 patients demonstrated a range of abnormalities, notably renomegaly (nine patients), diffuse increase in cortical echogenicity (six), and focal renal masses (three) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The focal infiltrations were, unexplicably, hypoechoic in two patients and hyperechoic in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000126'>Hydronephrosis</z:hpo> was seen in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had evidence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9679">calcium phosphate</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000787'>renal stones</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response to therapy can be assessed by changes in renal size and cortical echogenicity, as well as disappearance of focal lesions </plain></SENT>
