<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Homozygous MTS1 deletions were found in 20 of 24 T-ALL cases and in only 2 of 31 B-lineage cases (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deletions involved MTS1 and MTS2 in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Homozygous MTS2 deletions were observed in 16 of 24 T-ALL cases and in 1 of 31 B-lineage ALLs (P &lt; .001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them displaying homozygous MTS1 deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 5 cases (4 T and 1 B), deletions involved MTS1 but spared the MTS2 gene, showing that one deletion breakpoint was located between the two genes within a 25-kb region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 1 T-ALL case, an MTS1 gene rearrangement has occurred downstream to exon 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Possible hemizygous deletions were found in 6 cases, 4 of them of the B-cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 7 ALL cases, cells obtained at presentation and at first relapse were studied and identical results were observed in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 1 B-lineage case, a germline pattern was found at presentation and a possible monoallelic MTS1/MTS2 deletion was observed at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of MTS1 and MTS2 homozygous deletions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALLs</z:e> supports the view that inactivation of these genes plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this type of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
