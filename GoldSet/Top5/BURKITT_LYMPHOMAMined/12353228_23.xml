<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is located on 1p36, a region frequently deleted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the pattern of inactivation of this gene in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, we studied 59 tumors to identify abnormal methylation in exon 1 and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p73 was methylated in 13/50 (26%) B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of p73 methylation in the 9 T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed the highest proportion of methylated cases (36%), although this alteration also affected other aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> such as diffuse large cell and some marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LOH at the p73 locus was detected in 4/34 (11%) B and 1/9 (11%) T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The p73 expression analysis showed absence or low level of p73 product in methylated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, whereas p73 was always detected in unmethylated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found monoallelic expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood samples, consistent with imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showed LOH and methylation of the remaining allele simultaneously, suggesting that alteration of the expressed allele could lead to the total inactivation of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results show that deletion or methylation of the p73 gene could be important mechanisms in suppressing p73 expression in B cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
