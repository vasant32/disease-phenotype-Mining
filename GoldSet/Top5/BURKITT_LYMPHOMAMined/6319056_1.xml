<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with corresponding data of an African control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As revealed by indirect immunofluorescence techniques, the patients displayed a pattern of IgG and IgA antibodies to EB virus associated antigens which is characteristic for these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant differences could be detected between the total IgG levels of the diagnostic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean total IgG concentrations of our Kenyan patients were two to three times as high as those found in four different groups of Europeans, which is consistent with results of previous studies on Gambian, Nigerian, and Congolese Bantu populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative determination of the four IgG subclasses by radial immunodiffusion revealed a unique pattern in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> group which was characterized by a decreased proportion of IgG2 and significantly lower absolute IgG2 values as compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IgG subclass distribution pattern in the African NPC sera was essentially identical with that of European NPC and African control sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathogenetic implications of these findings are discussed </plain></SENT>
