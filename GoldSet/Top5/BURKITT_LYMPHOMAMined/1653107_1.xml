<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Then, a model experiment aimed at chemical characterization of such active substances was carried out using a soil-extract around Sapium sebiferum, a Japanese representative Euphorbiaceae plant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromatographic separation guided by the EBV early antigen (EA) inducing activity gave a highly active fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Application of this fraction to desorption chemical ionization mass spectrometry identified a major active substance to be 12-O-hexadecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>), which originally occurs in this plant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The method in this model experiment is suggested to be applicable to other samples from the endemic areas of NPC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
