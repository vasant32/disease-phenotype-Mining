<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17478">aldehydes</z:chebi> such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17169">benzaldehyde</z:chebi>, 2-furaldehyde, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27909">paraldehyde</z:chebi> were found to induce formation of stable DNA-protein cross-links (DPXs) in cultured human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A relationship between increased cytotoxicity and DPX formation was observed with each <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="27909">Paraldehyde</z:chebi> was the most potent cross-linking <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi> studied, yet least cytotoxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although DPX formation by aliphatic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17478">aldehydes</z:chebi> is well-known, this study confirms the potential for cyclic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17478">aldehydes</z:chebi> to cause formation of DPXs in cultured cells at therapeutically relevant doses </plain></SENT>
