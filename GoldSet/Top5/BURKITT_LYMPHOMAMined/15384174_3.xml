<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The fragile histidine triad (FHIT) gene, a potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene, is frequently inactivated in multiple human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the FHIT gene remains largely unexplored in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, we assessed whether loss of FHIT expression occurs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, and, if so, what is the mechanism of such loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lack of protein expression was observed in 50% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) showed that 45% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines carried aberrantly methylated FHIT alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-treated DNA confirmed these data and indicated a very high density of methylation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> methylated alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Real-time, quantitative reverse-transcription PCR analysis indicated that attenuation of full-length FHIT transcription was correlated with methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of transcripts illustrated that aberrant transcription resulting in loss of FHIT exons occurred more commonly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> containing unmethylated FHIT genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, such transcripts often coexisted with full-length FHIT transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Not surprisingly, therefore, loss of FHIT protein in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> correlated with CpG island methylation, rather than with aberrant transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FHIT methylation also was detected in 31% (16 of 51) of the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> examined, including 2 samples whose derived cell lines also manifested FHIT hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Aberrant methylation can thus occur in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In summary, this report provides evidence that epigenetic modification frequently results in loss of FHIT expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
