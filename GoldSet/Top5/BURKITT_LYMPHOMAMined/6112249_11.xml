<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>SASP, the drug most widely used for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, is a competitive inhibitor of intestinal <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> metabolism and transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of the therapeutic effects of the drug could be related to antifolate actions on lymphocytes, which predominate in the inflammatory reaction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experiments were designed to examine the effect of SASP on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-dependent systems in cultured lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In rat spleen lymphocytes, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="20506,26911">THF</z:chebi>-dependent conversion of glycine to serine was inhibited by SASP, with 50% inhibition occurring at 0.1 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further evidence of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> antagonism was obtained with the dU suppression test, which depends on the function of a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-dependent pathway in the de novo synthesis of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">Folate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> reduces the incorporation of dU into DNA and thus favors incorporation of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> into DNA by an alternate pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SASP inhibited the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-dependent pathway in proliferating virally transformed human lymphocytes (Raji cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To confirm that SASP acts as a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> in this system, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="20506,26911">THF</z:chebi> was demonstrated to partly reverse the action of SASP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The significance of this antifolate action by SASP in intact lymphocytes deserves further study in relation to the actions of SASP in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
