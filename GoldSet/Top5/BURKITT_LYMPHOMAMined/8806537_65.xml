<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">Tetracycline</z:chebi>-regulated vectors were used to obtain inducible expression in stable transfected B cell lines of two Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent genes, LMP1 and EBNA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transfected genes were tightly repressed by low, nontoxic concentrations of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> (&lt; or = 1 microgram/ml) and, following removal of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>, were induced to levels comparable to or up to 3x that of EBV-transformed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In transfected DG75 cells, induced expression of LMP1, but not of EBNA2, led to the expected upregulation of various cell surface markers, including: CD40, CD54, CD58, and HLA class I.A novel observation was that both LMP1 and EBNA2 independently caused the downregulation of surface IgM, an effect mirrored in EBV-positive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines undergoing phenotypic drift during the transition from latency I to latency III in which both LMP1 and EBNA2 are upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most remarkably, induced LMP1 expression almost completely inhibited cell growth for 4 to 5 days, after which the cells recovered a limited proliferative capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> effect of LMP1 was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three B cell lines studied: DG75, BJAB, and Akata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further analysis showed that induction of LMP1 coincided with a reduction in the levels of c-myc, and that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> effect was due to an accumulation of cells at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a novel function for the LMP1 oncogene in controlling the proliferation of EBV-infected cells by regulating progress through G2/M phase </plain></SENT>
