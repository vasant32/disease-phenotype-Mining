<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The national registry-based case-control study ESCALE was carried out in France over the period 2003-2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Population controls were frequency matched with the cases on age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maternal smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy and paternal smoking since before conception were reported by the mothers in a structured telephone questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) were estimated using unconditional regression models closely adjusted for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 765 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL), 130 of Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>), 165 of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and 1681 controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Paternal smoking was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> (OR = 1.4 [1.1-1.7]), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (OR = 1.5 [1.0-2.3]), Burkitt (OR = 2.0 [1.2-3.2]), and anaplastic large cell (OR = 3.2 [1.2-9.1]) NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the four diseases, the ORs significantly increased with the number of cigarettes smoked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> or with other types of NHL was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The associations with maternal alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking during pregnancy were less consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results support the hypothesis that only paternal smoking, and not maternal alcohol consumption or cigarette smoking, plays a role in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
