<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A His-tagged coiled coil stem loop <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> containing a tridecapeptide (TDP) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> (GFLGEDPGFFNVE) in the loop region (CCSL-TDP) was designed and synthesized genetically by expressing an artificial gene in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surfaces containing self-assembled CCSL-TDP <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were prepared by first covalently grafting poly(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53440">HPMA</z:chebi>-co-MABNTA-co-MABP) onto <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> (PS) surface by UV irradiation, then charging the surface with <z:chebi fb="152" ids="28112">nickel</z:chebi> through <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39054">NTA</z:chebi> groups, and finally attaching the CCSL-TDP <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> through Ni-histidine chelation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The modified PS surfaces with and without self-assembled CCSL-TDP <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell attachment studies with human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji B cells showed that the cells selectively bound to the self-assembled CCSL-TDP <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> surfaces, but not to the surfaces of PS, PS with grafted <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi>, and PS with grafted <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi> and self-assembled coiled coil <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> with similar structure but without the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the cell attachment was mediated by the CCSL-TDP <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, most probably by the TDP <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CCSL <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> self-assembly presented here may represent a feasible model of exposing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> for biorecognition studies </plain></SENT>
