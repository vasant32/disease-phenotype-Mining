<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBNA-1 binds in a site-specific manner to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA and is essential for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication, as well as for maintaining the genome as an extrachromosomal episome within infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBNA-1 is not recognized by the cellular immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that, in addition to its known DNA binding properties, EBNA-1 can also act as a strong <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> binding protein, interacting with diverse substrates in vitro, including the EBV-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase III transcript EBER1 and the HIV-encoded transactivation response (TAR) element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also show that EBNA-1 can bind exon sequences derived from its own <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expressed from the Fp promoter, as found in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-related cells and in nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBNA-1 has been identified as a component in an <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> complex; moreover, an anti-EBNA-1 antibody 1H4-1, that does not inhibit DNA binding, blocks binding to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arginine/glycine-containing (so-called 'RGG') motifs have been found in an increasing number of proteins that interact with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EBV antigen contains three potential 'RGG' motifs located around an internal glycine/alanine-rich repetitive sequence in the protein, and outside the region of EBNA-1 mapped previously as essential for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA replication and other functionally defined properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These motifs could be involved in the observed binding between EBNA-1 and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
