<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 17 cases of Brazilian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> previously demonstrated to be EBV-positive to determine the EBV type as well as the presence of a characteristic 30 bp deletion within the 3' end of the latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) gene that may be important to the pathogenesis of several EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases in which the age was known were children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found type A EBV in 13 of 14 (93%) evaluable cases, and type B in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LMP-1 deletion was found in 12 of 15 (80%) evaluable cases, including the one case of type B EBV, and a similar high prevalence (59%) of the deletion was detected in EBV-positive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and reactive lymphoid tissues from individuals from the same geographic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high proportion of cases associated with type A EBV suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> is not an important factor in the pathogenesis of Brazilian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, in contrast to endemic African <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of the LMP-1 deletion in a high prevalence in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population in this region is unexplained </plain></SENT>
