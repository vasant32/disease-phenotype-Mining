<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have used a combination of hydropathy analysis of the intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 (ICAM-1) sequence and dot-matrix comparison of the sequence with the homologous, but functionally distinct, protein myelin-associated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> to identify a putative functional binding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One polar, and presumably surface-exposed, region of ICAM-1 showed no significant identity with myelin-associated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> analog based on the sequence of this region (JF9) mimicked the inhibitory effects of the anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody WEHI-CAM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These included inhibition of ICAM-1-dependent homotypic aggregation of Raji Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol-ester</z:chebi> treated U937 cells at concentrations as low as 80 micrograms/ml (24 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, at a concentration of 100 micrograms/ml, the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> analog effectively inhibited cytotoxic cell activity, an ICAM-1-dependent effector function of the immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This simple method of sequence analysis may have general applicability to the identification of functional domains in homologous, but functionally distinct, proteins such as the translated products of gene families </plain></SENT>
