<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Emu-Myc transgenic mouse appears to be an accurate model of human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that bears MYC/Immunoglobulin gene translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Id2, a negative regulator of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, has also been proposed as a Myc target gene that drives the proliferative response of Myc by binding to and overriding the checkpoint functions of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Targeted deletion of Id2 in mice results in defects in B-cell development and prevents the development of peripheral lymphoid nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In precancerous B cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that arise in Emu-Myc transgenic mice and in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, Id2 is overexpressed, suggesting that it plays a regulatory role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, despite these connections, Emu-Myc mice lacking Id2 succumb to lethal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at rates comparable with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Emu-Myc transgenics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, precancerous splenic B cells lacking Id2 do not exhibit any significant defects in Myc-induced target gene transactivation and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, due to their lack of secondary lymph nodes, Emu-Myc mice lacking Id2 rather succumb to disseminated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with an associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, with pronounced infiltrates of the bone marrow and other major organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively these findings argue that targeting Id2 functions may be ineffective in preventing Myc-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
