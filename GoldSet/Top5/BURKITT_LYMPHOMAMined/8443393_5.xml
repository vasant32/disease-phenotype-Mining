<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The radiation sensitivity of primary clonogenic blasts from 27 children with immunologically classified CD2-CD5-CD7-CD19+slg- B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) was analyzed using leukemic progenitor cell (LPC) colony assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiation survival curves of primary clonogenic blasts (ie, LPC) were constructed for each patient using computer programs for the single-hit multitarget as well as the linear quadratic models of cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The D0 values ranged from 49 to 891 cGy (median, 239 cGy; mean +/- SE, 307 +/- 44 cGy) and the alpha values ranged from 0.000 to 2.047 Gy-1 (median, 0.156 Gy-1; mean +/- SE, 0.284 +/- 0.078 Gy-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into groups according to sex, age, white blood cell count (WBC) at diagnosis, plating efficiency of primary bone marrow blasts, and immunophenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient sex, age, WBC at diagnosis, or in vitro plating efficiency was not associated with radiation resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, freshly isolated primary clonogenic blasts from patients with a CD19+CD24-CD34+ composite immunophenotype (stage I B-cell precursor [BCP]) had 2.2-fold higher D0 values (P = .005) and 3.4-fold lower alpha values (P = .05) than those from patients with a CD19+CD24+CD34+ (stage II BCP) or CD19+CD24+CD34- (stage III BCP) immunophenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative values for CD24- primary clonogenic blasts signify greater intrinsic radiation resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the CD19+CD24-CD34+ immunophenotype had a larger radiation resistant fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whereas only 60% of CD19+CD24+CD34+ and 33% of CD19+CD24+CD34- cases had clonogenic blasts with alpha &lt; or = 0.2, 100% of CD19+CD24-CD34+ cases had clonogenic blasts with alpha &lt; or = 0.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, clonogenic blasts from established CD19+CD24- B-lineage ALL cell lines were significantly more radiation resistant than CD19+CD24+ B-lineage ALL cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Notably, radiation doses sufficient to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CD24- B-lineage ALL cells were higher than those capable of inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in CD24+ B-lineage ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the lack of CD24 surface antigen expression in B-lineage ALL is associated with intrinsic radiation resistance at the level of primary clonogenic blasts </plain></SENT>
