<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is shown that while, in the case of the African biopsy, large pieces of EBV DNA sequences are integrated into the host DNA, much smaller pieces of virus DNA are integrated into the DNA of the SU-AmB-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The possibility that this difference might be related to the fact that EBV is rarely associated with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> outside East Africa is discussed </plain></SENT>
