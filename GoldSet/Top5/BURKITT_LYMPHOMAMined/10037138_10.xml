<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although CTCF has been characterized in some detail, there is very little information about the regulation of CTCF activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore we investigated CTCF expression and phosphorylation during induced differentiation of human myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that: (i) both CTCF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein are down-regulated during terminal differentiation in most cell lines tested; (ii) CTCF down-regulation is retarded and less pronounced than that of c-myc; (iii) CTCF protein is differentially phosphorylated and the phosphorylation profiles depend on the differentiation pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We concluded that CTCF expression and activity is controlled at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels </plain></SENT>
