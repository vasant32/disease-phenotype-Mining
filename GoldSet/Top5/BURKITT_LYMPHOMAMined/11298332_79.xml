<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the role of NKG2D in the natural cytolysis mediated by NK cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of NKG2D varied depending on the type of target cells analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lysis of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> appeared to be exclusively natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR) dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, killing of another group of target cells, including not only the epithelial cell lines HELA and IGROV-1, but also the FO-1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, the JA3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, the Daudi Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and even <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PHA-induced lymphoblasts, involved both NCR and NKG2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, NK cell clones expressing low surface densities of NCR (NCR(dull)) could lyse these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in an exclusively NKG2D-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these targets expressed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>/B, thus implying the existence of additional ligands recognized by NKG2D, possibly represented by GPI-linked molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that the engagement of different HLA class I-specific inhibitory receptors by either specific antibodies or the appropriate HLA class I ligand led to inhibition of NKG2D-mediated NK cell triggering </plain></SENT>
