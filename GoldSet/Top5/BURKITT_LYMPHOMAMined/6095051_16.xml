<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Translational efficiency was inferred by measuring the number of ribosomes associated with the cMyc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, using a procedure by which individual polysomal fractions were analyzed by blot hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since polysome size is a function of the length of the translated sequence as well as the rate of initiation of protein synthesis, we also determined the number of ribosomes associated with a control <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (alpha tubulin) which codes for a protein of similar size to cMyc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the cMyc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was associated with a number of ribosomes comparable to that associated with alpha tubulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
