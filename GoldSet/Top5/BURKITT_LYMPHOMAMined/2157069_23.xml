<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activities of progressively longer upstream elements from bases -55 to -2350 were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At least two positive cis-activating regulatory components (-155 to -147 and -234 to -205) upstream of the LMP promoter were defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LMP promoter cat gene constructs were more active in a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line latently infected with the B95 EBV strain than in the same cells latently infected with the P3HR1 EBV strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the P3HR1- and B95-infected cells differ in EBNA-2 and EBNA-LP expression, EBNA-2 or EBNA-LP is a likely transactivator of the LMP promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Probable cognate sequences for known transcription factors in the LMP promoter are discussed </plain></SENT>
