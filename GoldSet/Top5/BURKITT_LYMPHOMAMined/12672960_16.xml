<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used a modified subtractive suppression hybridization to identify cellular genes that show altered expression in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>) in the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the gene expression patterns of an EBV-negative clone of the originally EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line Akata, with its Neo(R)-EBV derivative, revealed a significant difference in the expression of the T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> 1 oncogene (TCL-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequent expression studies showed that the original EBV-positive Akata line and the EBV-reconstituted derivative expressed high levels of TCL-1, whereas the EBV-negative variant showed only a low level of expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two other independently established EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> (Mutu and OMA) that have also thrown off EBV showed a similar decrease in TCL-1 expression after virus loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reinfection with Neo(R)-EBV restored the TCL-1 expression levels in the EBV loss variants to as high a level as the originally EBV-positive lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-resolution immunostaining showed that TCL-1 was localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that high expression of TCL-1 is necessary for the development of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In view of the fact that germinal center B cells, regarded as the progenitors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, do not express TCL-1, we suggest that constitutive expression of this oncogene occurs by genetic or epigenetic changes in the EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the originally EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>, the ability of the virus to switch on TCL-1 expression would obviate this need </plain></SENT>
