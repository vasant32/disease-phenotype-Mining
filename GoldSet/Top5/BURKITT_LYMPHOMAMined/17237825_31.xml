<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities are important for the classification and risk stratification of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, approximately 30% of childhood and 50% of adult patients lack abnormalities with clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the use of array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to identify copy number alterations (CNA) in 58 ALL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CNA were identified in 83% of cases, and most frequently involved chromosomes 21 (n=42), 9 (n=21), 6 (n=16), 12 (n=11), 15 (n=11), 8 (n=10) and 17 (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deletions of 6q (del(6q)) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in size, in agreement with previous data, demonstrating the sensitivity of aCGH to measure CNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although 9p deletions showed considerable variability in both the extent and location, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> encompassed the CDKN2A locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients showed del(12p), with a common region encompassing the ETV6 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complex CNA were observed involving chromosomes 6 (n=2), 15 (n=2) and 21 (n=11) with multiple regions of loss and gain along each chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 21 CNA shared a common region of gain, with associated subtelomeric deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other recurrent findings included dim(13q), dim(16q) and enh(17q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of genome-wide detection of CNA in ALL patients using aCGH, and it has demonstrated a higher level of karyotype complexity than anticipated from conventional cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
