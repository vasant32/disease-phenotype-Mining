<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) using immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements as PCR targets provides important prognostic information on the in vivo effectiveness of treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report on the real-time quantification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> in 25 ALL patients using LightCycler technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We designed and adapted allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO)-PCR protocols that enabled the detection of &gt;90% of the IGH, IGK, TCRD, and TCRG rearrangements observed in ALL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, at least two suitable markers could be identified (average, 3.4 markers/patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We applied ASO-PCR with 35 immunoglobulin and TCR rearrangements (11 IGH, 6 IGK, 12 TCRG, and 6 TCRD) and compared the sensitivity and practicability of the LightCycler strategy with conventional ASO-PCR on a block thermocycler followed by quantification with gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The LightCycler measured <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-specific PCR products at each cycle (real-time) by staining the PCR product with the DNA-binding dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51461">SYBR Green I</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LightCycler technology showed a higher sensitivity than the conventional method in eight cases, whereas the sensitivity of the other markers matched exactly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The detection level varied between 10(-4) and 10(-6) leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we determined the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> status of 27 bone marrow follow-up samples from 15 ALL patients by both methods and revealed comparable results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the LightCycler also allowed accurate quantification in samples containing relatively high levels (&gt;10(-3)) of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The conventional ASO-PCR technique comprises various laborious and time-consuming PCR experiments and post-PCR steps to determine the number of cycles with the optimal linearity and sensitivity of the PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Real-time quantification through LightCycler technology obviates these post-PCR steps, provides the highest sensitivity via software analysis, and therefore represents a rapid, reliable, sensitive, and cost-effective technique for the routine monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> in ALL patients </plain></SENT>
