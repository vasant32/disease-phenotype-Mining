<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was analyzed for EBV by EBER1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in situ hybridization (EBV-RISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases showing hybridization signal within neoplastic cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reactive tonsillar tissues were analyzed for EBV strain type by EBNA-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for the presence of a del-LMP-1 by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight of 10 (80%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were EBV+, each containing EBV strain A and a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> LMP-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 4 of 30 DLCL (13%) cases were EBV positive (three strain A, one strain B), each containing a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> LMP-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of 30 tonsillar biopsy specimens contained EBV, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were strain A and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> for LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of EBV in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> from Pakistan is slightly lower than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in endemic regions, but significantly higher than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBV positivity probably reflects the socioeconomic status of the patient population and age at seroconversion </plain></SENT>
