<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy six clones gave detectable immunofluorescence staining on LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five independent monoclonal antibodies detected a group of apparently novel, high M(r) (&gt; 200,000) proteins that shared common features of subcellular distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In LCLs, these proteins were preferentially associated with vimentin filaments in the cytoplasm and with distinct nuclear foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The appearance of the latter differed from the premyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated protein, EBV nuclear antigen #5, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo>-protein-positive bodies that were used for immunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They seemed to be connected to the cytoplasmic filaments through thin fibrillar nuclear structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In mitotic cells, these complex structures rearranged into a perichromosomal basket that was associated with vimentin filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The target proteins, operationally designated as proteins associated with nuclear dots and cytoplasmic filaments (pNDCFs), were not present in resting human B cells or were expressed at a low level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The level increased considerably after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> or mitogenic stimulation by interleukin 4 and anti-CD40 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) type I lines phenotypically representative of the in vivo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, the pNDCFs were either absent or exclusively localized to the nucleus, usually to well-defined nuclear foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>EBV-positive type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> often shift to a more LCL-like (type III) phenotype during prolonged in vitro propagation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Type I cells express only EBV nuclear antigen 1 and the surface markers CD10 and CD77, whereas type III express <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine growth-associated EBV-encoded proteins and a gamut of B-cell activation markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Most of the type III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines contained increased amounts of pNDCFs bound to cytoplasmic filaments, as seen in the LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We propose that the expression of vimentin-associated pNDCFs should be included in the definition of type III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
