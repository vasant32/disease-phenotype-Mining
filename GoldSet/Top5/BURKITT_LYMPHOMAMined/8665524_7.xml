<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis of various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells using monoclonal antibodies revealed that GD3 was expressed at a moderate level on adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ATL) cells and weakly on T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, high levels of GD3 synthase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in ATL and low levels in T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were demonstrated by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-level expression of the GD3 synthase gene in ATL cells was detected in the uncultured state, and was not changed during short-term culture in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was in contrast with the rapid up-regulation of GM2/GD2 synthase gene, which was observed within 24 h after start of culture after the emergence of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) gene expression in cultured <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T lymphocytes with or without HTLV-I p40tax protein, GD3 synthase gene was almost equally expressed, whereas GM2/GD2 synthase gene was much more strongly expressed in the p40tax-positive T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicated that the GD3 synthase gene was highly expressed in ATL cells unrelated to HTLV-I genome expression </plain></SENT>
