<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chimaeric Lym-1 (chLym-1) is a monoclonal antibody generated by fusing the variable region genes of murine Lym-1 to human gamma1 and kappa constant regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Owing to its selectivity and avidity for human malignant B cells, it is an attractive candidate for developing immune-interventions in B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the attempt to identify rational bases for optimizing potential chLym-1 related therapeutic approaches, we studied the ability of this ch-mAb to trigger neutrophil-mediated Raji cell cytolysis in cooperation with two neutrophil-related cytokines, G-CSF and GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ChLym-1 triggered low levels of cytolysis by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neutrophils but induced consistent cytolysis in neutrophils from individuals treated with G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When exposed to GM-CSF, neutrophils from subjects treated with G-CSF became potent effectors, also leading to 75% lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By using mAbs specific for distinct FcgammaRs, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neutrophils were inhibited by mAb IV.3, suggesting the intervention of FcgammaRII, constitutively expressed on the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, neutrophils from patients treated with G-CSF were inhibited by mAb IV.3 plus mAb 197, a finding consistent with a cooperative intervention of FCgammaRII and G-CSF-induced FcgammaRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anti-FcgammaRIII mAb 3G8 promoted significant enhancement of the neutrophil cytolytic efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, neutrophil FcgammaRIII behaves as a down-regulator of the cytolytic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest new attempts to develop mAb-based and G-CSF/GM-CSF combined immune-interventions in B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
