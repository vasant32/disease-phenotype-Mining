<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a case-control study of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> among children (aged &lt; or = 15 years) admitted to the pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> unit in Blantyre, Malawi between July 2005 and July 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases were 148 children diagnosed with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and controls were 104 children admitted with non-malignant conditions or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1707251" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers other</z:e> than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> and Kaposi <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interviews were conducted and serological samples tested for antibodies against HIV, EBV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were estimated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for sex, age, and residential district </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases had a mean age of 7.1 years and 60% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases were more likely than controls to be HIV positive (Odds ratio (OR)) = 12.4, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.3 to 116.2, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ORs for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> increased with increasing antibody titers against EBV (p = 0.001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among HIV negative participants, cases were thirteen times more likely than controls to have raised levels of both EBV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> antibodies (OR = 13.2; 95% CI 3.8 to 46.6; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reported use of mosquito nets was associated with a lower risk of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 0.2, 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.9, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support prior evidence that EBV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> act jointly in the pathogenesis of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, suggesting that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> prevention may decrease the risk of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HIV may also play a role in the etiology of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
