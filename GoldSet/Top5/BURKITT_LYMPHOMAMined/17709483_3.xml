<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additional outcomes, particularly differentiation, demand higher CD40 occupancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, focusing on survival, we compared changes in the transcriptome of pleiotropically competent, early passage L3055 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells confronted with low (picomolar) and high (nanomolar) concentrations of CD154 to gain insight into how a single receptor sets these distinct phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 267 genes altering transcriptional activity in response to strong CD154 tone, only 25 changed coordinately on low receptor occupancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven of the top nine common up-regulated genes were targets of NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct measurement and functional inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway revealed it to be central to a CD40-dependent survival signature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the canonical NF-kappaB axis was engaged by both signaling strengths equally, robust alternative pathway activation was a feature selective to a strong CD40 signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Discriminatory exploitation of the two separate arms of NF-kappaB activation may indicate a principle whereby a cell senses and reacts differentially to shifting ligand availability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Identifying components selectively coupling CD40 to each axis could indicate targets for disruption in B cell pathologies underpinned by ectopic and/or hyper-CD154 activity such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
