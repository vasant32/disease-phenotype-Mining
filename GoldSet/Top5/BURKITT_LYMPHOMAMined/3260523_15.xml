<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The CD1 cluster of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c, identifies molecules that are differentially expressed on hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our earlier finding that the mantle zone (MZ) but not the germinal center (GC) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymph nodes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) is CD1c+, CD1a-, and CD1b- prompted us to further investigate the expression of these molecules on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, activated, and malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report that blood and spleen contain CD1c+ B cells that account for 49% +/- 20.4% (mean +/- SD) and 50.9% +/- 4.4% of the total B cell population, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD1a- and CD1b-specific MoAbs are unreactive with both B and T cells; these latter are CD1c- as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When CD1c+ and CD1c- B cells are activated in vitro, the CD1c molecule is upregulated in the former subset and induced de novo in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, activated blood T cells remain CD1c- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither CD1a nor CD1b molecules are detected on activated T and B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At ultrastructural level, the CD1c+ B cells exhibit distinctive features, namely, condensed chromatin with or without a nucleolus and a unique cluster of cytoplasmic vesicles and organelles; the number of nucleolated cells is higher in the spleen (95%) than in the tonsil (40%) or blood (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings further confirm the similarity between blood and MZ B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CD1c expression assessed on 27 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (B-CLL) and 46 B non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (B-NHL) was detected on 41% and 32% of cases, respectively; the latter comprised four follicular and 11 diffuse histotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were CD1c-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CD1a- and, except for four with a weak cytoplasmic staining, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CD1b- as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The clear-cut CD1c distribution in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> (MZ+, GC-) contrasted with the evidence that some B-NHL cells of GC origin (eg, follicular with predominantly small cleaved cells) were CD1c+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, the finding that CD1c expression is restricted to a fraction of B cells present in lymphoid organs and in peripheral blood indicates that CD1c is a powerful marker for the identification and dissection of B-cell subsets whose functional properties can now be evaluated </plain></SENT>
