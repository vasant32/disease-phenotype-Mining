<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this investigation was to report incidence of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in children under 15 years of age living in the vicinity of the French Marcoule nuclear reprocessing plant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This exhaustive and retrospective survey was carried out between 1985 and 1995 in children aged under 14 at the time of diagnosis and living inside a 35 kilometer zone around the nuclear site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>656 practitioners, 109 medical analysis laboratories and 5 hospitals or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> institutes were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A panel of experts checked each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 48 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (39 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> and 9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>), 15 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (8 Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>--53%--and 7 non hodgkinian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> including 5 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>), 1 case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 1 case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238463" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="FNMTC|NMTC">papillary thyroid cancer</z:e>, appeared among the 1,116,442 children-years followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were respectively 4.12 and 1.29.10(-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Standardised Incidence Ratios, calculated according to Poisson methods and bayesian inference, with various reference rates did not show any excess of risk: 100.67 (95% confidence interval 72-131) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Children under 5 years old and living in non exposed areas to dominant winds or downstream rhodanian water drawing presented a 3 or 4 fold decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> than others (the latter still having an identical risk to that of the general population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was not true for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, nor for the other age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Over the entire zone, children do not have an increased risk of malignant hematology disease but health monitoring by a systematic collection of cases remains useful around Marcoule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The assumption of aquiferous or air contamination thus still remains questionable: further studies investigating models of contamination are needed to take into account <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other nonionizing leucemogenic factors (<z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> injection in particular) or correlation studies between health indicators and dosimetry </plain></SENT>
