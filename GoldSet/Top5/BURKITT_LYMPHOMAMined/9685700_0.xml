<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A search was initiated towards the localization of novel mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor genes that may be involved in adult <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we measured the occurrence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> B-lineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) and one with undifferentiated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AUL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> exhibited a diploid karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each patient, PCR products of 130 polymorphic microsatellite markers, located in subtelomeric areas of every autosomal chromosome arm were analysed to visualize LOH events resulting from reduplication of a single mutated chromosome or from mitotic recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These kinds of LOH events contribute most to LOH in model systems but cannot be detected by classical cytogenetic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By comparing allelic PCR products in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells with those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, LOH was found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells of one ALL patient at 9p which harbours the known p16INK4A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AUL</z:e> patient, however, LOH was detected at the telomeres of 4q and 21q, suggesting that these sites may contain novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor genes specifically involved in this form of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the DNA of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells from eight out of 10 patients no LOH was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast with the general assumption that LOH is a frequent phenomenon in ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, some markers at telomeric regions of chromosomes were already homozygous in the control T-cells of several patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For instance, we found in the DNA of control cells from one patient five consecutive microsatellites on 9p up to 9p43 which were homozygous and in three other patients homozygosity was observed in band 8q24, which includes the MYC gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that LOH events already are present in non-cancerous putative stem cells and that mitotic recombination may be a very early event in leukaemogenesis </plain></SENT>
