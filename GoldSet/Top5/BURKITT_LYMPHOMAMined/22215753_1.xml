<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Adolescents (age 15 to 21 years) compared with younger children with mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) have been historically considered to have an inferior prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore analyzed the impact of age and other diagnostic factors on the risk of treatment failure in children and adolescents treated on the French-American-British Mature B-Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> 96 (FAB LMB 96) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were divided by risk: group A (limited), group B (intermediate), and group C (advanced), as previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors analyzed for event-free survival (EFS) included age (&lt; 15 v ≥ 15 years), stage (I/II v III/IV), primary site, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), bone marrow/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> (BM/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement, and histology (diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> v mediastinal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> v Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 3-year EFS for the whole cohort was 88% ± 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age was not associated as a risk factor for increased treatment failure in either univariate analysis (P = .15) or multivariate analysis (P = .58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased LDH (≥ 2 × upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> [ULN] v &lt; 2 × ULN), primary site, and BM-positive/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-positive disease were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> independent risk factors associated with a significant increase in treatment failure rate (relative risk, 2.0; P &lt; .001, P &lt; .012, and P &lt; .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LDH level at diagnosis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025061" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mediastinal disease</z:e>, and combined BM-positive/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-positive involvement are independent risk factors in children with mature B-cell NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future studies should be developed to identify specific therapeutic strategies (immunotherapy) to overcome these risk factors and to identify the biologic basis associated with these prognostic factors in children with mature B-cell NHL </plain></SENT>
