<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a novel t(7;9)(q11;p13) translocation in 2 patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By fluorescent in situ hybridization and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends, we showed that the paired box domain of PAX5 was fused with the elastin (ELN) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After cloning the full-length cDNA of the chimeric gene, confocal microscopy of transfected NIH3T3 cells and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (DG75) demonstrated that PAX5-ELN was localized in the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation clearly indicated that PAX5-ELN retained the capability to bind CD19 and BLK promoter sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To analyze the functions of the chimeric protein, HeLa cells were cotransfected with a luc-CD19 construct, pcDNA3-PAX5, and with increasing amounts of pcDNA3-PAX5-ELN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, in vitro, PAX5-ELN was able to block CD19 transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) experiments showed that PAX5-ELN was able to affect the transcription of endogenous PAX5 target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since PAX5 is essential for B-cell differentiation, this translocation may account for the blockage of leukemic cells at the pre-B-cell stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanism involved in this process appears to be, at least in part, through a dominant-negative effect of PAX5-ELN on the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> PAX5 in a setting ofPAX5 haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
