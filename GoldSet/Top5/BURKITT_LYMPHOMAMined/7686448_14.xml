<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A panel of bispecific F(ab')2 antibodies (BsAb) have been constructed for delivering the ribosome-inactivating protein saporin to human B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each derivative was prepared with specificity for saporin and CD19, CD22, CD37, or immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies measuring inhibition of [3H]leucine uptake by cultured Daudi and Raji cells demonstrated that, despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BsAb capturing saporin on the cell surface, BsAb targeting through CD22 were far more cytotoxic than those functioning via CD19, CD37, or surface immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This exceptional activity of the CD22-specific BsAb appears to derive from its ability to deliver and accumulate saporin inside the target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further studies showed that four CD22-specific BsAb <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> performed with equal potency and were able to increase saporin toxicity (50% inhibitory concentration) up to 1000-fold, from 2 x 10(-7) M to 2 x 10(-10) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pairs of anti-CD22 BsAb which recognized different nonblocking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on the saporin molecule were able to bind saporin more avidly to the target cell and, as a consequence, increased cytotoxicity by at least an additional 10-fold, resulting in 50% inhibitory concentration for protein synthesis of 2 x 10(-11) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that selected combinations of BsAb which bind cooperatively to a toxin and the cell surface may provide an efficient way of delivering toxins to unwanted cells in patients </plain></SENT>
