<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, significant expression of the c-erbA beta gene was detected in the SiHa, CaSki, HeLa cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>; Hep3B, PLC/PRF/5, Mahlavu <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo>; HT-1080 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100244'>fibrosarcoma</z:hpo> cell lines; as well as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRC-5 embryo lung and FS-4 foreskin fibroblast cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the Molt-4 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and Raji Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines exhibited very low levels of c-erbA beta expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of PCR products of the c-erbA beta hormone-binding domain cDNAs of these cell lines revealed identical sequences, but differed from the published human placental c-erbA beta sequence by five single base disparities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of an aberrant fragment fortuitously amplified from the HT-1080 cDNA library demonstrated concordance with the cDNA of pregnancy-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 4, which is related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> marker, carcinoembryonic antigen </plain></SENT>
