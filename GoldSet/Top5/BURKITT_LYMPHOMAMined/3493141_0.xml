<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With a sensitivity limit of 0.5 microgram/l, SP1 was undetectable in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High levels were observed in CSF from one pregnant woman with herpetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> and from another woman with post-puerperal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> as a result of high serum concentrations and leakage of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SP1 was detected at low levels in the CSF from 1 patient out of 5 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</z:e> and from a patient with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients out of 84 with malignant hemopathies presented cerebral involvement; 3 of them had detectable SP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, SP1 was also detected in the CSF of 2 patients in apparently complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The determination of SP1 in CSF appears to be of limited value in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> and in the early detection of a cerebral localization of malignant hemopathies </plain></SENT>
