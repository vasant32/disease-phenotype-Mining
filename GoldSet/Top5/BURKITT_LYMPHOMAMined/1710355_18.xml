<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Studies presented here show that some functions of the human herpesvirus, EBV, may be transcriptionally differentially expressed in two cell types which carry the same (C15) isolate of this virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 'latent' <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> functions investigated, only one (TP2) of the episomally-specific genes that encode terminal proteins (TP1 and TP2) is found to be expressed in the C15 epithelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> environment, whereas both are transcribed--as different, but related, messengers--in a B-cell line generated with virus from the C15 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other gene investigated is that for latent membrane protein (LMP), which is found in the same region of the EBV genome but on the opposite strand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This gene, apparently transcriptionally silent in B-cell (Burkitt's) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, is expressed in the C15 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205853" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">epithelial tumour</z:e>, as well as in other nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Promoter usage in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and B-cells appears, in some cases at least, to be cell-type specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression may also be governed by methylation since a chromosomally silent region in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (that encompassing TP1) is highly methylated on CpG residues, whereas the active region (encoding TP2 and LMP) is virtually free of such methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that there may be selective transcriptional regulation of EBV genes in the two types of cells investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, it may be unnecessary to invoke different virus genotypes to account for the two distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>--Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>--associated with EBV </plain></SENT>
