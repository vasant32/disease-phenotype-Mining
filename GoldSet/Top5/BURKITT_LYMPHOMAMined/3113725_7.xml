<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using in vitro-growing <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines, we studied the growth factors involved in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, and particularly the potential of autocrine secretion and response to B-cell growth factor (BCGF) of RPMI 8226, the best-documented Epstein-Barr virus-negative human <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that three <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines (RPMI 8226, U266, and IM9) produce an autostimulatory growth factor (AGF) and thus increase their own proliferation by 2- to 3-fold in cells cultured at low density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Optimal AGF production was obtained after 24 h of culture at a cell density ranging from 2.5 to 5 million cells/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The three <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines produce type II BCGF, able to induce the proliferation of highly purified human peripheral blood B-cells, only after anti-mu activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BCGF produced by RPMI 8226 can be absorbed onto RPMI 8226 cells together with the RPMI 8226 AGF, and the two are copurified on gel filtration in a peak with an apparent molecular weight of 70,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RPMI 8226 can be efficiently activated by human high molecular weight BCGF II (Mr 50,000) and less extensively by BCGF I (Mr 12,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RPMI 8226 does not produce either detectable IL1 or interferons gamma and alpha and IL1 and gamma-IFN had no stimulating effect on RPMI 8226 proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the conclusion that RPMI 8226 produces a BCGF II working as an AGF </plain></SENT>
