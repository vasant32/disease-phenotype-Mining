<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies were used: OKT8, OKT11, OKB2, OKIal, anti immunoglobulins (mu, kappa, lambda chains) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those of classical histology: three histologically unclassified malignant lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were linked to a <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27560">Bor</z:chebi> T line (one pre-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and two T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One diagnosis of T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> could not be confirmed by immunoperoxidase technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The technique did not reveal any surface immunoglobulins in two cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of Burkitt type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Every one of the remaining 12 cases gave concordant results between morphological and immunological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 12 cases it was possible to compare the results of immunological typing on tissue sections and cell suspension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results were concordant in 11/12 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An advantage of this immunochemical technique on frozen sections and/or cytological samples is that it gives good visualisation of the cells and their reactivity with the antibodies </plain></SENT>
