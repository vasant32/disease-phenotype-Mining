<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: : Seventy-three percent of the patients had high-risk disease, defined by stage, performance status, extranodal sites and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median CD4 cell count at diagnosis of HIV-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> was 171/ml (range: 4-848) and the plasma HIV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load was undetectable in five of 29 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : Nine patients died during treatment (disease progression, three; toxicity, five; central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system lesion not biopsied, one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response rate was 70% (complete response/complete response uncertain, 17; partial response, 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 22 months (range: 6-72), 18 patients remain alive without disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3-year overall survival and event-free survival were 52 and 75%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>Viral</z:mp> load was undetectable in 88% and CD4 cell count more than 200/ml in 58% of patients assessed 6 months after completing chemotherapy, and in 87 and 80% at 12 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: : The intensive regimen CODOX-M/IVAC, a feasible and effective chemotherapy, is associated with an excellent immunological recovery in patients with HIV-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> on HAART </plain></SENT>
