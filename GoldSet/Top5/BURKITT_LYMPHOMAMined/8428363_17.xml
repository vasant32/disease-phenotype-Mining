<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have coupled LL2 to Lys-PE38KDEL, a derivative of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) which does not bind to the PE receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LL2-PE38KDEL was cytotoxic toward several Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, with 50% inhibitory concentration values ranging from 2 to 6 ng/ml (10-30 pM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another immunotoxin, LL2-Fab'-PE38KDEL, was produced by chemically coupling the Fab' fragment of LL2 to Lys-PE38KDEL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LL2-Fab'-PE38KDEL also was cytotoxic toward the Burkitt's cells, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 1-2 ng/ml (13-24 PM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The antibody LL2 alone had no cytotoxicity toward the malignant cells, and excess LL2 prevented the cytotoxicity of LL2-PE38KDEL and LL2-Fab'-PE38KDEL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Control immunotoxins UPC-10-PE38KDEL and Mu-9-Fab'-PE38KDEL were not cytotoxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LL2-PE38KDEL and LL2-Fab'-PE38KDEL bound to cells with 50% and 17% of the affinity of LL2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both immunotoxins, but not UPC-10-PE38KDEL, prevented the development of CA-46 tumors in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LL2-PE38KDEL and LL2-Fab'-PE38KDEL, but not the control immunotoxins, led to complete regressions of measurable s.c </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LL2 alone significantly retarded the growth of CA-46 tumors but did not cause complete <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regressions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Immunotoxins containing derivatives of Pseudomonas exotoxin can be targeted to human B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and merit further study as potential therapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
