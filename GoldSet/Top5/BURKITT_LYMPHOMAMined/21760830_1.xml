<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article attempts to highlight the prospects and challenges of fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> (FNA) cytology as a tool for research in Nigeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data available in local and international bibliographic databases for the period 1986-2005 (20 years) were collated and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The theme of Nigerian FNA-focused studies correlated with the recognized disease patterns in the country which are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculous</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumors</z:e> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of FNA in these situations was high and comparable to the experience in developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was found that the total number of articles published during two contiguous periods (1986-1995 and 1996-2005) had increased from 5 to 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, in majority of cases, the articles were not published in specialized pathology journals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of FNA is apparently lagging in Nigeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given its potential in resource-constrained settings, we are of the opinion that it should be used more often in clinical and translational research </plain></SENT>
