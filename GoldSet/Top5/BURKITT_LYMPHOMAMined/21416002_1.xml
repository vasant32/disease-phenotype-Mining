<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These include <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, T/NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, post-transplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> lymphoproliferative syndrome), <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of major salivary glands, thymic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001883'>mammary carcinoma</z:mp>) and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100243'>leiomyosarcoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latent EBV genomes persist in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells as circular episomes, co-replicating with the cellular DNA once per cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of latent EBV genes is cell type specific due to the strict epigenetic control of their promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications and binding of key cellular regulatory proteins contribute to the regulation of alternative promoters for transcripts encoding the nuclear antigens EBNA1 to 6 and affect the activity of promoters for transcripts encoding transmembrane proteins (LMP1, LMP2A, LMP2B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to genes transcribed by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase II, there are also two <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase III transcribed genes in the EBV genome (EBER 1 and 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5' and internal regulatory sequences of EBER 1 and 2 transcription units are invariably unmethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highly abundant EBER 1 and 2 RNAs are not translated to protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the cell type specific epigenetic marks associated with latent EBV genomes one can distinguish between <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> epigenotypes that differ in transcriptional activity in spite of having an identical (or nearly identical) DNA sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whereas latent EBV genomes are regularly targeted by epigenetic control mechanisms in different cell types, EBV encoded proteins may, in turn, affect the activity of a set of cellular promoters by interacting with the very same epigenetic regulatory machinery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There are EBNA1 binding sites in the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because high affinity binding of EBNA1 to its recognition sites is known to specify sites of DNA demethylation, we suggest that binding of EBNA1 to its cellular target sites may elicit local demethylation and contribute thereby to the activation of silent cellular promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>EBNA2 interacts with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetyltransferases, and EBNALP (EBNA5) coactivates transcription by displacing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase 4 from EBNA2-bound promoter sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>EBNA3C (EBNA6) seems to be associated both with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylases and deacetylases, although in separate complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LMP1, a transmembrane protein involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e>, can affect both alternative systems of epigenetic memory, DNA methylation and the Polycomb-trithorax group of protein complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In epithelial cells LMP1 can up-regulate DNA methyltransferases and, in Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, induce the Polycomb group protein Bmi-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition, LMP1 can also modulate cellular gene expression programs by affecting, via the NF-ÎºB pathway, levels of cellular microRNAs miR-146a and miR-155 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These interactions may result in epigenetic dysregulation and subsequent cellular dysfunctions that may manifest in or contribute to the development of pathological changes (e.g. initiation and progression of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, autoimmune phenomena, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Thus, Epstein-Barr virus, similarly to other viruses and certain bacteria, may induce pathological changes by epigenetic reprogramming of host cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Elucidation of the epigenetic consequences of EBV-host interactions (within the framework of the emerging new field of patho-epigenetics) may have important implications for therapy and disease prevention, because epigenetic processes are reversible and continuous silencing of EBV genes contributing to patho-epigenetic changes may prevent disease development </plain></SENT>
