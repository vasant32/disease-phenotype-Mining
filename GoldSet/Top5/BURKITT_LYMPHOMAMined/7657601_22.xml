<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic cell phosphatase is a nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase that is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Motheaten mice, which are devoid of (functional) hematopoietic cell phosphatase, have severe disturbances in the regulation of B cell activation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because signals transduced via the B cell antigen receptor are known to guide these processes, we decided to analyze molecular interactions between the hematopoietic cell phosphatase and the B cell antigen receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ligation of the B cell antigen receptor induces moderate tyrosine phosphorylation of hematopoietic cell phosphatase and the formation of a multi-molecular complex containing additional 68-70- and 135-kDa phosphoproteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In resting B cells most of the hematopoietic cell phosphatase proteins reside in the cytosolic compartment, whereas after B cell antigen receptor cross-linking, a small fraction translocates toward the membrane where it specifically binds to the 135-kDa phosphoprotein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This 135-kDa <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> was identified as CD22, a transmembrane associate of the B cell antigen receptor complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together these findings provide the first direct evidence that this cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase is involved in antigen receptor-mediated B cell activation, suggesting that in vivo B cell antigen receptor constituents or associated molecules may serve as substrate for its catalytic activity </plain></SENT>
