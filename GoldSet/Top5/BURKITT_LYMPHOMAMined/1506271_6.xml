<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The supernatant IL-6R was generated only from IL-6R-positive cell lines; <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines RPMI8226 and PRMI1788, and myelomonocytic cell lines U937, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, it was not released from the IL-6R-negative cells; T cell line Molt-4 and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE analysis of the soluble IL-6R from U266 cells suggested a molecular weight of approximately 50-55 kDa, 25-30 kDa smaller than the mature cell surface receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the generation of soluble IL-6R may be a maker of <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells and myelomonocytic cells </plain></SENT>
