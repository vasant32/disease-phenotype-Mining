<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 95-base-pair immediate upstream sequence of the human class II major histocompatibility complex DQB gene containing the conserved X and Y elements showed enhancer activity in a transient expression assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An "enhancer test plasmid" harboring the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase gene under the control of a truncated simian virus 40 enhancerless early promoter was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The DQB sequence inserted into this plasmid was active as an enhancer in Raji cells (human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells) but not active in Jurkat cells (human T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells) or in HeLa cells (human cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This cell-type specificity suggests that this enhancer activity may be involved in the tissue specificity of the DQB gene that is normally expressed only in mature B cells, macrophages, and thymic epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deletion analysis showed that both X and Y box sequences are essential for the full activity of the enhancer sequence and that these two sequences may function in a cooperative manner as cis-acting elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further deletions were used to define the 5' border of the X element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that previously characterized protein factors that bind to X and Y include transcription factors involved in the cell-type specificity of this enhancer activity </plain></SENT>
