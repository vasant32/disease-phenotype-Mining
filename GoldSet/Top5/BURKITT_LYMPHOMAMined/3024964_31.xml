<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To define their molecular relationship, we have compared cloned chromosome 8 DNA from the t(2;8) breakpoint in the human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> JBL2 with cloned DNA from the murine pvt-1 locus, the major chromosome 15 breakpoint region in murine t(6;15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing and Southern blot analysis shows that these two regions are homologous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus the t(2;8) in JBL2 is the molecular equivalent of many murine t(6;15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The murine pvt-1 locus lies an unknown distance 3' of c-myc; analysis of DNA from several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> with c-myc amplification reveals that pvt-1 is co-amplified in at least one case, placing pvt-1 approximately 100-500 kb 3' of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significance of these results with respect to the role of pvt-1 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> is discussed </plain></SENT>
