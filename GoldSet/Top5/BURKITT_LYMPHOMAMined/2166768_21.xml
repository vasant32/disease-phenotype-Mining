<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> has been associated with several different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the sera of 21 CTCL patients were examined for antibodies to EBV antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using complement immunofluorescence (CIF) techniques, 13 of 21 CTCL patients had detectable antibodies to Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigens (EBNA), whereas only five of 20 control psoriatic patients were CIF positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When immunoblot analysis was employed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 21 of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTCL</z:e> patients had antibodies to the EBV antigens, EBNA, whereas only 12 of the control patients had detectable antibodies to these antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, three of 21 CTCL patients had antibodies to the EBV-associated antigen, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> nuclear antigen (RANA), as determined by double immunodiffusion, whereas none of the control sera contained anti-RANA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that antibodies against EBV antigens are found with a higher frequency and concentration in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTCL</z:e> when compared to controls and suggest that EBV products might serve as a possible stimulus for the development of this malignant disease </plain></SENT>
