<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chromosomes underwent numerical and structural rearrangements, a 14q+ marker chromosome (14q32 translocation), which was found in 31 patients, was the single most common abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In terms of survival, no significant difference was noted between the 14q+ positive and negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Donor chromosomes of a 14q32 translocation, which were identified in 27 patients, were quite variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, certain chromosomes were predisposed to act as donor chromosomes in the 14q32 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An 8;14 translocation [t(8;14) (q24;q32)] was found in six patients with diffuse non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in four patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>; in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients a stem line or the subline with a t(8;14) had partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> for 1q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An 11;14 translocation [t(11;14) (q13;q32)] was observed in one patient each with diffuse or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in two with <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>; three of the four patients had also structural rearrangements of chromosome 1 in the same cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 14;18 translocation [t(14;18) (q32;q21)] was found in six patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in one with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; however, no common involvement of other chromosomes was detected among clones of these abnormal cells with a t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 8 months for patients with a t(8;14) and 39 months for patients with a t(11;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference between the two survival curves was of borderline significance [p = 0.06] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with a t(14;18) survived significantly longer than those with a t(8;14) [p less than 0.001] or those with a t(11;14) [p = 0.03] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings revealed that in non-T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, the clinicopathologic features of the patients with a 14q+ marker depend upon the precise 14q32 translocation and the subsequent karyotypic evolution, although the translocation was not always correlated with a particular type of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
