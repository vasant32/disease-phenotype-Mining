<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forward light scatter (FSC) and CD71 fluorescence intensity (CD71i) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were measured and normalized by corresponding values for resting T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in CD71i values between low- and high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were observed by the Mann-Whitney U test (P &lt; .001) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FSC was not significantly different between low- and high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; the area under the ROC curve was less than that for CD71i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither FSC nor CD71i significantly differentiated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A comparison of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FLs (grades 1-3) and non-FL high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>] and large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [LBCL]) showed significant differences in CD71i (P &lt; .001) and FSC (P = .021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences were significant in CD71i and FSC between FL and LBCL (P &lt; .001) but not between FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD71i is more potent than FSC for distinguishing CD10+ low- from high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and FL from non-FL high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity are limited owing to inability to identify FL3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In ROC analysis, a high value for CD71i can identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and LBCL with a high degree of certainty </plain></SENT>
