<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, the use of single-cell polymerase chain reaction analysis has allowed for a better understanding of the origin of several entities, eg, Hodgkin's, Burkitt's, and marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Second, the studies of mechanisms regulating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and survival of the neoplastic clones have opened a whole area of research with promising expectations for new therapeutical approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, the recent cloning of genes involved in several chromosomal translocations is likely to shed more light on the molecular mechanisms responsible for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The survey presents the main results obtained in these three areas and critically discusses them in the light of the current debate </plain></SENT>
