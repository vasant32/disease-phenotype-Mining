<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These results have evidenced the expedience of using these criteria for correct identification of leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides that, similarity of phenotypic features of leukemic cells of a particular line, having identical differentiation status, has supported the opinion on their lineal affiliation </plain></SENT>
