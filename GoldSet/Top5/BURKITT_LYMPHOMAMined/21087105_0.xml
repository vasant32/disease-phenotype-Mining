<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vivo targeting of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with glycan ligands of CD22 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A strategy has been developed to deliver selectively chemotherapeutic drugs to B cells by employing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-loaded liposomes modified by a ligand for the B-cell-specific cell-surface protein CD22, also known as Siglec-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The liposomes bound in a rapid and saturable manner to the human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Daudi B-cell line and exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo compared with similar untargeted liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CD22-targeted liposome bound to B cells isolated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients and although binding was proportional to CD22 expression on the cell surface, low levels of expression on <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cells were sufficient to effect cell neutralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The glycan-based strategy for delivery of chemotherapeutic agents may provide a new strategy for the treatment of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
