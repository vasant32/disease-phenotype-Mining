<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In African settings the treatment results of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) seem to be less favourable compared with Western settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective study was to analyse some factors that affect the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a 16 year period, data were extracted of 80 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remission 5%, very good partial response 35%, partial response 16%, no response 10%, data missing 34% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 56% did have a positive response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 51% of this subgroup of patients did not finish treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in completion of treatment between patients living in Katete district finishing treatment vs. living outside Katete district (respectively 25% vs. 32%, P = 0.7148) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is potential for higher cure rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in tropical settings if full effort is put into compliance since a majority of patients, even while having a good prognosis, abandon treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Large distance to hospital makes no difference in completing the chemotherapy course </plain></SENT>
