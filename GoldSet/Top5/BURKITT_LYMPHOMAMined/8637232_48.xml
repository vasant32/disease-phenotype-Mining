<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the extracellular domain of human FLT3 were generated to study the cell surface expression of this class III RTK on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells and on leukemic blasts from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis of five mAbs (SF1 series) revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them can mimic to variable extents the activity of the FLT3 ligand (FL) upon receptor activation and modulation, while only one mAb weakly inhibited ligand binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using flow cytometry, we detected surface expression of FLT3 on cell lines of the myeloid (4/8) and B lymphoid (7/10) lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow cells, the expression of FLT3 is restricted, in agreement with a presumed function of this receptor at the level of the stem cells and early committed progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of FLT3 was found on a fraction of CD34-positive and CD34-negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three-color analysis further revealed that most of the CD34 FLT3+ cells coexpress CD117 (KIT) at a high level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, FLT3 is expressed on leukemic blasts of 18/22 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and 3/5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemias</z:hpo> (ALL) of the B lineage, providing a possible application in diagnosis and therapy of these diseases </plain></SENT>
