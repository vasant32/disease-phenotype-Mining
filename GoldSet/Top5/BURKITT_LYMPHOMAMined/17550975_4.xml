<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular dendritic cells (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>) in the germinal centers (GC) of secondary lymphoid organs increase the survival and proliferation of antigen-stimulated B cells and are pivotal for the affinity maturation of an antibody response and for maintenance of B cell immunological memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dark zone (DZ) and the light zone (LZ) constitute distinct areas of the GC containing different subtypes of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> as identified by their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until now, most available <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>-specific reagents identify LZ <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>, and there are no reagents recognizing DZ <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> specifically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a new mAb, D46, which stains <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> specifically in the DZ of bovine and ovine GC within the secondary follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identify its ligand as bovine fibrinogen, and using commercially available anti-human fibrinogen antibodies, show that this inflammatory protein is also present on DZ <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> of human GC within palatine tonsils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the addition of exogenous fibrinogen stimulates the proliferation and survival of BCR-stimulated L3055 cells, which constitute a clonal population of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> cells and retain important features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GC B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, our results suggest that fibrinogen localized on DZ <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> could support the extensive proliferation and survival of GC B cells within the DZ in vivo </plain></SENT>
