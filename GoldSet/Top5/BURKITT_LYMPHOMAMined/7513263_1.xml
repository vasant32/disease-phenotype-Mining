<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since this morphological evidence has been found to be preceded by a slowing down of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcriptional machinery early upon the interferon administration, it is speculated that interferon generated signals might lead to RNP granule accumulation in the nucleus and a consequent arrangement into defined structures </plain></SENT>
