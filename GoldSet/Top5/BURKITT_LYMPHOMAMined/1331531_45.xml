<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines exhibiting the latency I form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (i.e., EBV nuclear antigen 1 [EBNA1] positive in the absence of other latent proteins), the EBNA1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> has a unique BamHI Q/U/K splice structure and is expressed from a novel promoter, Fp, located near the BamHI FQ boundary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with the situation in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) exhibiting the latency III form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (i.e., positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> latent proteins), in which transcription from the upstream Cp or Wp promoters is the principal source of EBNA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We carried out cDNA amplifications with oligonucleotide primer-probe combinations to determine whether Fp is ever active in an LCL environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results clearly showed that some LCLs express a Q/U/K-spliced EBNA1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in addition to the expected Cp/Wp-initiated transcripts; this seemed inconsistent with the concept of Cp/Wp and Fp as mutually exclusive promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show that Fp is indeed silent in latency III cells but is activated at an early stage following the switch from latency III into the virus lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four pieces of evidence support this conclusion: (i) examples of coincident Cp/Wp and Fp usage in LCLs are restricted to those lines in which a small subpopulation of cells have spontaneously entered the lytic cycle; (ii) transcripts initiating from Fp can readily be demonstrated in spontaneously productive lines by S1 nuclease protection; (iii) the presence of Fp-initiated transcripts is not affected by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> blockade of the late lytic cycle; and (iv) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of latently infected LCLs with a recombinant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042214" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vaccinia</z:e> virus encoding the EBV immediate-early protein BZLF1, a transcriptional transactivator which normally initiates the lytic cycle, results in the appearance of the diagnostic Q/U/K-spliced transcripts </plain></SENT>
