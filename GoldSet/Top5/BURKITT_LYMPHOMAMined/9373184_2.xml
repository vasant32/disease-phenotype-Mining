<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the conditions for the successful solubilization of human TAP from cellular membranes while maintaining TAP <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, solubilized TAP was incorporated into proteoliposomes and shown to possess specific <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These studies provide the foundation for future attempts to achieve the complete functional reconstitution of TAP, which includes <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> transport </plain></SENT>
