<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our former research, this study was designed to clone and analyze a novel NPC-associated gene at this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The full-length cDNA sequence of this gene was obtained by plasmid cDNA sequencing and RACE,and analyzed by bioinformatics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pEGFP-C2/STGC3 fusion mammalian expression vector was constructed, and transfected into COS7 and CNE2 cell lines mediated by lipofectin to analyze the subcellular localization of gene expressing proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of STGC3 was detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines by Northern blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An 1 271 bp full-length cDNA sequence of gene,which had no obvious homology with other known genes in bioinformatic databases,was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This gene,named STGC3 (GenBank accession number:AY078383), localized on chromosome 3p21, and encodes a protein consisting of 146 amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Protein localization analysis under fluorescent microscope indicated that STGC3 fusion protein was distributed in nucleus and cytoplasm 24-48 hours after transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MTE(TM)Array2 Northern blot analysis showed STGC3 expressed in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells,while its expression down-regulated in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines, such as Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: STGC3 is a novel gene, and down-regulated in NPC and many other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>STGC3 fusion protein distributes in cytoplasm and nucleus </plain></SENT>
