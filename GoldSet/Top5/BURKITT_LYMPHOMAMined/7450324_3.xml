<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In birds, the heterogametic female sex is H-Y antigen positive, and not the male as in mammals </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A similar result is obtained after cultivation of chicken testicular cells in the supernatant medium of cultured human male Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rat testicular Sertoli cells as well as Daudi cells are a source of H-Y antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous application of H-Y antigen and anti-H-Y antiserum prevents <z:mp ids='MP_0002996'>ovotestis</z:mp> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that H-Y antigen which is known to be testis-organizing in mammals, is the ovary-organizing factor in birds </plain></SENT>
