<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A surgeon in the Colonial Medical Service in Uganda, his keen observation of the incidence of jaw <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> in children led him to describe a new form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920571" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphatic cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He confirmed, for the first time in man, that a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was caused by a virus and, most remarkable of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, he discovered a cure--low-dose chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The condition was named after him--Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>--and with this came membership of a select group of eponymous Irishmen, including Graves, Colles and Corrigan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His ability to link the incidence of disease with geographical distribution brought him, first to question and then to champion Peter Cleave's theory that lack of dietary fibre contributed to many of the diseases common in western civilisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the process, he changed the dietary habits of the Western world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Yet Denis Burkitt's early career in Trinity College, Dublin was not auspicious for, as a Junior Freshman engineer in 1929, his tutor despaired of him, writing to his father 'Don't blame me if he gets stuck' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A happy irony then, that the College made him an Honorary Fellow half a century later </plain></SENT>
