<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cross-linkage of the CD95 (FAS/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1) antigen is responsible for the induction of programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a variety of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant cells of the haemopoietic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate predominant expression of the CD95 gene in a cell lineage-specific manner, we have determined the CD95 expression patterns in cell lines of myeloid, T-, pre-B- or B-cell origin as well as those established from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results reveal constitutive transcriptional activation of the CD95 gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines derived from the lymphoid and myeloid lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the ubiquitous expression of CD95 transcripts in haemopoietic cells, the corresponding protein was undetectable in 2/5 cell lines derived from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 6/16 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> cell lines of the megakaryocytic or monocytic lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an effort to identify <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-resistant cell lines resulting from mutations in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-signalling domain of CD9 5 or from defects in the apoptotic pathway or in survival programmes, we applied a CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 21/38 CD95-expressing cell lines were sensitive upon induction with an anti-CD95 antibody whereas the remaining cell lines (predominantly of myeloid derivation) were resistant to antibody-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Resistance to CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was not due to mutations within the CD95 open reading frame as confirmed by a combined reverse transcription PCR sequencing method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five myeloid out of 13 tumour lines with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-resistance phenotype analysed showed programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, when protein synthesis was blocked by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> prior to CD95-mediated induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest an active cellular mechanism for the maintenance of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-resistant phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elucidating the steps in such an active process of resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> might be expected to provide new approaches for therapeutic intervention in certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
