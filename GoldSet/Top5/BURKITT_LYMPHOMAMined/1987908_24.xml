<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To describe their histologic subtypes, a group of pathologists was formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred thirteen cases were reviewed and classified according to the Working Formulation, the updated Kiel classification, and a recent description of morphologic variants of high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three major types of intermediate- or high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were observed: (1) large-cell or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> mainly polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a component of immunoblasts (35 cases); (2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with plasmablastic and plasmacytic features in most cases (33 cases); and (3) small non-cleaved cell Burkitt's or non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (41 cases), with 15 cases fitting typical criteria of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 26 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> cases in which the size and shape of the cells and the presence of plasmablastic features varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent pathologic sites of involvement at presentation were the lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, brain, oral cavity, and muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A comparison between the histologic type and the site of involvement showed that most cases involving lymph nodes, bone marrow, or muscles were small noncleaved cell Burkitt's or non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, while those that affected the gastrointestinal tract, brain, and oral cavity were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with consistent plasmacytic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 10 cases, previous persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0008940'>generalized lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> syndrome was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 13 cases, the lymphomatous proliferation was associated with follicular or diffuse <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> seen on the same lymph node biopsy specimen or in another lymph node </plain></SENT>
