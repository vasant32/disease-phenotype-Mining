<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The LyGPR amino acid sequence is 375 residues long and shows similarity (about 30-35% identity) both to the angiotensin receptors and members of the chemokine receptor family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis revealed a 3.1-kb LyGPR transcript expressed predominantly in lung, heart and lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LyGPR expression was also detected in the pre-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines Reh and Nalm-6, in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line Daudi, and in hematopoietic progenitor cells from bone marrow, as well as in B cells, T cells and monocytes from peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
