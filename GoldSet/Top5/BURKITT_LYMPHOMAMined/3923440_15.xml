<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overlapping clones encompassing the coding sequence of the Ig lambda <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were isolated and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The predicted amino acid sequence shows a short hydrophobic leader <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and a mature <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> of 217 residues in which V, J and C regions can be distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The V region belongs to subgroup VI and has greatest homology (80%) with the Amyloid-AR protein </plain></SENT>
