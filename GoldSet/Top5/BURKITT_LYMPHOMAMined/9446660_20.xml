<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32) is the characteristic chromosomal aberration of Burkitt's-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the molecular level, the t(8;14) juxtaposes the c-myc gene in 8q24 next to the IgH locus in 14q32, resulting in overexpression of the transcription factor c-Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The detection of a t(8;14) is a major aim in the diagnostic process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> because treatment strategies differ between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and other high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As chromosome analyses are sometimes hampered by the low yield or poor quality of metaphase spreads and as the application of molecular genetic techniques is limited by the distribution of the 8q24 breakpoints over a region of about some hundred kilobases, we set out to establish an interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for the detection of the t(8;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cosmid probe hybridizing to the IgH constant region in 14q32 was combined with a differently labeled probe of pooled cosmid clones spanning the c-myc locus in 8q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interphase nuclei lacking a t(8;14) show two separated signals corresponding to each probe, whereas interphase nuclei carrying a t(8;14) display a split of the c-myc probe and a colocalization of at least one of the splitted signals with the IgH probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of extensive control studies, the cutoff level for this stringent (type I) criteria was set at 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, colocalization of at least one c-myc signal with one IgH signal alone (without signal split for the c-myc probe) was used as a less stringent (type II) criteria with a cutoff limit of 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> and one Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were investigated by this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> contained a translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32) except for one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, in which cytogenetic analysis had failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In interphase FISH, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> met the less stringent criteria for the diagnosis of the t(8;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> but the Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, a t(8;14) could be diagnosed according to the stringent criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The percentage of cells found to harbor the t(8;14) by FISH ranged from 4.3% to 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Comparison of cytogenetic and FISH results revealed a significantly lower percentage of t(8;14)+ interphase nuclei than metaphase cells (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the described FISH assay provides a feasible and sensitive tool for the routine detection of the translocation t(8;14) in interphase cells which might also offer new insights into the biology of high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
