<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated samples of 56 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients for the translocations t(8;14)(q24;q32), t(2;8)(p11;q24) and t(8;22)(q24;q11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Long PCR was used for detecting the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) translocation and cytogenetics and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization for detecting the 'variant' MYC translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 29 samples (51.8%) were t(8;14)-positive by long PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-third had a chromosomal breakpoint in the IgH joining region while the others had breakpoints in the IgH switch regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among them were two cases with a previously unreported MYC translocation into the IgE switch region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long PCR was more reliable compared to conventional cytogenetics for detecting the t(8;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus was detected in high copy number in two (3.6%) t(8;14)-positive cases by real-time quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Human herpesvirus 8 was not detected in any case by nested PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A typical L3 or L3-compatible cytomorphology was highly predictive (&gt;80%) but not specific of a MYC translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 34 patients were treated according to the GMALL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> therapy protocols and there was no significant difference in overall survival between patients with or without t(8;14) </plain></SENT>
