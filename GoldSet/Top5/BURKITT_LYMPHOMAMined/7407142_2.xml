<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A procedure for cellular fractionation and preparation of plasma membrane from a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This procedure involves homogenization with a Polytron in buffered isotonic <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi>, and separation of cellular fractions by differential and isopycnic centrifugation in <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The isolated plasma membrane fraction contains 44% of the cellular cholesterol, 50% of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-sensitive (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> + K+)-ATPase activity, 43% of the gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activities and 16% of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This fraction contains only 3% of cellular protein and is contaminated with less than 4% of the total cellular activities of microsomal, lysosomal, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo>, Golgi and soluble marker enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cholesterol : <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> molar ratio of the crude plasma membrane is 0.56 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The membranes in this fraction are in the form of vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further purification of plasma membrane is achieved by <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> density gradient centrifugation and results in a 25- to 30-fold enrichment of plasma membrane markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma membrane markers band in these gradients between 1.10 and 1.15 g/cm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distribution patterns in the cell fractions of 18 cellular constituents are quantitatively determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most constituents are found to distribute in a fashion consistent with the results obtained in other systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">Thymidine</z:chebi>-5'-phosphodiesterase (phosphodiesterase I), esterase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> diphophatase and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphatase, however, are shown to be poor markers of membrane fractions in this system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination was used to identify several plasma membrane proteins which are exposed at the surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After separation of labeled <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, the predominant labeled protein was identified as the heavy chain of IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Several lesser labeled proteins were observed </plain></SENT>
