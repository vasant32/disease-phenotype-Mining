<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The localization was achieved by counting grains (after autoradiography) over chromosomes in a number of karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The variable region gene probes hybridized in a cluster on a region of the chromosome 2 short arm close to the centromere (2cen leads to p12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This location was confirmed in lymphocytes from a balanced translocation carrier 46XXt (2; 16) (q13; q22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results show that human kappa light chain genes are located in the region of the break point observed in specific chromosomal translocations associated with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
