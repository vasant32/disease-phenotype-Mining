<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A recent addition to the lymphokine network is human IL-10 (hIL-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This novel lymphokine has striking homology to BCRF1 protein, the product of a previously uncharacterized open-reading frame in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, IL-10 expression has been described in several T clones induced with anti-CD3 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>), in monocytes stimulated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS), and in murine B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether human B cells express hIL-10 and, if so, its relationship to EBV and to other B-cell lymphokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied 21 EBV-positive B-cell lines derived from patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 6), American Burkitt's (n = 3), African Burkitt's (n = 5), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoblastoid cell lines (n = 7), in comparison with seven EBV-negative cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines were activated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> promoters <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> and teleocidin and were studied by Northern blot analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that EBV-positive cell lines derived from patients with American Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and especially those from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>, constitutively express large quantities of hIL-10 by Northern blot analysis and ELISA (range, 3,101 to 25,915 pg/mL), and that both teleocidin and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> induce hIL-10 in these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, six of seven EBV-negative cell lines did not express hIL-10 even by RT-PCR, and hIL-10 was not triggered by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> or teleocidin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To assure that the 350 bp amplified by PCR was hIL-10 and not BCRF1, we used PCR primers, which do not amplify a fragment from plasmid templates containing BCRF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cloning and sequencing of the 350 bp product also demonstrated that B-cell IL-10 is identical to hIL-10 from the T-cell clone B21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Correlation of hIL-10 with other B-cell lymphokines secreted by these B-cell lines demonstrated that hIL-10 secretor cell lines also constitutively secrete or can be induced to secrete IL-6, although to a much lesser amount </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since both lymphokines influence B-cell growth and differentiation, we suggest that hIL-10 may contribute to the polyclonal B-cell activation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>hyperglobulinemia</z:hpo> seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, several reports support the hypothesis that EBV is an important cofactor in the development of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus type 1 (HIV-1)-related B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Detection of large quantities of hIL-10 in B-cell lines derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients, the close association between EBV and hIL-10 shown in this report, and the ability of BCRF1 to capture hIL-10 activities, make hIL-10/BCRF1 an attractive candidate as a factor causing B-cell growth and immortalization in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
