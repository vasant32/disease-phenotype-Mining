<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These translocations have been shown to associate predominantly with B-cell diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) and less frequently with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular alterations associated with these translocations involve one of the immunoglobulin gene (Ig) loci and a recently cloned gene, bcl-6 located at 3q27 which codes for a zinc-finger protein that may function as a transcription factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have identified by cytogenetic analysis 22 cases of ML with a 3q27/Ig translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathologic diagnoses</z:e> of these cases include DLCL, FL, small non-cleaved non-Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis confirmed a bcl-6 rearrangement in 10/12 cases tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The karyotype in 5/22 cases revealed the t(3;14) or variant in association with another <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-specific translocation, t(14;18) in three cases and t(8;14) in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ML with dual translocations that implicate Ig genes in the deregulation of proto-oncogenes are being increasingly recognized and may represent distinct subtypes or 'hybrid' forms of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
