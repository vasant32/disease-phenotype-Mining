<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RJ 2.2.5 is a human B cell mutant derived from the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji cell which is defective in the AIR-1 locus function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This locus encodes a transcriptional trans-activator required for the constitutive expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show, by in vivo DNase I footprinting, that the AIR-1 locus defect correlates with changes in the DRA promoter occupancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, reexpression of human MHC class II genes in RJ 2.2.5 x mouse spleen cell hybrids is associated with partial reversion of DRA promoter occupancy to the Raji pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DRA promoter occupancy in other class II-negative B cell lines, derived from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242583" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bare lymphocyte syndrome</z:e>, is drastically different from the one observed in RJ 2.2.5 and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the use of the DNase I as an in vivo footprinting agent reveals that the patients' cell lines do not display a completely "bare promoter" as previously reported using dimethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> as the footprinting agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the use of DNase I allowed us, for the first time, to correlate the AIR-1 locus defect with class II promoter occupancy alterations and distinguish these alterations from the ones observed in phenotypically similar but genetically distinct MHC class II-negative cells </plain></SENT>
