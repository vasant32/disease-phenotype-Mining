<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The chimeric protein consisted of the amino-terminal transactivation domain of E2A linked to the carboxyl-terminal basic region-leucine zipper domain of HLF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLF was normally expressed in liver and kidney, but not in lymphoid cells, and was found to be closely related to the leucine zipper-containing transcription factors <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> (albumin D-box binding protein) and TEF (thyrotroph embryonic factor), which regulate developmental stage-specific gene expression </plain></SENT>
