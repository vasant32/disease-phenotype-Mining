<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fas-associated protein with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> domain (FADD) is an essential adaptor protein in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor-mediated signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During apoptotic signaling, FADD functions in the cytoplasm, where it couples activated receptors with initiator caspase-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in resting cells, FADD is predominantly stored in the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the modalities of FADD intracellular trafficking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that, upon CD95 activation, FADD redistributes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This inducible nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of FADD is independent of CD95 internalization, formation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-inducing signaling complex, and caspase-8 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to nuclear export of FADD, its subsequent recruitment and accumulation at endosomes containing internalized CD95 requires a caspase-8-dependent feedback loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate the existence of differential pathways directing FADD nuclear export and cytoplasmic trafficking, and identify subcellular compartmentalization of FADD as a novel regulatory mechanism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor signaling </plain></SENT>
