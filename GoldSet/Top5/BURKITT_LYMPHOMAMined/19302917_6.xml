<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi> (GPI) anchor deficiency in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified a large GPI anchor protein deficient population in three different Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines through proaerolysin treatment of the cells and flow cytometry analysis using a proaerolysin variant (FLAER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of GPI anchor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein deficiency</z:e> was studied by DNA gene sequencing, a cell-free assay to investigate the GPI anchor biosynthetic pathway, microarray analysis, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines harbor large populations of FLAER(neg) cells, which are resistant to proaerolysin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell lines, silencing of a gene involved in an early step in GPI-anchor biosynthesis was responsible for the lack of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and microarray analysis demonstrate that the level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for PIGL and PIGY is lower in the FLAER(neg) Ramos cells and that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of PIGY are reduced in the Akata and Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of these genes was associated with the low levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and treatment of the cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2' deoxycytidine</z:chebi> restored cell surface GPI-anchored proteins to the FLAER(neg) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: GPI-anchored <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein deficiency</z:e> in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells is not due to a genetic mutation (e.g., PIGA); rather, the lack of GPI-anchored proteins results from transcriptional silencing of PIGL and PIGY </plain></SENT>
