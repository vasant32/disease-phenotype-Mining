<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, both types of agents likewise stimulated phosphorylation of myeloid cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> 1 (MCL1), another viability-promoting BCL2 family member </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, while MCL1 phosphorylation induced by the protein kinase C activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>), did not affect its electrophoretic mobility, microtubule-damaging agents, such as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">taxol</z:chebi>, induced MCL1 phosphorylation associated with a band shift to decreased mobility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation blocked <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-induced MCL1 phosphorylation but not the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">taxol</z:chebi>-induced band shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-induced MCL1 phosphorylation occurred rapidly and was not associated with decreased viability, while the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">taxol</z:chebi>-induced band shift occurred upon extended exposure as cells accumulated in G(2)/M followed by cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitors also induced the MCL1 band shift/phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, MCL1 undergoes two distinct types of phosphorylation: (i) <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-induced, ERK-associated phosphorylation, which does not alter the electrophoretic mobility of MCL1, and (ii) ERK-independent phosphorylation, which results in an MCL1 band shift and is induced by events in G(2)/M or protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitors </plain></SENT>
