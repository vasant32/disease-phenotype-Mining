<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have examined tissue obtained from five renal and one cardiac allograft recipient with Epstein-Barr virus-associated B cell proliferations for immunoglobulin gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsies from two patients with lesions that were hyperplastic morphologically, polyclonal by cellular immunoglobulin staining, and had diploid karyotypes, had no detectable gene rearrangements and were, therefore, consistent with benign reactive processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients are alive without evidence of disease 37 and 57 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a biopsy from one patient with a lesion that was malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> morphologically, monoclonal by cellular immunoglobulin staining, and had clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, clonal gene rearrangements were detected in a majority of cells, confirming their neoplastic nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In biopsies from an intermediate group of three patients with morphologically malignant proliferations that were composed predominantly of a polyclonal population of B cells, clonal gene rearrangements were also found, consistent with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in a subpopulation of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings confirm the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the posttransplant EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e> and have significant implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of EBV-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
