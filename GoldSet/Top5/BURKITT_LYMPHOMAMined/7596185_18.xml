<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine genetic instability on lympho- and myeloproliferative processes, we analyzed the behaviour of 10 microsatellite markers and one VNTR on different chromosomes in 10 patients with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL), one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) and 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mobility shifts were found in three of those cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of them showed genetic instability for several markers--microsatellites and VNTR- and the other two showed differences for only one marker </plain></SENT>
