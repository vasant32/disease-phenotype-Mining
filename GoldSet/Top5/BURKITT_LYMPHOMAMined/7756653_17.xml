<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint of 14q32 translocations found in B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> was delineated specifically in both metaphase spreads and interphase nuclei by double-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using bacteriophage clones containing the human immunoglobulin gamma chain gene locus (Ig gamma) and a cosmid clone, CY24-68, containing VH segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CY24-68 is more telomeric than Ig gamma, separated by approximately 1 megabase (Mb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FISH studies were performed on four patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), one with plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="43" ids="53200">PCL</z:chebi>), and three cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each patient with t(8;14), t(14;18), and t(3;14), the signal of Ig gamma gene was observed on der(14) and that of CY24-68 at respective partner sites of these translocations, 8q24.1, 18q21.3, and 3q27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interphase nuclei with a signal of Ig gamma clearly separated from that of CY24-68 were more frequently encountered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients (45% to 74%) than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (4% to 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even in cases where only interphase nuclei were available for FISH studies, 14q32 translocations are detected as shown in two patients each with NHL and t(11;14)-carrying <z:chebi fb="43" ids="53200">PCL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two cell lines, HS-1 derived from ALL carrying t(8;14) and FR4 derived from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> carrying a complex form of t(8;14), the signal of Ig gamma was observed at the breakpoint region 8q24.1 of the der(8) in addition to the der(14), indicating that translocation event occurred within the Ig gamma locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intense Ig gamma signal was found at the breakpoint region on the der(14)t(11;14) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-2 derived from NHL, indicating amplification of the Ig gamma gene, and presumably the resultant chimeric DNA between Ig gamma and DNA sequences at 11q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present approach allowed us to unequivocally detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific breakpoints of 14q32 translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, interphase FISH provides a rapid diagnostic procedure to detect 14q32 translocations in B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
