<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Animal models have strongly suggested that lymphoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> might have a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following the first report by Ludwig Gross in 1951 of the transmission of mouse <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> by cell-free filtrates inoculated into newborn mice and the subsequent identification of many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-inducing type-C viruses in animals, attention was focused on the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> retroviruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it was work in Africa which led to the recognition of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as an entity and to the discovery of the Epstein-Barr virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many refer to this DNA virus as the first recognized human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The research that these early studies stimulated has resulted in enormous progress in our understanding of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and in highly significant advances in therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More recently, the first human retrovirus was identified and characterized in the laboratory of Dr Robert Gallo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence that this virus, isolated from a patient with a T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, is etiologically associated with a specific type of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> first described in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Africa may be considered the cradle of geographical pathology and the potential for generating unique information on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> etiology and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> control is still enormous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> are excellent models for the study of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, particularly in Africa, since as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> of the immune system, their induction and evolution is strongly influenced by those environmental factors, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and nutrition, which have a profound effect on the immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is good evidence that at least some of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> in this group are associated with specific transforming viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is an immediate need to collect accurate, reproducible and comparable data on the incidence and characteristics of the different types of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and on the populations in which they occur in the various African countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Such data will provide the basis for undertaking simultaneous or subsequent etiological and therapeutic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Realistic approaches to these goals are considered and specific studies relating to questions posed by available information discussed </plain></SENT>
