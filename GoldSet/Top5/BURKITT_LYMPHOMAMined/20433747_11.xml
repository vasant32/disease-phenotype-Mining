<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Myc is a well known driver of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, and Myc-activating chromosomal translocation is the recognized hallmark of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a model that mimics this translocation event by inserting a mouse Myc cDNA gene into the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, just upstream of the intronic Emu enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These mice, designated iMyc E mu, readily develop B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study the mechanism of Myc-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we analyzed signaling pathways in lymphoblastic B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (LBLs) from iMyc E mu mice, and an LBL-derived cell line, iMyc E mu-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were constitutively activated in iMyc E mu mice, not only in LBLs but also in the splenic B-lymphocytes of young animals months before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, inhibition of either transcription factor in iMyc E mu-1 cells suppressed growth and caused <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and the abrogation of NF-kappaB activity reduced DNA binding by both STAT3 and Myc, as well as Myc expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of STAT3 signaling eliminated the activity of both NF-kappaB and Myc, and resulted in a corresponding decrease in the level of Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, in iMyc E mu-1 cells NF-kappaB and STAT3 are co-dependent and can both regulate Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, NF-kappaB and phosphorylated STAT3 were physically associated with one another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, LBLs and iMyc E mu-1 cells also showed constitutive AKT phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blocking AKT activation by inhibiting PI3K reduced iMyc E mu-1 cell proliferation and caused <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, via downregulation of NF-kappaB and STAT3 activity and a reduction of Myc levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Co-treatment with NF-kappaB, STAT3 or/and PI3K inhibitors led to additive inhibition of iMyc E mu-1 cell proliferation, suggesting that these signaling pathways converge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the notion that constitutive activation of NF-kappaB and STAT3 depends on upstream signaling through PI3K, and that this activation is important for cell survival and proliferation, as well as for maintaining the level of Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Together, these data implicate crosstalk among NF-kappaB, STAT3 and PI3K in the development of iMyc E mu B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
