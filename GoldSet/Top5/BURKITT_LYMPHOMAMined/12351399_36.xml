<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that CD47 engagement by CD47 mAb or thrombospondin induced caspase-independent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic leukemic B cells (B-CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that human immature dendritic cells (iDCs) phagocytosed the CD47 mAb-killed leukemic cells in the absence of caspases 3, 7, 8, and 9 activation in the malignant lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Yet the dead cells displayed the cytoplasmic features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, including cell shrinkage, phosphatidylserine exposure, and decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD47 mAb-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> also occurred in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> resting and activated lymphocytes, with B-CLL cells demonstrating the highest susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, iDCs and CD34(+) progenitors were resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Structure-function studies in cell lines transfected with various CD47 chimeras demonstrated that killing exclusively required the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the CD47 molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">Cytochalasin</z:chebi> D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22584">antimycin A</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> electron transfer, completely suppressed CD47-induced phosphatidylserine exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, CD47 ligation failed to induce cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in mononuclear cells isolated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043194" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome</z:e> (WAS) patients, suggesting the involvement of Cdc42/WAS protein (WASP) signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that CD47-induced caspase-independent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> be mediated by cytoskeleton reorganization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This form of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> may be relevant to maintenance of homeostasis and as such might be explored for the development of future therapeutic approaches in lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
