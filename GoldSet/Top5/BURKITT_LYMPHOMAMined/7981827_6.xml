<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The analysis was performed on a 65 cm x 50 microns I.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ucon-coated column with on-column UV detector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method requires only nanoliters of sample and a simple sample preparation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over 12 nucleotides were separated and quantitated with high resolution and reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The whole capillary electrophoretic separation time was only 35 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that capillary electrophoresis provides a useful and easy way to analyze nucleotide pools in cells </plain></SENT>
