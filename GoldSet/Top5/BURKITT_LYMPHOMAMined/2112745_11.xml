<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In many cases, the expression of these molecules appears to be regulated in a similar manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contained within the promoter of the invariant chain gene are sequences (X and I gamma 1) that are similar to the X and Y box elements of class II genes, suggesting that these sequences might be involved in its regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNase I footprinting reveals additional cis-acting elements (I gamma 2 and I gamma 3) that contain sequence similarities to NF-kappa B and/or H2TF1/KBF1 recognition sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A series of fusion constructs with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase reporter gene were used to analyze the role of these sequences (I gamma 1, I gamma 2, I gamma 3, and X and Y elements) in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest the likelihood of multiple X box proteins in B cells, which can act as both negative and positive regulatory factors </plain></SENT>
