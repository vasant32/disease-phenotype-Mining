<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, 8q24 breakpoints from 17 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> involving non-IG loci were mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In seven cases the breakpoint was inside a small region encompassing MYC: in one t(7;8)(p12;q24) and two t(3;8)(q27;q24), it was telomeric to MYC whereas in four cases, one t(2;8)(p15;q24) and three t(8;9)(q24;p13) it was located in a 85 kb region encompassing MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these seven cases, partner regions identified by FISH contained genes known to be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, namely BCL6, BCL11A, PAX5 and IKAROS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Breakpoints were cloned in two t(8;9)(q24;p13), 2.5 and 7 kb downstream from MYC and several hundred kb 5' to PAX5 on chromosome 9, joining MYC to ZCCHC7 and to ZBTB5 exon 2, two genes encoding zinc-finger proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these seven cases, MYC expression measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was significantly higher when compared to that of patients without 8q24 rearrangement (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that these rearrangements are the consequence of a non-random process targeting MYC together with non-IG genes involved in lymphocyte differentiation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
