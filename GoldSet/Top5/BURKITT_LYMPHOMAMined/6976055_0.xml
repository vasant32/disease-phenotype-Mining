<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enlargement of the peripheral lymph nodes was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo> and during the operation the mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes were found to be greatly enlarged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three years after the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> syndrome developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 5 years sudden clinical deterioration appeared, with loss of reaction to effective treatment given as yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversion of the predominating lymphocyte subpopulation from T to B cells was observed owing to repeatedly done monitoring of peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pattern of the newly developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was that of a highly malignant B-cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possible mechanisms of the conversion discussed by the authors include: simultaneous proliferation of B and T populations of lymphocytes, B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> induction by chemotherapy, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by Epstein-Barr virus </plain></SENT>
