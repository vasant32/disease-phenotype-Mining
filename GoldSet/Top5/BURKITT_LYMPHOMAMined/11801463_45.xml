<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Monoclonal antibody IDEC-C2B8 (rituximab) has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate relationships between the efficacy of IDEC-C2B8 and expression of CD20, presence of complement, and effects of differently acting chemotherapeutic agents used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treatment (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, cladribine, bendamustine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: DOHH-2, WSU-NHL and Raji <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and ex vivo cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) (n=17) and leukemic B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n=9) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the effect of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)alpha on expression of CD20 molecules per cell was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrate that 10 mg/mL rituximab saturated 80-95% of CD20 molecules per cell in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although rituximab induced only a minor increase of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, combinations of rituximab with different cytotoxic drugs significantly decreased the IC(30)- and IC(50) dosages of the chemotherapeutic agents necessary for induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> irrespective of addition of complement, demonstrating a chemosensitizing effect of rituximab in combination with cytotoxic drugs in the neoplastic lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect seemed to be independent of the percentage of saturated CD20 molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After addition of caspase inhibitors to the cell lines incubated with rituximab and cytotoxic agents, caspase-7 and -8 were found, by Western blotting, to be the executioner caspases, possibly explaining the rituximab-sensitized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preincubation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with cytokines did not alter the expression of CD20; IL-2 and IL-4 even decreased the rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that rituximab sensitizes <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to the effect of differently acting cytotoxic drugs used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treatment, that this effect does not require complement, and that caspase-7 and -8 may represent the main executioner caspases in chemosensitization by rituximab </plain></SENT>
