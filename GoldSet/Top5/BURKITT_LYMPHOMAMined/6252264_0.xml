<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This induction procedure results in significant levels of EA-D and EA-R positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The serological titres obtained on cell preparations induced with PHA and IUdR were comparable to those obtained on smears prepared by the classical procedure requiring infectious EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This convenient method of induction can replace more cumbersome techniques for routine EBV serology </plain></SENT>
