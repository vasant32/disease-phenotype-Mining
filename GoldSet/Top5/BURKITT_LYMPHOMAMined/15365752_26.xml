<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight children (age range, 2-16 years) underwent multi-station FSE STIR whole-body <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> at initial staging (n=5) or for restaging following completion of therapy (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole-body <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and conventional staging procedures, including CT (n=10), <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi>-67 scintigraphy (n=9), bone scintigraphy (n=3) and bone marrow biopsy (n=7) were retrospectively compared for detection of sites involved by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and for the assigned stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FSE STIR whole-body <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> detected more sites of possible lymphomatous involvement at initial staging (87/88) and at restaging (5/5) than did conventional imaging (74/88, 3/5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> was more sensitive than conventional imaging in detecting bone marrow involvement at initial staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following treatment, however, residual and therapy-induced bone marrow signal abnormalities could not be differentiated from lymphomatous involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detection of nodal and visceral involvement correlated well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that FSE STIR whole-body <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is a sensitive technique for evaluating lymphomatous involvement of bone marrow as well as non-marrow sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Larger prospective trials are needed to determine if FSE STIR whole-body <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> can replace standard radiographic procedures for initial staging and contribute in the follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
