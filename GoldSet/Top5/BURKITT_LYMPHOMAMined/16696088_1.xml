<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The staining patterns generated using the three methods were similar and consistent, although the ASP antibody seemed to be more sensitive and detected higher numbers of apoptotic cells within sections.Conclusions-Pressure cooking is advocated as an alternative method to proteolytic enzyme digestion for pretreating paraffin wax sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is reliable, inexpensive, reduces the need to optimise pretreatment variables for different tissues, and permits double immunostaining of sections </plain></SENT>
