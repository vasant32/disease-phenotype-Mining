<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the time of reporting, actuarial survival was 50% (current actual survival 42%) and the major morbidity and mortality was not from resistant or relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but from complications of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumour lysis syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and early abdominal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> II) reported here was carried out between 1984 and 1986; we used GRAB to treat 24 newly and consecutively diagnosed children with advanced Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but discouraged early 'debulking' surgery and paid special attention to supportive care during the first two weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> I, no radiotherapy was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (83.8%) attained complete remission: 17 (71%), including three of the seven stage IV patients, survive continuously disease-free at a median of 26 months (range 18-36 months) from diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have previously pointed out that GRAB, without radiotherapy, may be especially suited for use in some developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From this study we conclude that, with appropriate supportive care and minimal surgery, survival rates over 50% may be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our next studies are aimed at defining a 'good risk' group of patients, who may be curable without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> and a 'poor risk' group, who need more intensive therapy </plain></SENT>
