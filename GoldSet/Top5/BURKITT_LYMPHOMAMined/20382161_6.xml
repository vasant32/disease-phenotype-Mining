<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bispecific antibodies capable of redirecting the lytic potential of immune effector cells to kill <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> targets have long been recognized as a potentially potent biological therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, efforts to produce such molecules have been limited owing to inefficient production and poor stability properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a novel Fv-derived strategy based on a covalently linked bispecific diabody structure that we term dual-affinity re-targeting (DART) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a model system, we linked an Fv specific for human CD16 (FcgammaRIII) on effector cells to an Fv specific for mouse or human CD32B (FcgammaRIIB), a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> target antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DART proteins were produced at high levels in mammalian cells, retained the binding activity of the respective parental Fv domains as well as bispecific binding, and showed extended storage and serum stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functionally, the DART molecules demonstrated extremely potent, dose-dependent cytotoxicity in retargeting human PBMC against B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines as well as in mediating autologous B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo studies in mice demonstrated effective B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> that was dependent on the transgenic expression of both CD16A on the effector cells and CD32B on the B-cell targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, DART proteins showed potent in vivo protective activity in a human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, DART represents a biologically potent format that provides a versatile platform for generating bispecific antibody fragments for redirected killing and, with the selection of appropriate binding partners, applications outside of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
