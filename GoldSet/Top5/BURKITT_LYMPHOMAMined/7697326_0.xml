<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The morphological classification was based on Working Formulation, the immunological classification--on <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The phenotypes were assayed cytofluorometrically with monoclonal antibodies and compared to ontogenic stages in B and T cell development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Small non-cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Burkitt's type) was seen in 13 patients, lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 12 patients, low differentiated in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunological classification showed B-lymphocyte origin of blast cells in 15 patients including 11 small non-cleaved Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (mature B and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cALL</z:e> phenotype), 3 undifferentiated cases (pro-B and mature B cell) and 1 case of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cALL</z:e> type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T-cell origin of blast cells was demonstrated in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immunological classification used routinely was helpful in selection of patients with unfavourable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The more precise description of blast cells was valuable for better adjustment of therapy and better prognosis </plain></SENT>
