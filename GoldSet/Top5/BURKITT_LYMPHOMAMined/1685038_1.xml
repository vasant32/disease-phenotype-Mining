<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied four cases of fatal B-cell lymphoproliferative syndrome (LPS) developing among 333 patients (incidence 1.2%) treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients had received a T-cell depleted graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> of the first clinical symptoms (palpable lymph node enlargement in three and IgA-lambda <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030489" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paraproteinemia</z:e> in two patients) occurred between 41 and 188 days post-BMT (median 76 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The course of the LPS was <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 2-5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blood showed progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> with disproportionally high numbers of activated NK cells, apparently compensating for the <z:mp ids='MP_0001831'>T-cell deficiency</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-mortem histological studies disclosed polymorphic B-cell proliferations, most pronounced in the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, lungs and kidneys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lymphohemopoietic cells were of donor origin in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the fourth patient, graft failure suggested a host origin for the proliferating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotyping and gene rearrangement analysis revealed polyclonal proliferation in one patient, monoclonal proliferation in another patient, and an oligoclonal pattern in the other two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical behavior of the LPS was independent of clonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistologically, the proliferating cells showed characteristics of relatively mature B-cells in three cases, and pre-B-cell features in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Epstein Barr virus (EBV) serology indicated seroconversion (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary infection</z:e>) in one child, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in both adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>EBV DNA as well as EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) were detected in infiltrated tissues of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The labeling pattern on in situ hybridization suggested a replicative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> comparable to that in lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that EBV-associated LPS developing as a result of post-transplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> is a distinct clinicopathologic entity, differing from non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (including Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> of the immunocompetent host </plain></SENT>
