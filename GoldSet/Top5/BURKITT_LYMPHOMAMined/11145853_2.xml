<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated effect of interleukin (IL-)15 on modulation of type 1/type 2 balance in addition to non-major histo-compatibility complex (MHC)-restricted killer induction in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-growing site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IL-15 induced significant killer activity in mononuclear cells (MNC) in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> as well as those in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pleural MNC produced more IFN-gamma (type 1 cytokine) by incubation with IL-15 or IL-2 than blood MNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, IL-4 and IL-5 (type 2 cytokines) production by pleural MNC were observed only by incubation with IL-2, but not with IL-15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that IL-15 has a potent activity to restore type 1/type 2 balance in addition to killer induction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-growing site </plain></SENT>
