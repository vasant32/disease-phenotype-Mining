<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (Daudi, Namalwa, Raji and Ramos cells) were cultured in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory rate of cell proliferation was detected by XTT assay, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of cells was determined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of BCL-2 in human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (Daudi, Namalwa, Raji and Ramos cells) treated with rituximab (20 microg/ml) for 24 hours was analyzed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the anti-CD20 McAb had a slight anti-proliferation effect on the Daudi, Namalwa, Raji cell lines and no effect on the Ramos cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is no correlation between the effect and the concentration of anti-CD20 McAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-CD20 McAb as a single agent could weakly induce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of four cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory rate of cell proliferation ranged from 3% to 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of BCL-2 protein was down-regulated after treated by anti-CD20 McAb for 24 hours in Raji and Namalwa cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the anti-CD20 McAb as a monomer can slightly inhibit the proliferation of Daudi, Namalwa and Raji cell lines, the inhibition does not dependent on the treating time and the concentrations of anti-CD20 McAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-CD20 McAb as a monomer can weakly induce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of four cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression of BCL-2 in Raji and Namalwa cell lines is down-regulated after the cells were treated by anti-CD20 McAb for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of BCL-2 expression may be one of the mechanisms enhancing the cytotoxicity of cytotoxic drugs </plain></SENT>
