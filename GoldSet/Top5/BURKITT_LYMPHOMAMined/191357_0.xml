<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight marmosets inoculated with P3 virus (10(9) particles) and seven marmosets inoculated with 10(5) infectious units of HR-1 virus likewise developed no recognizable clinical or haematological disease over several years of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen marmosets were inoculated with 10(2)-10(4) transforming units (TFU) of EBV strain B95-8; five of 11 animals inoculated with 10(3)-10(4) TFU of virus developed malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and died 31-110 days PI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to one or more EBV-specified antigens were detected in sera from nine of the inoculated marmosets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBV-carrying lymphoblastoid cell cultures were established from the spleen and lymph-nodes of one animal that died with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and from another animal that died 19 days PI from undetermined causes </plain></SENT>
