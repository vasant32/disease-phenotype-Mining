<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, scientific data, reported in 1959 by Kr√∂ning, show the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598798" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoid tumours</z:e> in C57 B1 mice after exposure of their skin to squalen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These observations rose the question of a possible mutagenic power of shark liver oil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the genotoxicity of these oils, in vitro assays have been performed on crude hepatic oil of three species of mediterranean sharks: two benthic sharks, Centrophorus granulosus and Galeus melastomus, and one pelagic specie, Prionace glauca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotoxicity of oils have been assayed using a micronucleus test which can detected simultaneously clastogen and aneugen effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incubation of human cells with the hepatic crude oils of Centrophorus granulosus increases the rate of the binucleated micronucleated cell in a dose dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean micronucleated cell rate was 9.0%. +/- 1.1 in controls and increased up to 27,1%. +/- 4,0 for the highest concentrations of oil extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results have been obtained with crude hepatic oils of Galeus melastomus and Prionace glauca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this experimental study show that the crude liver oils of three species of sharks are genotoxic and confirm a high carcinogenic risk </plain></SENT>
