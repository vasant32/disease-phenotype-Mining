<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The factor synergizes with higher molecular mass autocrine growth factors and makes both BA-D10-4 cells and B cell lines from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but not cells from T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, more responsive to interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this low molecular mass factor seems to be an autocrine growth factor per se and to have the characteristics of a competence factor </plain></SENT>
