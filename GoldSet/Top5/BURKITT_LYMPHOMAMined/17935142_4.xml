<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic Reed-Sternberg cells characteristic of classical Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (cHL) are of B-cell origin but they almost always show striking loss of a range of B-cell-associated molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the neoplastic cells found in lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LPHL) (L&amp;H cells) are traditionally thought of as possessing the full repertoire of features associated with germinal centre B cells (eg BCL-6 expression, 'ongoing' Ig gene mutation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, we report an extensive phenotypic analysis of L&amp;H cells which revealed down-regulation of a number of markers associated with the B-cell lineage (eg CD19, CD37) and with the germinal centre maturation stage (eg PAG, LCK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The promoter methylation status of three of these down-regulated genes (CD10, CD19, and LCK) was further studied in microdissected L&amp;H cells, and this revealed that their promoters were unmethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, these genes showed promoter methylation in cell lines derived from CHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of the mechanisms responsible for the deregulation of these molecules in L&amp;H cells may provide new insights into the genetic abnormalities underlying LPHL </plain></SENT>
