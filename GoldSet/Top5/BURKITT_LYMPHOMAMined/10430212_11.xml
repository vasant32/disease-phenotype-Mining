<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data were abstracted from medical records in 89 hospitals and clinics in nine U.S. cities from January 1994 through June 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic was used to test for trend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 19,684 HIV-infected persons representing 26,638 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Decreases in incidence per 1000 person-years were observed for KS (January through June 1994, 49.9; January through June 1997, 25.7; p = .001) and PBL (January through June 1994, 8.0; January through June 1997, 2.3; p = .01), especially during time on antiretroviral therapy, but changes in the incidence of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the study, prescription of combination antiretroviral therapy increased from 16% to 57% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidences of KS and PBL are decreasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although for KS the decline occurred in both treated and untreated groups (difference in rate of decline not significant, p = .08), it was sharper in the treated group; additionally, KS declined faster in the era after highly active antiretroviral agents were introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, these decreases may be due in part to the effect of antiretroviral therapy slowing the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
