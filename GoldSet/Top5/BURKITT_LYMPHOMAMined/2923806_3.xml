<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of mammalian cells requires <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleosides</z:chebi> which are provided either by de novo synthesis or by influx of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleosides</z:chebi> via membrane transporters with subsequent metabolic trapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the density of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> transporters in freshly-isolated blast cells from patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was quantitated by equilibrium binding of 3H-nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (NBMPR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) the density of NBMPR binding sites on blast cells ranged from 3800 to 24,200 sites/cell and this value correlated with the 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> labelling index (1-20%) which was used to measure proliferative rate (r = 0.80, P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells from patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, T-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> gave a 20-fold range of NBMPR site densities (from 3700 to 75,300 sites/cell) and site numbers correlated closely with the labelling index (r = 0.87, P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of bone marrow and peripheral blood blasts confirmed the positive correlation between NBMPR binding sites and labelling index for four individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the density of NBMPR binding sites on lymphoblasts from non-T <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) was low (2300-7400 sites/cell) and showed little dependence on proliferation over a wide range of labelling indices (1-20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation was observed between NBMPR site density and cell size measured by the intracellular water space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus an increased proliferative rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is associated with higher numbers of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> transporters in the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
