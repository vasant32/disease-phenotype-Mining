<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because this translocation is difficult to detect using standard cytogenetic techniques, 27 previously karyotyped B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cell lines were evaluated for the presence of the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 fusion using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and cDNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six cell lines expressed the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 chimeric transcript by RT-PCR and the t(12;21) was confirmed by FISH analysis with probes for <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>, AML1, and chromosome 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While only one of the 6 cell lines with the t(12;21) lost the der(12)t(12;21)-encoded AML1-<z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> fusion transcript, 4 cell lines lacked expression of the nontranslocated allele of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> and 5 cell lines lacked expression of CDKN2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in 2 patients (1 with the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 transcript and 1 without), <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> expression was lost with disease progression; le, <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> was expressed in the initial cell lines (established at diagnosis or first relapse) whereas <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> was not expressed in the cell lines established from these patients in late-stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data show the coexistence of multiple genetic defects in childhood B-lineage ALL Cell lines with t(12;21) will facilitate the study of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 and AML1-<z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> fusion proteins as well as <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> and CDKN2 gene inactivation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> transformation and progression </plain></SENT>
