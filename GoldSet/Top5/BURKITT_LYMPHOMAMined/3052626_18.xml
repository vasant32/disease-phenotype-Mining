<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 33 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> who received grafts from HLA-identical donors, three patients with ANLL received transplants in first remission and one patient with standard-risk ALL received a graft while in second remission </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3-year actuarial disease-free survival rate of 56.6% +/- 9.7% (SE) and the actuarial relapse rate of 11.9% +/- 6.8% (SE) demonstrate that the combination of fractionated total body irradiation and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP 16</z:chebi> is an effective mode of therapy in patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preliminary experience cautions against the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP 16</z:chebi> instead of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> in any clinical situation carrying an increased risk of graft rejection because the immunosuppressive potency of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP 16</z:chebi> is largely untested but may be inferior to that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
