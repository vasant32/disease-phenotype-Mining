<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent attempts at laparoscopic reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> at our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CFS</z:e> distraction technique was consistently applied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age was 2.4 years (range, 4 months to 10.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indications for surgery included (1) failed pneumatic reduction (n=11), (2) need to evaluate for lead point in a patient with 4 recurrences (n=1), (3) need to biopsy the lead point in a patient with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=1), and (4) diagnostic laparoscopy for evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>hematochezia</z:hpo> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients who failed laparoscopic reduction by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CFS</z:e> distraction technique also failed open manual reduction, requiring right hemicolectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 (86%) who were successfully reduced laparoscopically, pathologic lead points were identified in 5 (2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">appendicitis</z:e>, 1 Meckel's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_68'>diverticulum</z:mpath>, 1 harmatomatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>, and 1 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lead points were excised laparoscopically or via a vertical transumbilical incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CFS</z:e> distraction technique is effective and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lead points may be dealt with together either laparoscopically or via a transumbilical incision </plain></SENT>
