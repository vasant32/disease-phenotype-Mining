<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is mainly due to an impaired function of the accessory cells rather than the T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we tried to define a missing accessory signal for T cell activation in hemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We substituted cell surface bound molecules by adding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines to the in vitro assays that express different patterns of accessory molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell lines that express the costimulatory B7 molecule reconstituted the activation of patients' cells whereas B7 negative cells did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reconstitution was also achieved using mouse fibroblasts transfected with human B7 or by monoclonal antibodies that stimulate the B7 ligand CD28 on T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data further emphasize that impaired leukocyte function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> is due to an accessory cell defect, and that T cells of these patients have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> functional capacities when they get the costimulatory signals required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that it is the B7/CD28 pathway that reconstitutes cellular functions in the patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
