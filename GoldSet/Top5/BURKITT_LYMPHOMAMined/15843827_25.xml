<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immortalized cell lines with such aberrations are today widely used to model different aspects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using cDNA microarrays, we determined the gene expression profiles of 40 cell lines as well as of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> harboring 11q23/MLL rearrangements, t(1;19)[TCF3/PBX1], t(12;21)[ETV6/RUNX1], t(8;21)[RUNX1/CBFA2T1], t(8;14)[IGH@/MYC], t(8;14)[TRA@/MYC], t(9;22)[BCR/ABL1], t(10;11)[PICALM/MLLT10], t(15;17)[PML/RARA], or inv(16)[CBFB/MYH11] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unsupervised classification revealed that hematopoietic cell lines of diverse origin, but with the same primary genetic changes, segregated together, suggesting that pathogenetically important regulatory networks remain conserved despite numerous passages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> cosegregated with cell lines carrying identical genetic rearrangements, further supporting that critical regulatory pathways remain intact in hematopoietic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional signatures correlating with clinical subtypes/primary genetic changes were identified and annotated based on their biological/molecular properties and chromosomal localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the expression profile of tyrosine kinase-encoding genes was investigated, identifying several differentially expressed members, segregating with primary genetic changes, which may be targeted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The identified conserved signatures are likely to reflect regulatory networks of importance for the transforming abilities of the primary genetic changes and offer important pathogenetic insights as well as a number of targets for future rational drug design </plain></SENT>
