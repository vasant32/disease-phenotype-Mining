<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently EBV has been implicated in other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, as well as in some nonlymphomatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027671" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic processes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its possible association with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> has been investigated here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA from 91 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> and blood samples from the same patients were amplified with the PCR over a region in the EBV BamHIW major repeat sequence following a single-step amplification protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen samples (21%) were found to be positive; 10 samples of blood (only 3 of them from patients with EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>) were found by the adopted protocol to contain EBV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another series of PCR amplifications using primers covering a unique (nonreiterated) fragment in BamHIC encoding the EBERs (two short nonpolyadenylated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> generally highly expressed in cells latently infected with EBV) confirmed these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A good correlation between the two sets of experiments was observed, and only five differences in results were obtained on samples tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization was carried out using BamHIW biotinylated DNA probes or EBER-1 digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes with the aim of confirming as well as localizing the signal to the epithelial cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve sections (63%) among the PCR-positive samples were found positive by in situ hybridization with the DNA probe, and six (31.5%) sections were found with the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346156" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">benign breast tumors</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> breast tissue were used as controls for PCR amplification in this study, none of which was found positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first known report showing positive results for EBV in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No statistical association was found in these studies between the presence of EBV and the histological type of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Its role therefore remains for the moment unknown, as well as does the significance of the association of EBV with only a subset of the cases </plain></SENT>
