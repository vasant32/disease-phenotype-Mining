<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patterns of expression in the cells were compared with conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, genotype, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> immunophenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patterns of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> expression were found for each of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types analyzed (5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (ALL), 5 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (CLL), and 3 diffuse poorly differentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DPDL), 7 diffuse histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DHL), and 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myelomas</z:hpo> (MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GM3 was the predominant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> except <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> where GM2 was equivalent to GM3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GM1 was detected by ITLC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, but significant amounts were found by HPTLC only in ALL, CLL, and DHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small amounts of GD3 and GD2 were found in several B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant amounts of other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">gangliosides</z:chebi> were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of GM2 on the MM cell lines, a cell type derived from outside of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, is unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This high level of expression was also seen in metabolic labeling studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GM2 was readily detectable in the SKMM1 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> cell line by flow cytometry and served as a target for human complement-mediated cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the functions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">gangliosides</z:chebi> are largely known, the patterns of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">gangliosides</z:chebi> found for this system of human B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> may serve to provide targets for specific immunotherapy and clues to their functions </plain></SENT>
