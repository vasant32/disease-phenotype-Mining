<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the methylation status of three <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> promoters (Wp, Cp, Qp) from EBV B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) by pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our pyrosequencing data showed that the CpG region of Wp was methylated, but the others were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Wp methylation was increased with proliferation of LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Wp methylation was as high as 74.9% in late-passage LCLs, but 25.6% in early-passage LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From two Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, Wp specific hypermethylation was also found (&gt;80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the expression of EBNA2 gene which located directly next to Wp was associated with its methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggested that Wp specific methylation may be important for the indicator of the proliferation status of LCLs, and the epigenetic <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene regulation of EBNA2 gene by Wp should be further defined possibly with other biological processes </plain></SENT>
