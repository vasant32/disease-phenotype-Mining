<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To account for the superior prognosis of hyperdiploid, B-progenitor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), we investigated the influence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> in 1021 children greater than or equal to 1 year old by recursive partitioning analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated according to a stratified, randomized study testing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolite</z:chebi>-based therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomies</z:mp> of several individual chromosomes were associated with a better prognosis in a univariate statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of greater importance, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of both chromosomes 4 and 10 identified a subgroup of patients (n = 180) with an extremely favorable 4-year event-free survival (EFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combined <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of chromosomes 4 and 10 retained its prognostic significance after stratification of patients by DNA index, age, and leukocyte count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients with a DNA index greater than 1.16, patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> of both chromosomes 4 and 10 had a 4-year EFS of 96.6% (n = 161, SE = 3.8%), whereas patients with neither or only one of these <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> had a 4-year EFS of 70.4% (n = 73, SE = 11.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 19 patients with a DNA index less than or equal to 1.16 but with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> of chromosomes 4 and 10 remain in remission, suggesting that favorable chromosome <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> dominates in a situation in which the cellular DNA content of less than or equal to 1.16 predicts a less favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that combined <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of chromosomes 4 and 10 independently predicts EFS among children with B-progenitor ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients within the B-progenitor group who have this feature (about 20% of those with clonal abnormalities) are likely to be cured with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolite</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy--an approach that should produce few significant late effects </plain></SENT>
