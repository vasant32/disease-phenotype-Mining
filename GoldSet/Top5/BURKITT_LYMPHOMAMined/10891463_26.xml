<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, patients achieving remission are at risk of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the effect of the antiangiogenic drug endostatin used alone and after the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>) or the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, we generated a new model of human NHL by transplanting Namalwa cells intraperitoneally into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, we determined the most effective treatment schedule for the drugs assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When administered alone, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> (3 courses of 75 mg/kg of body weight given intraperitoneally), rituximab (3 courses of 25 mg/kg given intraperitoneally), and endostatin (5 courses of 50 microg given subcutaneously) delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> was the most effective in controlling bulky disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When given after chemotherapy or immunotherapy, endostatin effectively induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When mice given <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> or rituximab on days 3, 5, and 7 after transplantation were randomly assigned to receive endostatin or phosphate-buffered saline on days 15 to 19, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> was prevented in endostatin-treated mice as long as the drug was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, administration of endostatin on days 25 to 29 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> regrowth still induced significant <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp>, whereas <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> and rituximab were not effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The specific antiangiogenic action of endostatin was confirmed by in vitro and in vivo studies indicating that the drug inhibited proliferation and induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of endothelial (but not of NHL) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, sequential administration of chemotherapy and endostatin seems promising for treating bulky NHL, and the less toxic sequential administration of rituximab and endostatin is promising for treating limited disease </plain></SENT>
