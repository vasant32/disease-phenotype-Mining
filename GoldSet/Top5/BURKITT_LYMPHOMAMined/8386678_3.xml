<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Much less homology between rNLR and BLR1 was observed at the N-terminus (about 40%), whereas rNLR and the mouse homologue mNLR show 92% amino acid identity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis of NLR revealed a predominant 5.5 kb <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species in various brain regions and neuronal cell lines, whereas in the spleen a 3 kb transcript is predominant </plain></SENT>
