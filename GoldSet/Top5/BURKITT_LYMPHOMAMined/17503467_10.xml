<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human PVT-1 gene is located on chromosome 8 telomeric to the c-Myc gene and it is frequently involved in the translocations occurring in variant Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that PVT-1 regulates c-Myc gene transcription over a long distance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To get new insights into the functional relationships between the two genes, we have investigated PVT-1 and c-Myc expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human tissues and in transformed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that PVT-1 expression is restricted to a relative low number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues compared to the wide distribution of c-Myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, whereas the gene is highly expressed in many transformed cell types including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells that do not express c-Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reporter gene assays were used to dissect the PVT-1 promoter and to identify the region responsible for the elevated expression observed in transformed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This region contains two putative binding sites for Myc proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of transfection experiments in RAT1-MycER cells and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in proliferating and differentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells indicate that PVT-1 is a downstream target of Myc proteins </plain></SENT>
