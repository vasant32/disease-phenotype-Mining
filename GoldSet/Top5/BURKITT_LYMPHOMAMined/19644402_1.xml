<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to define the epidemiologic and clinical features of <z:mp ids='MP_0009481'>typhlitis</z:mp> and to elucidate predisposing factors for its development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The medical records of pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> who were diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0009481'>typhlitis</z:mp> from 1995 to 2005 were reviewed for clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with a group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> but without <z:mp ids='MP_0009481'>typhlitis</z:mp> who were hospitalized during the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 843 cancer patients, 42 (5%) had episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0009481'>typhlitis</z:mp>; 32 of them (76%) were being treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence was highest in patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (15%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Work-up included abdominal x-ray in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography were performed in 23% and 11% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No cases were missed by plain x-ray when compared with computed tomography and ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0009481'>typhlitis</z:mp> was treated without surgery and survival was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, mucositis [odds ratio (OR) = 30.7], stem cell transplantation (OR = 58.9), and receipt of chemotherapy in the previous 2 weeks (OR = 12.9) were significantly associated with the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009481'>typhlitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that most children with <z:mp ids='MP_0009481'>typhlitis</z:mp> may be treated without surgery in most cases with favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A high index of suspicion may be warranted in patients after stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy and patients with mucositis </plain></SENT>
