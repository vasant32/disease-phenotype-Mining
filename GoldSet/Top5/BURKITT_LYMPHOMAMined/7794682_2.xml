<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results have indicated that PIC isoform beta 1, mainly detectable in the nucleus, undergoes transient modifications early after interferon treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PIC delta 1 has been found only at cytoplasmic level, apparently insensitive to interferon treatment, while PIC gamma 1 was scarcely or not detected either in the cytoplasmic or in the nuclear compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that interferon may exert its antiproliferative effect activating at least two distinct pathways of signal transduction, at cytoplasmic and nuclear level, involving <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> cycle mainly in the nucleus by modulation of PIC beta 1 expression </plain></SENT>
