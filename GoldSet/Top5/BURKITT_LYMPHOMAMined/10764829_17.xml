<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been well established that Galectin-1 (GAL1), a beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24163">galactoside</z:chebi>-binding protein, regulates the viability of lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the signaling pathway governed by the binding of GAL1 to the cell membrane is not understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a first step towards the elucidation of GAL1-initiated signaling events leading to a <z:mp ids='MP_0010831'>reduced viability</z:mp> of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cells, we tried to characterize the initial events induced by the binding of GAL1 to its receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This characterization was performed in BL36 cells, a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line sensitive to GAL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were as follows: (1) when solubilized cell membrane lysates were affinity bound to immobilized GAL1 and eluted by competition, the tyrosine phosphatase glyco-protein CD45 was found in the eluate, highlighting the role of CD45 as a receptor of GAL1; (2) the phosphatase activity of cell membranes diminished after incubation with GAL1; (3) immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the phosphotyrosine kinase Lyn was dysregulated in cells that have been cultured in medium containing 700 nM GAL1, and (4) that the ratio between two isoforms of Lyn was modified during the treatment with GAL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The regulation of Lyn therefore seems to be a key event in the action of GAL1 </plain></SENT>
