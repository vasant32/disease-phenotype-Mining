<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A novel autonomous bio-barcode DNA machine that is driven by template-dependent DNA replication is developed to exponentially amplify special DNA sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Combined with a DNA aptamer recognition element, the DNA machine can be further applied in the aptamer-based, amplified analysis of small molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a model analyte, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) is determined by using the DNA machine system in combination with a DNA aptamer recognition strategy and differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under the optimum conditions, detection limits as low as 2.8×10(-17) M (3σ) for target DNA and 4.7×10(-9) M (3σ) for ATP are achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The satisfactory determination of ATP in K562 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell and Ramos Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell reveal that this protocol possesses good selectivity and practicality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a promising biomolecular device, this DNA machine may have an even broader application in the rapidly developing field of nanobiotechnology </plain></SENT>
