<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of examination and treatment were analyzed in 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (14 men and 6 women aged 15 to 57 years (median age 24 years)) who had been followed up for renal lesion at the Hematology Research Center (HRC) in 2003 to 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When admitted to hospital, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients were found to have ureteric compression, renal parenchymal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> infiltration, massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cytolysis syndrome (MTCS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polychemotherapy (PCT) was performed in accordance with the original intensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-M-04 protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of the process was estimated according to the classification developed by S.B.Murphy: L3 variant B of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> in 10 cases; Stage IV in 2; Stage III in 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>Acute renal failure</z:hpo> (ARF) was identified in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A control group comprised 36 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> without ARF who had been followed up at the HRC in 2003 to 2011 and included into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-M-04 protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio of patients with bone marrow lesion was 7:13 and 9:36 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> + ARF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-ARF groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Decreased urine specific gravity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> (0.4 to 1.3 g/l) were the first manifestations of renal lesion and were seen in approximately 50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases both on admission to hospital and in the first stages of PCT (10 and 9, 8 and 7 of the 20 cases, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002907'>Microhematuria</z:hpo> more commonly developed after initiation of PCT (7 and 3 of the 20 cases, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ARF was diagnosed in 13 patients (24% of the 55 BL patients followed up at HRC in 2003 to 2011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One female patient developed ARF after the start of PCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients developed this condition at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease; in 4 patients, ARF existing prior to PCT began progressing after drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The etiology of ARF was generally mixed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease, MTCS (n = 6) and specific renal parenchymal infiltration (n=6) were more common causes of ARF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Postrenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100519'>anuria</z:hpo> was present in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>ARF after PCT initiation resulted from the toxic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and MTCS (3 and 4 cases, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>ARF regressed in the early periods: in the prophase (n = 4) and during or the first PCT block A (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients with ARF, as compared to those without the latter, showed a statistically significant earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of myelotoxic <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> (MTA): on day 3 of an intercourse interval (95 CI from 0 to 3 days) versus its day 5 (95% CI from 2 to 5 days) and a statistically significant longer duration of MTA--12 days (95% CI from 7 to 16 days) versus 7 days (95% Cl from 3 to 10 days); they were observed to have more severe mucositis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Despite the longer intercourse interval, 10 patients with ARF achieved remission; 4 patients died from therapy-refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and 1 patient from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In the patients with ARF, mortality rates were significantly higher than in those without ARF (33% versus 10%; p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although there is a high risk of worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, PCT is a necessary condition for ARF resolution in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
