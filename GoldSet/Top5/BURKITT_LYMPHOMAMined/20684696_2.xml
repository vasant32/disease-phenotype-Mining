<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>Intussusception</z:hpo> is a common gastrointestinal emergency in children and appears to have a somewhat different clinical spectrum in developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its etiology is still unclear, but a link to infective agents and viruses has been highlighted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the clinical spectrum and prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> in children from the diverse South African population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective data were obtained from 9 participating pediatric referral units on the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> in South African children (&lt;14 years old) during a 6-year period (1998-2003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were correlated with national population statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>Intussusception</z:hpo> was anatomically classified into ileoileal, ileocolic, and colocolic types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical features, management, outcome, and possible causes were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We reviewed the occurrence and clinical spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> in 423 children (age, 0-14 years) presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> to 9 pediatric surgical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of symptoms was 1.5 days, but a delayed presentation was common (median delay, 2.3 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>Intussusception</z:hpo> occurred throughout the year, with a peak in the summer months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (89%) were &lt;2 years old, and 78% presented at age 3-18 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Crude population estimates indicate an occurrence of 1 case per 3123 population &lt;2 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only 11% of patients presented after 2 years of age, and the age at presentation was significantly lower (P &lt; .05) in black African patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ethnic groups were affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 84% of patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> occurred at the ileocolic region junction, in 7% it was ileoileal, and in 9% it was colocolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Colocolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> appeared more common in black African patients, and associated pathologic conditions (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) occurred mainly in older children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Surgical intervention was required in 81% of patients and involved resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gangrenous</z:e> bowel in 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>Intussusception</z:hpo> appears to be a relatively frequent occurrence in children in South Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Although the clinical spectrum appears to vary, there is an apparent link to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178238" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal infection</z:e>, which requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A collaborative approach is required to ascertain the relationship of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> to preventable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and to improve its diagnosis and management </plain></SENT>
