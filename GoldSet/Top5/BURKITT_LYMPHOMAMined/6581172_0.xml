<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-T (OKT3), anti-mu-chain, anti-CALLA (J5), anti-BA-1, anti-BA-2, and anti-nonlymphoid (Mol) monoclonal antibodies were covalently conjugated to <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> latex microspheres (immunolatex), using a two-step glutaraldehyde reaction, and subsequently incubated with the various cell types </plain></SENT>
