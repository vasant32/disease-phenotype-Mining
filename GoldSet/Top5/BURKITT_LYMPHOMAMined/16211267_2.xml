<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We were interested in examining the temporal regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation following CD40 cross-linking of anti-IgM-triggered Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial up-regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation triggered by BCR cross-linking is followed by tyrosine dephosphorylation after 12 h of stimulation, coinciding with pro-caspase-3 processing and PARP cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We find that CD40 co-stimulation rescues BCR-triggered Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells only before the irreversible inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity after 12 h of BCR cross-linking and that this is coupled with up-regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation; thus demonstrating the importance of the late regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation for CD40-mediated rescue of Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells from BCR-triggered G1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
