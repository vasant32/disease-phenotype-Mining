<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with variable-region and joining-region specific primers it is possible to detect the rearrangement of a small amount of clonal B cells, as described by several groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The specific PCR product can be detected after amplification with gel electrophoresis and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4883">ethidium bromide</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DNA fragments obtained from different clones are, however, approximately of the same size, making it difficult to distinguish between the clones by simple electrophoresis and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4883">ethidium bromide</z:chebi> staining, as described in many reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) was evaluated as a method to detect specific clonal amplicons in a mixture of PCR-amplified products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unique patterns were obtained for different B-cell clones, detectable in mixtures of 0.25% clonal cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that SSCP is a valuable method for the specificity control of PCR in B-lymphocyte clonality analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The advantages of the described method over previously published techniques are increased specificity, simplicity without radioactivity, and rapidity </plain></SENT>
