<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic replication is initiated by the immediate-early protein Zta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Zta is a multifunctional DNA binding protein that stimulates <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene transcription, nucleates a replication complex at the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> origin of lytic replication, and inhibits cell cycle proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To better understand these functions and identify cellular collaborators of Zta, we purified an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>-tagged version of Zta in cells capable of supporting lytic replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FLAG-tagged Zta was purified from a nuclear fraction using FLAG antibody immunopurification and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> elution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Zta-associated proteins were isolated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and identified by mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Zta-associated proteins included members of the HSP70 family and various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> binding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nuclear replication protein A subunits (RPA70 and RPA32) and the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi> binding protein (mtSSB) were confirmed by Western blotting to be specifically enriched in the FLAG-Zta immunopurified complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>mtSSB coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous Zta during reactivation of EBV-positive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of mtSSB reduced Zta-induced lytic replication of EBV but had only a modest effect on transcription activation function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A point mutation in the Zta DNA binding domain (C189S), which is known to reduce lytic cycle replication, eliminated mtSSB association with Zta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The predominantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> localization of mtSSB was shifted to partly nuclear localization in cells expressing Zta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA synthesis and genome copy number were reduced by Zta-induced EBV lytic replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that Zta interaction with mtSSB serves the dual function of facilitating <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and blocking <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA replication </plain></SENT>
