<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The electromagnetic field, pulsating at very low frequency, did not affect DNA synthesis in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> culture media nor did it alter its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-inhibition, but it partially reversed the ATP-inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In spite of the presence of ATP, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> prevented stimulation of ATPase and DNA synthesis by the field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although no mechanism is known for the action of either ATP or the field, the results may be interpreted in light of existing speculations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the absence of the field, external ATP may go into an ATP pool that either blocks ATPase or feeds adenyl cyclase, which hinders DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the electromagnetic field may either turn off adenyl cyclase or simply stimulate the ATP-depressed ATPase </plain></SENT>
