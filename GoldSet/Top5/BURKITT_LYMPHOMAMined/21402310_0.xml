<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Tygerberg <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Study Group was constituted in 2007 to quantify the impact of HIV on the pattern and burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases in the Western Cape of South Africa which currently has an HIV prevalence of 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>South Africa has had an Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) policy and a roll-out plan since 2004 attaining 31% effective coverage in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study is designed to qualify and establish the impact of HIV epidemic and the ARV roll-out treatment program on the incidence of HIV Related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (HRL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early data document that despite the ART roll out, cases of HRL are increasing in this geographical location, now accounting for 37% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> seen in 2009 which is an increase from 5% in 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to trends seen in developed environments following the introduction of ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also noted are the emergence of subtypes not previously seen in this location such as Burkitt and plasmablastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is now the commonest HRL seen in this population followed by diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reasons for this observed increase in HRL are not ascribable to improved diagnostic capacity as the tertiary institute in which these diagnoses are made has had significant expertise in this regard for over a decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We ascribe this paradoxical finding to an ART treatment environment that is ineffective for a diversity of reasons, paramount of which are poor coverage, late commencement of ART and incomplete <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> suppression </plain></SENT>
