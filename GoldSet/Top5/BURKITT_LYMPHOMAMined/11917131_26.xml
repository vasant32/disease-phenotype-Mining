<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lymphoblastoid cell lines, generated by immortalization of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in vitro, have strong antigen-presenting capacity, are sensitive to EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells, and are highly allostimulatory in mixed lymphocyte culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By contrast, EBV-positive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells are poor antigen presenters, are not recognized by EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells, and are poorly allostimulatory, which raises the question of whether immunological pressure exerted during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> pathogenesis in vivo has selected for a 'nonimmunogenic' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present work addresses this question by examining the immunogenicity/antigenicity of cell lines, generated by conversion of a conditionally immortalized lymphoblastoid cell line to permanent growth independent of EBV-latent proteins by introduction of a constitutively active or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-regulated c-myc gene (A1 and P493-6 cells, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with its parental lymphoblastoid cell line, A1 cells showed many of the features of the nonimmunogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> phenotype, namely poor allostimulatory activity, poor antigen-presenting function associated with impaired proteasomal activity, down-regulation of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> transporter, reduced HLA class I expression, and an inability to present endogenously expressed EBV-latent proteins to cytotoxic T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>P493-6 cells, when grown in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> with the exogenous c-myc gene switched off, were strongly immunogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cells had lost their immunogenic potential, however, when grown on a c-myc-driven proliferation program in the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deregulation of c-myc, a step central to the development of uncontrolled <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell growth in vivo, can thus impose a nonimmunogenic phenotype on proliferating human B cells in the absence of any immune pressure </plain></SENT>
