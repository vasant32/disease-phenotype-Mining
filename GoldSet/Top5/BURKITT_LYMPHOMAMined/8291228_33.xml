<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Initiation of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic cycle is dependent on the transcription of the BZLF1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The BZLF1 gene promoter (Zp) was activated by crosslinking of cell surface immunoglobulin (Ig) with anti-Ig antibody in B cells, even in the absence of other <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified several anti-Ig response elements within Zp, which were originally defined as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) response elements (ZI repeats and ZII, an AP-1-like domain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since anti-Ig crosslinking leads to activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and an increase in intracellular calcium level, Zp was tested for the response to these cellular factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 increased Zp activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> was used in conjunction with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, a PKC activator, the Zp induction was synergistically enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1-(5-Isoquinolinyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29825">sulfonyl</z:chebi>)-2-methylpiperazine, an inhibitor of PKC, inhibited the anti-Ig inducibility of Zp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calmodulin <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, compound R24571 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45951">trifluoperazine</z:chebi>, blocked the Zp activation with anti-Ig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that Zp responds directly to changes in the activity of both PKC and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Requirement of tyrosine kinase activation for the anti-Ig-mediated Zp activation was also demonstrated through the use of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> herbimycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These cellular gene regulatory molecules induced with anti-Ig may cooperatively play an important part in achieving efficient EBV activation as seen with anti-Ig treatment in B cells </plain></SENT>
