<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytokine secretion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TNF activity of culture supernatants was measured by L cell cytotoxic assay, and a neutralization test using anti-TNF and/or anti-LT antibodies determined whether the cytotoxic activity was due to TNF or LT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results show that LAK cells secrete both TNF and LT during monoculture and release increased amounts of TNF and LT with non-gliomatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell stimulation, but PBMC secrete only TNF with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>Glioblastoma</z:hpo> or anaplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo> cells, however, did not stimulate cytokine secretion from either LAK cells or PBMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This indicates a discrepancy between the capability of LAK cells to lyse malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cells and cytokine secretion from LAK cells, and suggests that malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cells may produce some factors which inhibit cytokine secretion from LAK cells </plain></SENT>
