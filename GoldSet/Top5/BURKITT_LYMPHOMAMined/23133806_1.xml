<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Evaluation and comparison of 3'-[(18)F]-fluoro-3'-deoxy-L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> (FLT) and 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> (FDG)-PET to monitor early response following both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and temsirolimus treatment in a mouse model of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Daudi xenograft mice were treated with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> or temsirolimus and imaged with FLT-PET and FDG-PET on appropriate days post therapy inititiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical (IHC) studies (H&amp;E, TUNEL, CD20, PCNA and ki-67) and DNA flow cytometry studies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FDG <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> uptake decreased immediately after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> treatment while FLT-PET showed only a late and less pronounced decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A fast induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was observed together with an early accumulation of cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle, suggesting DNA repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Temsirolimus treatment reduced both FDG and FLT <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> uptake immediately after therapy and resulted in a fast induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and G(0)-G(1) phase accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FLT response was less distinct than FDG response and may be controlled by DNA repair early after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, FLT-PET was able to reflect decreased proliferation following temsirolimus </plain></SENT>
