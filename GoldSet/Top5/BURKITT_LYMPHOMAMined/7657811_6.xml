<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we show that physiological concentrations of the endogenous opioid neuropeptide methionine-enkephalin (MET-ENK) and the synthetic enkephalins D-Ala2, Me-Phe4, Gly(ol)5 and D-Ala2, D-Leu5 are stimulants for the in vitro migration of pre-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activation of the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> cell lines NALM 6 and LAZ 221 with MET-ENK resulted in both an increase in their migration and an augmentation in the surface expression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell marker CD9 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> cells were preincubated with an anti-CD9 mAb before challenge with MET-ENK their migration to the enkephalin was markedly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These studies show that endogenous and synthetic opioid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> are stimulants for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> cell migration and suggest that CD9 is important in the regulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell motility </plain></SENT>
