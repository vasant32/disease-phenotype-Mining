<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The samples had been collected for other purposes and were presumably selected without bias toward clinical conditions associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242338" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HTLV infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional differences in antibody positivity were observed, indicating widely distributed loci of occurrence of HTLV on the African continent in people of both black and white ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients with high titers of antibody to HTLV-I had some signs of adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In several groups a high frequency of false positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">serum reactions</z:e> was indicated when specific confirmation steps were included in the assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further characterization of these sera revealed highly <z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>elevated immunoglobulin levels</z:hpo>, possibly due to polyclonal activation of immunoglobulin synthesis in these subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The possibility that related cross-reactive human retroviruses coexist in the same groups was not eliminated </plain></SENT>
