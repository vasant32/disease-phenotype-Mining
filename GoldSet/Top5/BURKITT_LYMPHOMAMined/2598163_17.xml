<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its numerical and structural aberrations have been observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently five protooncogenes have been assigned to the long and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009824'>short arms</z:hpo> of chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequent and nonspecific occurrence of chromosome 1 rearrangements in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> suggests that they play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency, types, and time of the occurrence of chromosome 1 aberrations and their relation to the stage of the disease were studied in 317 patients with various malignant diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In ten patients nonrandom aberrations of chromosome 1 were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, two PRV followed by ANLL, and the remaining six patients suffered from ANLL, ALL, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, MF, SMMoL, and IRSA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In six patients, total or partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of the long arm or of the whole chromosome 1 was present, and in three cases balanced translocations involving chromosome 1 could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the cells of one patient a duplication of the centromeric heterochromatin was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the breakpoints involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, the aberrations of chromosome 1 were almost always be observed at the terminal stage of the diseases </plain></SENT>
