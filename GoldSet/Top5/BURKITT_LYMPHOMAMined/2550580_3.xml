<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell line Daudi is latently infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cells are very sensitive to the growth inhibitory and differentiation-inducing effects of human interferon-alpha (IFN) and we have examined the possibility that these responses are due to induction of EBV replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that only a very small proportion of cells (less than 0.3%) are induced by IFN treatment to express EBV lytic genes at the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> or protein level, whereas cell growth inhibition is complete under the same conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when EBV replication is chemically induced the large increase in lytic gene transcripts, including that of the BZLF1 trans-activator gene, is partially inhibited by concomitant IFN treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA copy number in chemically induced Daudi cells is also partially inhibited by IFN but no effect of IFN on the level of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA is observed in uninduced cells </plain></SENT>
