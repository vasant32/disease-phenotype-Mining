<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We discovered 21 patients with gastric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> through a survey of our NHL registry, and retrospectively analyzed the distinct features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, including the St Jude/Murphy staging, other extranodal involvement, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotype, response to treatment, and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients' median age was 48 years (range, 7-75), and the male-to-female ratio was 2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stage 1 was found in five patients, stage 2 in five patients, and stage 4 in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
