<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although most leukocytes, T lymphocytes in particular, respond to several different chemokines, there is virtually no information on chemokine activities and chemokine receptors in B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A putative chemokine receptor, BLR1, that is expressed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and B lymphocytes was cloned a few years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the gene for BLR1 yielded mice with abnormal primary follicles and germinal centers of the spleen and Peyer's patches, reflecting the inability of B lymphocytes to migrate into B cell areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By screening expressed sequence tag DNA sequences, we have identified a CXC chemokine, termed B cell-attracting chemokine 1 (BCA-1), that is chemotactic for human B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BCA-1 cDNA encodes a protein of 109 amino acids with a leader sequence of 22 residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mature protein shares 23-34% identical amino acids with known CXC chemokines and is constitutively expressed in secondary lymphoid organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BCA-1 was chemically synthesized and tested for activity on murine pre-B cells 300-19 transfected with BLR1 and on human blood B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In transfected cells, BCA-1 induced chemotaxis and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> mobilization demonstrating that it acts via BLR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Under the same conditions, no activity was obtained with 10 CXC and 19 CC chemokines, lymphotactin, neurotactin/fractalkine and several other <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BCA-1 was also a highly effective attractant for human blood B lymphocytes (which express BLR1), but was inactive on freshly isolated or IL-2-stimulated T lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In agreement with the nomenclature rules for chemokine receptors, we propose the term CXCR5 for BLR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Together with the observed disturbance of B cell colonization in BLR1/ CXCR5-deficient mice, the present results indicate that chemotactic recruitment by locally produced BCA-1 is important for the development of B cell areas of secondary lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
