<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD26 is a well-known activation marker on T cells and natural killer (NK) cells [1] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is identical with the ectopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD26 on B cells has been discussed controversially [2,3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have studied the expression of this enzyme on B cells from the peripheral blood of healthy donors and of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVID</z:e> patients, on cells of the Daudi Burkitt line and the EBV-transformed B-cell lines Jojo and Laz509 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DP IV was detected by using anti-CD26 monoclonal antibodies and with help of specific enzyme substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further the influence of specific synthetic DP IV inhibitors on mitogenic activation of purified B cells and DNA synthesis of cell lines was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We could show that in both groups 0-5% of freshly isolated CD20-positive B cells do express the CD26 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After stimulation with pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> or St. aureus protein, the fraction of CD26-positive cells was enhanced up to 51% and 36%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, induction of CD26 expression on B cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVID</z:e> patients occurs in a manner similar to the B cells from healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment of peripheral blood B cells and B-cell lines with highly specific competitive DP IV inhibitors leads to a significant inhibition of DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data show that CD26 can be considered to be an activation marker not only of T- and NK cells but also of a main population of B cells, suggesting an involvement of CD26 in B-cell activation </plain></SENT>
