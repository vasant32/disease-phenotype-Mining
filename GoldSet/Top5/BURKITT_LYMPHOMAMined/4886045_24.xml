<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous reports (1, 2) have established that the expression of certain distinctive membrane antigen(s) on the surface of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (IM) cells is dependent on the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The investigations reported here provide evidence that antibodies directed against EBV antigens, as revealed by the immunofluorescence test on <z:chebi fb="15" ids="15347">acetone</z:chebi>-fixed smears (8), and the membrane reactive antibodies, although often present in the same serum, are nevertheless distinctly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Absorption of Mutua serum, the standard reference serum for demonstrating membrane antigen(s) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and IM cells, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells completely removed anti-membrane activity without significantly affecting the anti-EBV antibody titer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, sera were found which contained one type of antibody but not the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sera with high anti-membrane but low anti-EBV activity were found among relatives of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These sera reacted with the membranes of EBV-carrying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and IM cells in essentially the same way, i.e., against the same spectrum of target cells, as the EBV-positive Mutua serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were unable to block the membrane reactivity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-conjugated Mutua serum, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In some cases they showed weak but incomplete blocking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One such EBV-negative, membrane-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> relative serum (Robert) was conjugated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> and used for direct staining of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and IM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Again, this conjugate reacted against the same target cell spectrum as a Mutua conjugate, but its reactivity was completely blocked by a number of Burkitt patients' sera, although unconjugated Robert serum did not block the Mutua-conjugate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A number of other membrane-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> relative sera also failed to block Mutua, but completely blocked the Robert conjugate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A number of Swedish and African control sera and an isoantiserum gave no blocking against Robert conjugate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It therefore appears that the Mutua conjugate contains at least two antibody specificities against the EBV-determined membrane antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One, but not the other, is shared with the antibody specificity present in Robert's serum and a number of other sera from relatives of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
