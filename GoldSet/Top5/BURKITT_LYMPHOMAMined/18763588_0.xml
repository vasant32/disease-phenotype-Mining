<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: High-dose PCT was given to 6 BL patients aged 41-56 years (median 48.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete clinicohematological remissions were achieved in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two of them the treatment was discontinued after three blocks of PCT because of severe infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to 4-12 month follow-up, remission continues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remission was not achieved in two patients: one patient had primary resistance, the other died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> after the second PCT course before remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time to remission did not correlate with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Duration of myelotoxic <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> varied from 2 to 24 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> did not correlate with age </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Severity of complications caused withdrawal of three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> is biologically heterogenous as it demonstrates different responses to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-M-04 program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Causes of slow regression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass in some patients need further investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In spite of a great number of infectious complications high-dose therapy has no alternative </plain></SENT>
