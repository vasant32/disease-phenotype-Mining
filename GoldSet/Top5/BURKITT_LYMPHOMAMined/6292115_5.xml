<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One cell line (HLB-R1) was established with EBV obtained after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> of Raji cells with HR-1 EBV and the other (HLB-Bl) was established from B95-8 EBV-infected human cord-blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both the HLB-R1 and HLB-B1 lines were susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> with HR-1 EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that EBV DNA was replicated in the superinfected cell lines and that transforming EBV was produced in both the HLB-B1 and HLB-R1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average titer of transforming EBV obtained in the HR-1 EBV superinfected HLB-B1 and HLB-R1 cell lines was 10(4) transforming units (TU)/ml, whereas the average titers of transforming EBV obtained by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> of Raji cells was 10(1) TU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus capable of inducing early antigen (EA) in superinfected Raji cells (lytic virus) was not detected in any transforming virus preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Restriction enzyme digestion patterns of virus DNA isolated from HR-1 and B95-8 cells, as well as from superinfected cells, were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EBV DNA that was replicated in the superinfected HLB-R1 and HLB-B1 cell lines showed a more complex pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that recombination between input HR-1 EBV DNA and latent cell-associated EBV DNA occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Presumably this recombination results in a change in the biological properties of the newly synthesized virus </plain></SENT>
