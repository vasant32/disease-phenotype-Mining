<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized lymphoblastoid cells express high levels of lymphotoxin and use this molecule as an autocrine growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the EBV-derived latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) mediates lymphotoxin production by inducing NF-kappaB binding to the lymphotoxin promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed lymphotoxin production, LMP1 expression, and NF-kappaB activation in Z-43 (EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cells), Daudi (EBV-positive Burkitt's cells), and 3A4 (EBV-negative Burkitt's cells containing a stably transfected <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-inducible LMP1 construct) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Z-43 cells expressed high levels of LMP1 (immunoblot) and lymphotoxin (ELISA); the EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line Daudi expressed neither LMP1 nor lymphotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, induction of LMP1 in the 3A4 cells (exposed to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>) was accompanied by a 13-fold increase in lymphotoxin levels (ELISA) as compared to uninduced (LMP1-negative) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EMSAs demonstrated high levels of NF-kappaB activation in Z-43 and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-induced 3A4 cells, but much lower levels in the uninduced 3A4 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure of these cells to Bay 11-7082 (an inhibitor of IkappaB phosphorylation and, therefore, NF-kappaB activation) abrogated NF-kappaB binding and lymphotoxin production in a dose-dependent manner in both Z-43 and 3A4 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in our model system, autocrine lymphotoxin production is largely driven by NF-kappaB activation, which is in turn mediated by EBV-derived LMP1 signaling </plain></SENT>
