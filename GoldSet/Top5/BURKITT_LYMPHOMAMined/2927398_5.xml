<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the structure and expression of the myc protooncogene in DNA extracted from a primary (uncultured) endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> sample designated eBL3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dot and Northern (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>) blot analyses demonstrated extreme levels of myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in the eBL3 sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nearly complete sequence data of the altered myc locus isolated from eBL3 DNA demonstrated extensive mutations (duplications, insertions, and deletions) in critical myc regulatory regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the data support the idea that myc transcriptional deregulation in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> disease may be a consequence of the position and number of mutations produced within and around the myc locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the myc exon-1-intron-1 hypermutable PvuII site is part of a potential heptamer-nonamer recognition sequence, suggesting a mechanism for mutation in endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
