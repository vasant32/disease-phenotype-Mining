<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High levels of CD23 and CD39 and low levels of CD38 (T10) were characteristic of EBV-B-LCL; the converse was true for Burkitt lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In hybrids the EBV-LCL phenotype was dominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of Burkitt-line cells correlated strongly with that of germinal centre B cells in tonsil sections, but differed markedly from that of marginal zone B cells or follicular mantle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results are discussed in relation to the origin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumours</z:e> of "<z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>" and "endemic" type, in particular to histopathological evidence that Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> develop in germinal centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent studies on the location of the breakpoints of Burkitt chromosomal translocations are also considered to be compatible with this concept, even though different regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus are involved in the two types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
