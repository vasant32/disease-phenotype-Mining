<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using WHO classification, we retrospectively studied the clinicopathological features of PIL cases surgically resected in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 21 cases, 14 males and seven females, with a median age of 66 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common symptom at presentation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (n = 14; 66.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six (28.6%) cases showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and two (9.5%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had multicentric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common location was ileum (n = 11, 52.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty cases (95.2%) were of B-cell lineage, and one (4.8%) was of T-cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These cases were classified as diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLBL) (n = 18; 85.7%), Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 2; 9.5%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002242'>enteropathy</z:hpo>-type T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (EATL) (n = 1; 4.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One case was lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 1- and 2-yr survival rates of the remaining 20 patients were 44.4% and 26.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we describe the clinicopathological findings of a rare case of appendiceal DLBL and another one of ileal EATL, that have never been reported in Taiwan previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found that in Taiwan PIL occurred in the elderly, with a male predominance, showing a relatively aggressive clinical course, and a pattern similar to that seen in western countries, except for the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334638" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple lymphomatous polyposis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
