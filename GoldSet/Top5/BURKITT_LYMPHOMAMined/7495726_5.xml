<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It appears that the switch recombination machinery of a B lymphocyte targets preferentially unrearranged heavy chain genes that have been rendered transcriptionally active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional activation of the 'germline' human C alpha 1 and C alpha 2 genes is triggered by TGF-beta 1 and is controlled by proximal positive and distal negative regulatory elements residing upstream of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 switch regions respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we characterize the positive proximal regulatory elements and analyse their interaction with DNA binding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that a 100 bp fragment that contains a cAMP responsive element (CRE)/activating transcription factor (ATF) motif, a putative Ets binding site and an element that is created by two previously described neighbouring direct repeats (DRE), can increase the basal level of transcription and confer TGF-beta 1 inducibility to a heterologous promoter in an orientation- and position-independent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitously expressed DNA binding proteins interact specifically with the CRE/ATF, the Ets site and the DRE element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, nuclear proteins interact with sequences which are located downstream of this enhancer are not essential for transcription in the transient expression assays utilized; however, they contain motifs that have been previously implicated in regulating DNA recombination events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These motifs include a Chi motif and a Chi-like element previously found in the recombination hotspot region of the Bcl-2 proto-oncogene and close to chromosomal breakpoints in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings raise the possibility that the intervening region associated regulatory elements in addition to regulating the transcriptional activation of the Ig heavy chain genes could also facilitate the physical interaction of transcription and recombination controlling molecular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
