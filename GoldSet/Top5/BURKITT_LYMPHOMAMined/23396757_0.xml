<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These two genetic processes endow Abs with protective functions against a multitude of antigens (pathogens) during humoral immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In B cells, AID expression is regulated at the level of either transcriptional activation on AID gene loci or post-transcriptional suppression of AID <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, AID stabilization and targeting are determined by post-translational modifications and interactions with other cellular/nuclear factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, aberrant expression of AID causes B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> caused by c-myc/IgH translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AID is also ectopically expressed in T cells and non-immune cells, and triggers point mutations in relevant DNA loci, resulting in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, I review the recent literatures on the function of AID, regulation of AID expression, stability and targeting in B cells, and AID-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
