<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD74 mostly is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological tumors</z:e>, but is expressed also in solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> of the humanized anti-CD74 antibody, milatuzumab, were examined for the therapy CD74-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Milatuzumab-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, and two milatuzumab-SN-38 conjugates with cleavable linkers, differing in their stability in serum and how they release SN-38 in the lysosome, were prepared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD74 expression was determined by flow cytometry and immunohistology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo therapeutic studies were performed in the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines A-375 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>), HuH-7 and Hep-G2 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e>), Capan-1 (pancreatic), NCI-N87 (gastric), and Raji Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The milatuzumab-SN-38 ADC was compared to SN-38 ADCs prepared with anti-Trop-2 and anti-CEACAM6 antibodies in xenografts expressing their target antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Milatuzumab-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> was most effective in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> model, while in A-375 and Capan-1 solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, only milatuzumab-SN-38 showed a therapeutic benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite much lower surface expression of CD74 than Trop-2 or CEACAM6, milatuzumab-SN-38 had similar efficacy in Capan-1 as anti-Trop-2-SN-38, but in NCI-N87, anti-CEACAM6 and anti-Trop-2 conjugates were superior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies in 2 hepatoma lines at a single dose level showed significant benefit over saline controls, but not against an irrelevant IgG conjugate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD74 is a suitable target for <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> xenografts, with efficacy largely influenced by uniformity of CD74 expression, and with SN-38 conjugates providing the best therapeutic responses; SN-38 conjugates were preferable in solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was better in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tested </plain></SENT>
