<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the role of SCF and its receptor, c-kit, in the pathogenesis of pediatric Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), we investigated the expression of SCF and c-kit in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells and the mitogenic activity of SCF on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A panel of 13 BL cell lines and 7 fresh biopsy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells were stimulated either by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or by different reagents and cytokines, and expression of SCF and c-kit was studied on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level by Northern blot analysis and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), followed by Southern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>c-kit expression was also studied by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and by crosslinking of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi>-labeled recombinant human SCF to the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines was measured by 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low-level expression of c-kit <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected in 2 of 13 unstimulated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines and in 1 fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One cell line showed upregulation of c-kit <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> with A23187 and downregulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither c-kit nor SCF could be detected in any other cell line under any condition of stimulation as analyzed by Northern blot analysis, RT-PCR followed by Southern blot analysis, crosslinking, and immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No response to SCF was seen in 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells express neither SCF nor c-kit and that the low-level expression of c-kit in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells most likely has no biologic significance </plain></SENT>
