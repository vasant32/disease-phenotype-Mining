<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxic activation of iC3b receptor function requires ligation of both a CD11b I-domain site for iC3b and a lectin site located in the C-terminus of CD11b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> lack the CR3-binding <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharides</z:chebi> of bacteria and fungi, iC3b-opsonized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> do not stimulate CR3-dependent cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous studies showed that NK cells could be induced to kill iC3b-opsonized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> with small soluble beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37163">glucans</z:chebi> that bound with high affinity to CR3, bypassing the absence of similar <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharides</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because CR3 signalling requires several tyrosine phosphorylation events, it appeared possible that CR3-dependent killing of autologous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells might be suppressed by NK cell inhibitory receptors for MHC class I (KIR and CD94/NKG2) whose action involves recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the current study, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cells were used as targets following opsonization with iC3b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Soluble beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37163">glucan</z:chebi> primed CR3 for killing of iC3b-coated B cells, but autologous class I-bearing targets were 84% more resistant than class I-deficient Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blockade of target cell class I with a MoAb specific for a domain recognized by both KIR and CD94/NKG2 resulted in comparable killing of class I+ B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, another MoAb to class II had no effect on cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that NK cell recognition of class I suppresses CR3/tyrosine kinase-dependent cytotoxicity in the same way as it suppresses cytotoxicity mediated by other tyrosine kinase-linked receptors such as FcgammaRIIIA (CD16) </plain></SENT>
