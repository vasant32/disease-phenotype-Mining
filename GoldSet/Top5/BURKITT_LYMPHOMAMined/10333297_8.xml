<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase B transcription factor 3 (BTF3), which is associated with anti-IgM antibody-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, using a subclone of the human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BL60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify the transcription factor BTF3, which is expressed only in minor amounts, we used preparative high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) employing carrier ampholytes for isoelectric focusing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the 2DE protein patterns from apoptotic and nonapoptotic cells showed BTF3 as a predominantly altered protein spot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The characterization of the differentially expressed transcription factor and 13 marker proteins described in this study were performed by internal Edman microsequencing and/or by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proteome analysis was significantly improved by performing the newly developed preparative high-resolution two-dimensional gels employing high protein concentrations </plain></SENT>
