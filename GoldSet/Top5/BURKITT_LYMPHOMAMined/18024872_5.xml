<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 68 children affected by de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> enrolled onto the Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster-based Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> LNH-97 clinical protocol were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow aspirate from each patient was analyzed for the presence of t(8;14)(q24;q32) by long-distance polymerase chain reaction at diagnosis, after the first chemotherapy cycle, and after subsequent cycles until negative for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphologic and immunophenotypic analyses were reviewed centrally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 47 patients (69%) were positive for t(8;14)(q24;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> response kinetics was determined in 39 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them reached clinical complete remission and most (31 of 39) became <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> negative after the first chemotherapy cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3-year relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) was 38% (SE = 17%) in patients <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> positive after the first chemotherapy cycle compared with 84% (SE = 7%) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>-negative patients (P = .0005), whereas there was no difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> for children who reached a clinical complete remission after the first chemotherapy cycle versus those who did not (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> = 72% and SE = 9%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> = 79% and SE = 11%, respectively; P = .8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> was shown to be predictive of higher risk of failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> carries a negative prognostic impact in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> patients and suggests that a better risk-adapted therapy, possibly including the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, should be considered in selected patients </plain></SENT>
