<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cellular subclone of the P3J-HR-1 line designated GG68-13 made these studies possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Less than 1% of GG68-13 cells spontaneously synthesize <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigens, whereas more than 80% of the cells enter the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replicative cycle after exposure to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the absence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> six clearly resolved <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>'s, derived from scattered regions of the genome, are seen and at least four poorly resolved <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>'s map to BamHI fragment W, the internal repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following treatment with the drug, 54 mRNA's have been identified, 28 of which are prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>'s identified during latency are also synthesized, but in greater amounts, during <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, EBV-encoded small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>'s seem to be more abundant during latency than during <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> synthesis </plain></SENT>
