<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most prominent of these has an estimated mass of approximately 76 kDa (Middle-Fragment of Apoptotic cleavage of eIF4G; M-FAG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subcellular fractionation of the BJAB <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line after induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> indicates that M-FAG occurs in both ribosome-bound and soluble forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Affinity chromatography on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50210">m7GTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> shows that M-FAG retains the ability of eIF4GI to associate with both the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> cap-binding protein eIF4E and initiation factor eIF4A and that the ribosome-bound form of M-FAG is also present as a complex with eIF4E and eIF4A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the binding sites for eIF4E, eIF4A and eIF3 on eIF4GI are retained in the caspase-generated fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>M-FAG is also a substrate for cleavage by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Foot-and-Mouth-Disease</z:e> Virus-encoded L protease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These properties, together with the pattern of recognition by a panel of antibodies, define the origin of the apoptotic cleavage fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>N-terminal sequencing of the products of caspase-3-mediated eIF4GI cleavage has identified the major cleavage sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of eIF4GI degradation and the possible roles of the individual cleavage products in cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> are discussed </plain></SENT>
