<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the effects of novel benzoxazol-2-yl and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36622">benzimidazol</z:chebi>-2-yl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38532">hydrazones</z:chebi> derived from 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38187">pyridinecarbaldehyde</z:chebi> and 2-acetylpyridine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IC(50) values for inhibition of cell proliferation in KB-3-1, CCRF-CEM, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, HT-29, HeLa, ZR-75 and MEXF276L by most of the novel compounds are in the nanomolar range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In colony-forming assays with human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenografts the compounds 2-actylpyridine benzoxazol-2-ylhydrazone (EPH52), 2-acetylpyridine benzoimidazol-2-ylhydrazone (EPH61) and 2-acetylpyridine 1-methylbenzoimidazol-2-ylhydrazone (EPH116) exhibited above-average inhibition of colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (IC(50) = 1.3-4.56 nM); EPH52 and EPH116 also exhibited above-average inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As shown with human liver microsomes, EPH116 is only moderately metabolized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The compound inhibited the growth of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> xenografts in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thiosemicarbazones derived from 2-formylpyridines have been shown to be inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26561">ribonucleotide</z:chebi> reductase (RR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The following results show that RR is not the target of the novel compounds: cells overexpressing the M2 subunit of RR and resistant to the RR inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> are not cross-resistant to the novel compounds; inhibition of RR occurs at 6- to 73-fold higher drug concentrations than that of inhibition of cell proliferation; the pattern of cell cycle arrest in S phase induced by the RR inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> is not observed after treatment with the novel compounds; and a COMPARE analysis with the related compounds 2-acetylpyrazine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45993">benzothiazol</z:chebi>-2-ylhydrazone (EPH95) and 3-acetylisoquinoline benzoxazol-2-ylhydrazone (EPH136) showed that the pattern of these compounds is not related to any of the standard antitumor drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these novel compounds show inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> and exhibit a novel mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
