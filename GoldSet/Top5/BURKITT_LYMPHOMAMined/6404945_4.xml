<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 31 cases of Middle Eastern gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (from Mosul, Iraq) has been analysed by conventional histology, and also by immunoperoxidase staining of trypsinised paraffin sections with anti-Ig and anti-J chain antisera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologically these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> fell into three categories: undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of Burkitt type (8 cases); follicle centre cell (FCC) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, resembling European <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of FCC origin (15 cases); and Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (MTL) (3 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistological staining of the FCC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> showed that these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> resembled their European counterpart in that cytoplasmic Ig and J chain could be demonstrated in a proportion of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However there was a striking difference in that alpha chain alone, light chain alone, or J chain alone were detected in several cases (in contrast to the predominance of mu plus kappa or lambda light chains found in European cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, prominent intracellular inclusions of alpha chains were found in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Staining of the MTL cases revealed that the characteristic mucosal plasma cell infiltrate was positive for alpha chain (weakly) and J chain (strongly) but that the invasive cells which morphologically resembled FCCs were negative for both constituents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is argued that these three histological categories constitute the major types of gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the Middle East; and that in MTL the invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is of FCC type </plain></SENT>
