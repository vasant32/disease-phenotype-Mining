<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A central pathology review system with an immunophenotyping laboratory was established in Japan to support the clinical trial, the Japan Association of Childhood <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>Leukaemia</z:mpath> Study (JACLS) NHL-98, for patients with paediatric non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathology samples from 155 clinically-suspected NHL cases were evaluated centrally initially using the Revised European-American <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (REAL) classification in a rapid review (within 2 weeks after surgery/biopsy) and then later at the consensus review (once a year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The samples were subsequently re-classified according to the new World Health Organisation (WHO) classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the pathology review, 96 (62%) patients were eligible for the study, and 58 of them (60%) had extra-nodal primaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These NHL cases included B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (precursor B-cell, 11; Burkitt, 18; diffuse large B-cell, 18; not otherwise specified, 3) and T/Natural Killer (NK)-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (precursor T-cell, 23; anaplastic large cell, 20; others, 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was excellent concordance in making the diagnoses (95/96, 99%) and typing (93/96, 97%) of NHL between the rapid and consensus reviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five cases, initially diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by the review, were re-classified as Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> according to the immunocytochemical criteria by the WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 59 (38%) cases were excluded from the study: they were Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (7), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> (11), reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (20), necrotizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo> (7), no consensus diagnosis (1), insufficient materials (2), and others (11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of the central pathology review from the paediatric NHL group study in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because various diseases, either neoplastic or reactive, mimicked NHL, clinically and histopathologically, the central pathology review system was critical and essential for patient enrollment and protocol assignment in our clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Through the two-step review system, highly reliable data were generated to support this study </plain></SENT>
