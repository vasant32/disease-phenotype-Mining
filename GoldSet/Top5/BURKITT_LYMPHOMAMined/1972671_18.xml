<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a study of Gambian children which endeavours to explain these findings we showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> P. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024535" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">falciparum malaria</z:e> caused spontaneous activation and growth of their B lymphocytes in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of these cells contained Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In ancillary experiments aimed at explaining these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD4 helper cells from adult donors were destroyed with monoclonal antibody and complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This manoeuvre resulted in loss of cytotoxic T cell control of their B lymphocytes when infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e>, both spontaneous immunoglobulin and antibody production by B cells was increased yet CD4 helper cell control over these cells, as measured by responses to pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>, was found to be intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous and concanavalin A-driven lymphocyte proliferation was depressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We infer from these findings that in patients with P. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024535" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">falciparum malaria</z:e> loss of cytotoxic T cell control of the EBV in B cells, possibly due to destruction or dysfunction of a subset of CD4 cells responsible for induction of suppressor/cytotoxic CD8 cells, leads to activation and proliferation of foci of B cells containing EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expanded pool and rapid turnover of these cells may increase chances of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> leading to the genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Partial loss of suppressor mechanisms coupled with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD4 helper/inducer activity may result in high serum levels of immunoglobulin which are characteristic of persons living in malarious regions </plain></SENT>
