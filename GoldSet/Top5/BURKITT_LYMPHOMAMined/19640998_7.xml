<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EBERs have been shown to impart significant tumorigenic potential upon EBV-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells and to contribute to the growth potential of other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-, gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>-, and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>-derived cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms underlying this EBER-dependent enhancement of cell growth potential remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we focused on the known interaction between EBER-1 and the cellular ribosomal protein L22 and the consequences of this interaction with respect to the growth-promoting properties of the EBERs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>L22, a component of 60S ribosomal subunits, binds three sites on EBER-1, and a substantial fraction of available L22 is relocalized from nucleoli to the nucleoplasm in EBV-infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate the hypothesis that EBER-1-mediated relocalization of L22 in EBV-infected cells is critical for EBER-dependent functions, we investigated whether EBER-1 expression is necessary and sufficient for nucleoplasmic retention of L22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following demonstration of this, we utilized <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-protein binding assays and fluorescence localization studies to demonstrate that mutation of the L22 binding sites on EBER-1 prevents L22 binding and inhibits EBER-1-dependent L22 relocalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the in vivo consequence of preventing L22 relocalization in EBER-expressing cells was examined in soft agar colony formation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells expressing mutated EBER-1 RNAs rendered incapable of binding L22 have significantly reduced capacity to enhance cell growth potential relative to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells expressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> EBERs </plain></SENT>
