<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Partial denaturation mapping revealed that the EBV DNA population of Raji cells is homogeneous and that two deletions are observed in distant parts of the genome compared to linear DNA isolated from virus particles of different strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These deletions were characterized by blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One deletion of 3.15 kb lies within HindIII-E; the second is 2.4 kb and is located close to the right terminus of linear <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two deletions were observed in several cell lines derived from the Raji line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These deletions might contribute to the inability of Raji cells to produce EBV either spontaneously or upon induction </plain></SENT>
