<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, this B-cell surface antigen has been shown recently to be an effective target for immunotherapy of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> using chimeric (mouse/human) or radiolabeled murine monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we show that extensive crosslinking of CD20 with murine anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) in the presence of either goat anti-mouse IgG or Fc receptor (FcR)-expressing cells directly inhibits B-cell proliferation, induces nuclear DNA fragmentation, and leads to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic effects of these MoAbs can be inhibited by chelation of extracellular or intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30740">EGTA</z:chebi> or Bapta AM, indicating that anti-CD20-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may be related to changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that ligation of CD20 in vivo by anti-CD20 antibodies in the presence of FcR-expressing cells may initiate signal transduction events that induce elevation of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i and lead to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of malignant B cells, thereby contributing to the impressive <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regressions</z:mp> observed in mouse models and clinical trials using anti-CD20 MoAbs </plain></SENT>
