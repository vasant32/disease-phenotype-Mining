<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report five cases of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> arising in organ transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were four men and one woman with a mean age of 35 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were solid organ recipients with three renal, one liver, and one double lung transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time interval between organ transplantation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> averaged 4.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients typically presented with high-stage disease with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008940'>generalized lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> and bone marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histology showed classic Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or atypical variant/Burkitt-like <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>C-MYC rearrangement, including three cases with immunoglobulin heavy chain and two cases with lambda light chain, and Epstein-Barr virus were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional chromosomal abnormalities were present in two of three cases and p53 mutation was found in one of three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aberrant genotype and phenotype were frequently encountered, including minor monoclonal or oligoclonal T-cell populations and undetectable surface immunoglobulin light chain expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients received antilymphoma regimens, with combination chemotherapy (three patients) and/or Rituximab (three patients), in addition to reduction of immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients achieved complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that posttransplant Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> represents a characteristic clinicopathologic entity and occurs later after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Genotypic and phenotypic aberrations are often present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Rituximab may be an effective alternative to conventional combination chemotherapy in the treatment of a posttransplant Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
