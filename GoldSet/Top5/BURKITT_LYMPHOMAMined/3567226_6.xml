<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the ability of these cells to synthesize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26440">pyrimidine nucleosides</z:chebi> by ribo- and deoxyribosyl transfer between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26432">pyrimidine bases</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleosides</z:chebi> and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26394">purine nucleosides</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">inosine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28997">deoxyinosine</z:chebi> as donors of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi> 1-phosphate and deoxyribose 1-phosphate, respectively: these reactions involve the activities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26394">purine-nucleoside</z:chebi> phosphorylase, and of the two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26440">pyrimidine-nucleoside</z:chebi> phosphorylases (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> phosphorylase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> phosphorylase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ability of the cells to synthesize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> was estimated from their ability to grow on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> precursors in the presence of an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> de novo synthesis (pyrazofurin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their ability to synthesize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> and deoxyuridine was estimated from the inhibition of the incorporation of radiolabelled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> in cells cultured in the presence of unlabelled precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to these studies on intact cells, we determined the activities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26440">pyrimidine-nucleoside</z:chebi> phosphorylases in cell extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results show that Raji cells efficiently metabolize preformed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi>, deoxyuridine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi>, are unable to salvage <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26432">pyrimidine bases</z:chebi>, and possess a low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> phosphorylase activity and markedly decreased (about 1% of peripheral blood lymphocytes) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> phosphorylase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes have higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26440">pyrimidine-nucleoside</z:chebi> phosphorylases activities, they can synthesize deoxyuridine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> from bases, but at high an non-physiological concentrations of precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither type of cell is able to salvage <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26440">pyrimidine-nucleoside</z:chebi> phosphorylases have a catabolic, rather than an anabolic, role in human lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The facts that, compared to peripheral blood lymphocytes, lymphoblasts possess decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26440">pyrimidine-nucleoside</z:chebi> phosphorylases activities, and, on the other hand, more efficiently salvage <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26440">pyrimidine nucleosides</z:chebi>, are consistent with a greater need of these rapidly proliferating cells for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26441">pyrimidine nucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
