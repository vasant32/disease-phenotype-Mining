<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> of IgM kappa phenotype and a stable clinical course, in which repeated chromosome analyses of blood lymphocytes revealed the coexistence of t(14;18), a marker often associated with follicular low grade lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and t(2;8), a variant of the t(8;14) typically seen in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both these translocations involve immunoglobulin gene regions, the t(2;8) being almost always found in patients with kappa light chain restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in an EBV-immortalized cell line of this patient, most karyotypes contained t(14;18) alone, without the t(2;8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that t(14;18) was the primary cytogenetic event, and that t(2;8) evolved subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a secondary cytogenetic event, the t(2;8) may not share the grave clinical consequences of a primary t(2;8) as seen in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and related disorders </plain></SENT>
