<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TCR-delta rearrangements or deletions were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> T (33 cases) and B lineage (28 cases) ALL but not in any case of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> proliferations (13 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The restriction patterns of rearrangement were clearly distinct between T and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B ALL</z:e> and use of one V delta probe showed that rearrangement of the V delta IDP2 gene segment which is also productively rearranged in the Peer cell line, occurred frequently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> but never in B lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies of WT31 and delta TCS1 antibody reactivity showed that at least 4 of 13 CD3+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> cases expressed the delta protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD4 and/or CD8 Ag expression were observed in some of the gamma delta expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data show that particular TCR-delta gene rearrangements occur in neoplastic early B cells and that the combinatorial diversity of TCR-delta rearrangements in T cells is higher than initially expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition this study shows that an important proportion of CD3 positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> cases express the gamma delta heterodimer </plain></SENT>
