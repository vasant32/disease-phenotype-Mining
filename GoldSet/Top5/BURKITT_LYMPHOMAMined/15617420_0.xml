<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To document the various radiological manifestations of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as seen in patients at the Kenyatta National Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective study of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cases admitted to the paediatric and Ear, Nose and Throat Wards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Kenyatta National Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> histological proven cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> had the following documented; Age sex, tribe, geographical (province) of origin, full medical evaluation results, presenting site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, radiological findings and results of chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound occipital frontal view of the skull X-ray. computerised tomography, myelography and orthopantomograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the period between April 1991 and March 1992 this study registered 49 patients age range 2 to 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These were males 34 (69%) and females 15 (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The commonest radiological findings was associate with intra abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> seen in 65.2% of the cases, the least findings associated with cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> each 3.3% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty (41%) of the disease was clinically confined to the facial area while radiologically 25% of these were demonstrated to extend to the abdomen as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Disease extent on radiological examination was found to be more extensive compared to clinical evaluation alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The observation emphasised the role of radiological investigation in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in this setting </plain></SENT>
