<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IFN-tau, originally identified as a pregnancy recognition hormone, is a type I IFN that is related to IFN-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examine here the mechanism of the antiproliferative effects of IFN-alpha and IFN-tau in terms of their effects on intracellular events that regulate the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both IFN inhibited proliferation of the human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Daudi, causing accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IFN-alpha was more effective than IFN-tau in this regard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both IFN were found to inhibit the kinase activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase cdk2 in a manner that correlated with their relative abilities to cause cells to accumulate in the G1 phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, IFN treatment did not affect the expression of cdk2 protein, suggesting that the IFN modulated cdk2 activity through a cdk inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this conclusion, both IFN induced the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein p21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels of p21 induced also correlated with the relative abilities of the IFN to inhibit cdk2 activity and to arrest cell growth in the G1 phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, following IFN treatment, increased levels of p21 were found complexed with cdk2, consistent with its role in the inhibition of cdk2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that p21-mediated inhibition of cdk2 activity plays an important role in the antiproliferative activity of type I IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings highlight interesting similarities between these cytokines and the products of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes, such as p53, and may indicate a mechanism for the antitumor effects of the type I IFN </plain></SENT>
