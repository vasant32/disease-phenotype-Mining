<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(2) PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight eligible patients with previously untreated disseminated non-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were enrolled on a Childrens <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Group study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therapy included cycles of chemotherapy, systemic and intrathecal (IT), ever 3 weeks for a total maximal duration of 57 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five patients had small non-cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (SNCCL) and 13 had diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven were stage III, six were stage IV, and 15 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>; 13 had central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) RESULTS: Four year event-free survival (EFS) was 53% (SE +/- 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stage III SNCCL patients with LDH &lt; 500 IU/L achieved an improved EFS compared to other SNCCL patients (86% vs. 42% 4 year EFS, P = .072) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary site of failure for advanced stage SNCCL patients was the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Ki-1-positive DLCL patients relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patterns of failure, time to relapse, and outcome following relapse differed between SNCCL and DLCL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(4) CONCLUSIONS: Advanced stage SNCCL requires better <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-directed chemotherapy to reduce the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> failure rate; however, the achievement of durable disease-free survival in four of 11 patients with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease without use of cranial irradiation suggests merit for further evaluation of chemotherapy-only strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DLCL patients do not need intensive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-directed chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
