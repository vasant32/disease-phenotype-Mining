<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Absence of a reliable method for determining the level of c-myc expression has impeded the analysis of its biological and clinical relevance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have standardized the conditions for a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis for c-myc expression, including the selection of an endogenous reference (18S rRNA), the adequate number of measurements for each sample (2 cDNA in triplicate), and suitable controls for determining inter- and intrarun variability (standard curve and calibrator) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, in a series of 56 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, we analyzed the expression of c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and of other functionally related proteins (bcl-6, p27, cyclin D3, and p53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As expected, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases analyzed had high levels of c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression compared with that observed in reactive lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a wider range of expression in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, with 30% (15 of 48) of cases overexpressing c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This overexpression was largely independent of c-myc translocations (4 of 5), as demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> series, a high level of c-myc expression predicted lower survival probability, irrespectively of the International Prognostic Index risk group classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A slightly increased frequency of p53 inactivation was observed in the cases with c-myc overexpression, which suggests a growth advantage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with concurrent deregulation of c-myc and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, a moderate increase in bcl-6 protein expression was observed in the c-myc-positive cases, suggesting the existence of a complex interrelationship between these two genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that c-myc may play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of a subset of large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and suggest the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms of c-myc expression to c-myc rearrangements </plain></SENT>
