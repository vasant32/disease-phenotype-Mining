<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A fraction of isolated Raji cell membranes solubilized with 2m <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32030">KBr</z:chebi> which was capable of inhibiting C3-dependent rosettes was examined for its ability to inhibit the alternative pathway of complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was shown to decrease alternative pathway-dependent haemolysis of sheep erythrocytes and to accelerate decay of factor B from these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It had no effect on C2 decay, the classical pathway analog of factor B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inhibitory activity solubilized from Raji cells was not removed by immunoadsorption with anti-factor H or anti-factor I, two well-characterized serum C3b-control proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It also differed in two functional respects from these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Firstly, it failed to result in cleavage of a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> bone in C3 which is characteristic of factor I; secondly, its inhibitory activity did not synergize with factor I in inhibiting the alternative pathway, unlike factor H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Raji cells contain a regulatory factor in their membranes for the alternative pathway of complement which is distinct from factors H and I </plain></SENT>
