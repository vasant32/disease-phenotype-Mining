<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MDR15 and BLR1 cDNAs differ in the 5' region, where the open reading frame of MDR15 is shorter by 45 codons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Southern-blot analysis indicates that the two transcripts for MDR15 and BLR1 are encoded by the same gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Northern-blot analysis using a probe that hybridizes with both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> demonstrated high-level expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> B-lymphoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and, to a lesser extent, peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription-PCR studies with MDR15- and BLR1-specific primers showed similar levels of transcripts for both receptors in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> that was positive in Northern-blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MDR15 and BLR1 have high structural similarity to receptors for human IL-8 (about 40% amino acid identity) and other chemokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, none of a series of radiolabelled chemokines (IL-8, NAP-2, GRO alpha, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>, IP10, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-2, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-3, I-309, RANTES and MIP-1 alpha) and other ligands (C3a and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi>) bound to Jurkat transfectants that stably expressed either MDR15 or BLR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The fact that MDR15 and BLR1 are expressed on leucocytes and show marked sequence similarity to chemokine receptors suggests the existence of as yet unidentified chemokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Alternative transcript formation affecting the 5'-terminal part of the coding region may be a way to modify ligand-binding selectivity </plain></SENT>
