<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa contains several carbohydrate-binding proteins, among which is the P. aeruginosa lectin I (PA-IL), which displays affinity for alpha-galactosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Glycan arrays were screened and demonstrated stronger binding of PA-IL toward alphaGal1-4betaGal-terminating structures and weaker binding to alphaGal1-3betaGal ones in order to determine which human glycoconjugates could play a role in the carbohydrate-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of the bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed in vivo by testing the binding of the lectin to Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells that present large amounts of globotriaosylceramide antigen Gb3/CD77/P(k) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27150">Trisaccharide</z:chebi> moieties of Gb3 (alphaGal1-4betaGal1-4Glc) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52570">isoglobotriaosylceramide</z:chebi> (alphaGal1-3betaGal1-4Glc) were tested by titration microcalorimetry, and both displayed similar affinity to PA-IL in solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure of PA-IL complexed to alphaGal1-3betaGal1-4Glc <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27150">trisaccharide</z:chebi> has been solved at 1.9-A resolution and revealed how the second <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> residue makes specific contacts with the protein surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular modeling studies were performed in order to compare the binding mode of PA-IL toward alphaGal1-3Gal with that toward alphaGal1-4Gal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Docking studies demonstrated that alphaGal1-4Gal creates another network of contacts for achieving a very similar affinity, and 10-ns molecular dynamics in explicit water allowed for analyzing the flexibility of each <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36233">disaccharide</z:chebi> ligand in the protein binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The higher affinity observed for binding to Gb3 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>, both in vivo and on glycan array, is likely related to the presentation effect of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> on a surface, since only the Gb3 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi> geometry is fully compatible with parallel insertion of neighboring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27150">trisaccharide</z:chebi> heads in two binding sites of the same tetramer of PA-IL </plain></SENT>
