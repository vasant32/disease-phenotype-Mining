<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Calpains are cysteine proteases that have been implicated as both effectors and suppressors of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we showed that c-myc transformation regulated calpain activity and sensitized cells to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by calpain inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the role of calpain in the Eμ-myc <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519606" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">transgenic model</z:e> of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Calpain activity assays, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, cell cycle assays, and expression measurements were used to determine the activity and role of calpain in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that Eμ-myc transgenic cells have highly elevated calpain activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Calpastatin, the negative calpain regulator, was expressed at much lower levels in Eμ-myc <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> splenic B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary isoform in Eμ-myc <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is calpain 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of Eμ-myc <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with the calpain inhibitors PD150606 or calpain inhibitor III induced caspase-3-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>General caspase inhibitors or caspase-3/7 inhibitor protected cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by calpain inhibitor, whereas caspase-9 inhibitors failed to rescue cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (BL2) cells display a pattern of sensitivity and caspase-3 dependence similar to calpain inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment of Eμ-myc <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-bearing mice with PD150606 inhibited calpain activity in vivo and induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in these cells as determined by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiple daily treatments resulted in reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> load, particularly in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, calpain is highly elevated in the Eμ-myc <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and calpain inhibition has therapeutic potential </plain></SENT>
