<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human lymphoid cell lines contain a DNA repair enzyme which removes the mutagenic alkylation lesion O6-methylguanine from DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The enzyme transfers the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32875">methyl group</z:chebi> to a protein <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residue</z:chebi>, generating S-methylcysteine, and is inactivated as a consequence of the reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apparently the methylated enzyme represents a dead-end complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transfer reaction is very rapid and is completed in less than 1 min at 37 degrees, but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32875">methyl group</z:chebi> transfer from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi> or heavily damaged DNA is less efficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The active methyltransferase and the methylated protein both have molecular weights of 21,000 to 22,000, as determined by gel filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lymphoid cell lines proficient in repair of O6-methylguanine in vivo, Mex+, contain 10,000 to 25,000 molecules of the methyltransferase per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, repair-deficient cell lines, Mex-, do not contain detectable amounts of the enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter point was verified by applying a partial purification procedure for the enzyme to cell-free extracts from two Mex- cell lines </plain></SENT>
