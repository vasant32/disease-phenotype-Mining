<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cells are equally susceptible to P3HR-1 EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> as determined by EBV early antigen (EA) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cell lines were pretreated with human recombinant interferons alpha 2, beta, or gamma and subsequently superinfected with P3HR-1 EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their expression of two distinct EBV early gene products was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies to the diffuse (EA-D) and restricted (EA-R) components of the EA complex were used to determine the number of cells expressing each of these antigens in the treated cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As previously described with human leukocyte interferon, EA-D expression in Raji cells was relatively resistant to interferon-alpha 2 pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, EA-D expression in Daudi cells was relatively sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, interferon alpha 2 pretreatment produced an opposite pattern with respect to the expression of EA-R in these two cell lines; Raji cells were sensitive and Daudi cells relatively resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interferon beta had the most uniformly effective anti-EBV activity on both cell lines; less than 15 U/ml produced 50% inhibition of both antigens in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EA-D expression in both cell lines was sensitive to interferon-gamma pretreatment and EA-R was resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that different gene products of EBV are independently regulated by interferons based on at least three factors: (1) the host cell, (2) the type of interferon and (3) the affected gene product </plain></SENT>
