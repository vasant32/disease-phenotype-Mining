<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the induction of cellular gene expression by the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, LMP1 was shown to induce the expression of ICAM-1, LFA-3, CD40, and EBI3 in EBV-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells and of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) in epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now show that LMP1 expression also increased Fas and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LMP1 mediates NF-kappaB activation via two independent domains located in its C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a TRAF-interacting site that associates with TRAF1, -2, -3, and -5 through a PXQXT/S core motif and a TRADD-interacting site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In EBV-transformed B cells or transiently transfected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, significant amounts of TRAF1, -2, -3, and -5 are associated with LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In epithelial cells, very little TRAF1 is expressed, and only TRAF2, -3, and -5, are significantly complexed with LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The importance of TRAF binding to the PXQXT/S motif in LMP1-mediated gene induction was studied by using an LMP1 mutant that contains alanine point mutations in this motif and fails to associate with TRAFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This mutant, LMP1(P204A/Q206A), induced 60% of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> LMP1 NF-kappaB activation and had approximately 60% of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> LMP1 effect on Fas, ICAM-1, CD40, and LFA-3 induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, LMP1(P204A/Q206A) was substantially more impaired in TRAF1, EBI3, and EGF-R induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, TRAF binding to the PXQXT/S motif has a nonessential role in up-regulating Fas, ICAM-1, CD40, and LFA-3 expression and a critical role in up-regulating TRAF1, EBI3, and EGF-R expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, D1 LMP1, an LMP1 mutant that does not aggregate failed to induce TRAF1, EBI3, Fas, ICAM-1, CD40, and LFA-3 expression confirming the essential role for aggregation in LMP1 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of a dominant form of IkappaBalpha blocked LMP1-mediated TRAF1, EBI3, Fas, ICAM-1, CD40, and LFA-3 up-regulation, indicating that NF-kappaB is an important component of LMP1-mediated gene induction from both the TRAF- and TRADD-interacting sites </plain></SENT>
