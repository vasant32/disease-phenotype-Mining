<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the authors evaluated EBV-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (EBER) expression by in situ hybridization in 300 cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> diagnosed by lymph node biopsy, with 100 cases of reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> in lymph nodes as controls, for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 100 consecutive cases of classical Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (cHL), 100 consecutive cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, B cell (NHL-B), and 100 consecutive cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, T cell (NHL-T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBER expression was detected in 46% of reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> cases, but the positively stained cells in those cases constituted less than 5 percent of the total cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When using the presence of EBER in 5 percent or more of the cell population and/or the presence of EBER in the Hodgkin's Reed-Sternberg's cells as indicators of positivity, 64% of cHL, 13% of NHL-B, and 51% of NHL-T were found to be positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study indicates a strong association of cHL and NHL-T with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, the link apparently being weaker for NHL-B except for the subtypes of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
