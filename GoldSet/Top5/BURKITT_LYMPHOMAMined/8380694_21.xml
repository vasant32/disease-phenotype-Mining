<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When cells were gamma-irradiated in the presence of calyculin A, a potent inhibitor of the catalytic subunit of phosphatases 1 and 2A, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was shown to be concentration dependent with maximal inhibition occurring at 20nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both DNA fragmentation and the morphological features characteristic of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were prevented by incubation with calyculin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentration required to inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (20 nM) was considerably less than that reported previously for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44658">okadaic acid</z:chebi> (500 nM), also an inhibitor of phosphatase activity as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44658">okadaic acid</z:chebi> caused a marked condensation of nuclear material in both control and irradiated cells, while preventing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, no such changes in chromatin were evident in the presence of calyculin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is clear from these data and other results with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48001">protein synthesis inhibitors</z:chebi> that the complete machinery for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, induced under certain conditions, preexists in the cell, and phosphatase activity plays a key role in this process </plain></SENT>
