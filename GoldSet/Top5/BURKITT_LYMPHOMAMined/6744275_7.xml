<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In four different cell lines originating from patients with lymphocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (Daudi, Raji, H-SB2, and SB), this unique ultrastructural effect displayed a log-linear relationship to increasing doses of interferon-alpha and was dose and time dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TRI morphogenesis began within 12 hr in Daudi or Raji cells exposed continuously to 500 IU of leukocyte interferon/ml, but only at 20 hr after 2- to 4-hr pulse exposures to 50 to 100 IU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TRI accumulation, determined by thin-section counts, reached maximal levels of up to 16% of cell sections within 48 to 72 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiments with Raji cells indicated a decrease in TRI formation during successive cell divisions; detection of TRI after a pulse of interferon was enhanced when DNA replication was arrested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TRI morphogenesis appeared to be independent of several other known biological actions of interferons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It manifested later than the induction of 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity which has been correlated with establishment of the antiviral state and occurred in cell lines, including DaudiKIFNR, which resist the growth-inhibitory effects of leukocyte interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participation of new <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> synthesis was indicated by experiments with inhibitors of transcription (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi>) or translation (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi>): TRI morphogenesis was blocked when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> was added 4 hr after interferon and was reduced when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> was added for the interval of 13 to 23 hr after interferon </plain></SENT>
