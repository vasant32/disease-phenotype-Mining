<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is more resistant to killing by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> than a sub line (Raji TK-) which is Mex- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A reduction in O6-methylguanine (O6MeG)-DNA methyltransferase can be brought about by growing Raji cells in the presence of free O6MeG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in enzyme activity is specific and reversible; removal of O6MeG from the medium results in the restoration of methyltransferase activity within 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Raji cells, in which methyltransferase has been reduced by this treatment to below detectable levels, are not sensitised to killing by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="21759">N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine</z:chebi> or the cross-linking nitrosoureas, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3423">1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea</z:chebi> and 1-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47553">2-chloroethyl</z:chebi>)-1-nitrosourea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This implies that adducts at the O6 atom of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> in DNA are not potentially cytotoxic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondly, it suggests that a defect other than the lack of methyltransferase is responsible for the sensitivity of Mex- cells to killing by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
