<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a phase II window study to examine activity and tolerability of rituximab in newly diagnosed pediatric B-NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients younger than age 19 years with CD20(+) B-NHL with at least one measurable site were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of rituximab at 375 mg/m(2) administered intravenously on day 1; concomitant therapy consisted of rasburicase, intrathecally (IT) triple drug (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>) on days 1 and 3 for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-positive patients and steroids only for <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response criterion was the product of the two largest perpendicular diameters of one to three lesions and/or the percentage of blasts in bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) within 24 hours before rituximab and on day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responders had &gt; or = 25% decrease of at least one lesion or BM or PB blasts and no disease progress at other sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response rate (RR) was set at 45% for unfavorable activity or at 65% for favorable activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From April 2004 to August 2008, 136 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Common Toxicity Criteria 3/4 toxicities attributable to rituximab were general condition, 15%; <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, 13%; <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp>, 7%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, 3%; glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, 8%; no capillary leakage; and no toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine patients were not evaluable for response because of withdrawal from the study (n = 16), IT therapy in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-negative patients (n = 8), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment (n = 3), technical inadequacy of response evaluation (n = 21), or no evaluable lesion (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 87 evaluable patients, 36 were responders (RR, 41.4%; 95% CI, 31% to 52%); among them, 27 of 67 with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and seven of 15 with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A response was more frequently observed in BM (12 of 18) compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> lesions (36 of 108; P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rituximab is active as a single-agent in pediatric B-NHL even though the RR was lower than requested in the phase II plan </plain></SENT>
