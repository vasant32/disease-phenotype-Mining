<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are also the targets of several anticancer agents, indicating their importance in maintaining cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the possibility that alterations in microtubule structure and tubulin polymerization may be part of the cellular response to DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we find that gamma-radiation stimulates the production and polymerization of alpha-, beta-, and gamma- tubulin in hematopoeitic cell lines (Ramos, DP16), leading to visible changes in microtubule structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have found that this microtubule reorganization can be prevented by <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>, a drug that concomitantly inhibits DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results support the idea that microtubule polymerization is an important facet of the mammalian response to DNA damage </plain></SENT>
