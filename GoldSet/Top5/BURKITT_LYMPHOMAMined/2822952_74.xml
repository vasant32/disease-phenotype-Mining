<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This promoter is used in many (but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) human cell lines carrying Epstein-Barr virus, including a tightly latent human lymphoblastoid cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another promoter for the EBNA <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> was described previously in the internal repeat region of the virus genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The existence of these alternative promoters may be important for differential control of EBNA gene expression </plain></SENT>
