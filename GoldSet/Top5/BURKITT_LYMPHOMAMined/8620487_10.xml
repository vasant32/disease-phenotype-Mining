<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A cDNA encoding human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> hydrolase, a member of the cysteine proteinase family of proteins, has been cloned from a human brain cDNA library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The isolated cDNA contains an open reading frame coding for a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> of 456 amino acids that contains <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the structural features characteristic of cysteine proteinases, including the cysteine, histidine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32664">asparagine residues</z:chebi> that are essential for the catalytic properties of these enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deduced amino acid sequence for human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> hydrolase shows 92, 40, and about 35% of identities with those determined for rabbit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> hydrolase, yeast <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> hydrolase, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> aminopeptidase C, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> isolated from a variety of human tissues demonstrated that human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> hydrolase is expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined tissues, which is consistent with a putative role of this protein as a proteolytic enzyme involved in norman cellular protein degradation and turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preliminary expression analysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> hydrolase in different human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showed increased expression of the enzyme in a series of head and neck <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> when compared with paired adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also observed a variable degree of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> hydrolase expression in different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, with low or undetectable levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> samples and higher levels in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with a proposed role for human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> hydrolase in resistance of some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
