<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The following study was a 5-year retrospective review of paediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> as seen at the Jos University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative frequencies of childhood solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumours</z:e> in Jos, Central Nigeria and compare with reports of previous studies both locally and abroad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> registers and medical records of patients were used to extract demographic data, specimen number and/or codes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Archival materials were retrieved from the histopathology laboratory and sections were made from paraffin embedded blocks of these specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Slides of these histological sections were reviewed and reclassified where necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative frequencies were then determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and eighty one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> of children were diagnosed within the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four (51%) were benign and 87 (49%) malignant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Male: Female ratio was 1.3:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The commonest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumour</z:e> diagnosed was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> which accounted for 27 (31%), comprising of 15 (55.6%), 11 (40.7%) and 1 (3.7%) embryonal, alveolar and pleomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcomas</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> accounted for 17 (19.5%) and 12 (13.8%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based on the result of our study, we conclude that the commonest solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> of childhood in Jos, Nigeria is <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This has implications for diagnosis, management and prognosis of theses soft tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> in our paediatric population </plain></SENT>
