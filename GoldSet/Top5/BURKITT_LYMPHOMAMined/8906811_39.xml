<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined whether human blood dendritic cells (DCs) express a functional ligand for CD40 (CD40L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human blood DCs expressed significant amounts of cell surface CD40L identical to that expressed on activated T cells, as detected by mAb to CD40L or a chimeric CD40.Ig fusion protein (CD40.Ig) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stimulation through CD40 up-regulated protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> CD40L expression in DCs, B cells, and B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD40-mediated CD40L expression was inhibited by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi>, herbimycin, in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the induction of CD40L expression via CD40 requires protein tyrosine kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD40L surface expression correlated with constitutive or inducible levels of CD40L-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, as determined by reverse transcribed PCR analysis (RT-PCR) using CD40L-homologous primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CD40L on DCs was functional, since CD40L+ DCs, unlike CD40L- DCs, induced B cell IgG and IgA production, and this induction could be inhibited by blocking CD40L-CD40 interactions with mAb to CD40L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, CD40L on DCs and CD40L induced by crosslinking CD40 may regulate B cell activation and maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The importance of DC CD40L expression on B cell function is discussed </plain></SENT>
