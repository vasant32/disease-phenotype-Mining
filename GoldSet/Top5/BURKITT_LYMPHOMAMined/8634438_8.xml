<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The A-myb gene encodes a transcription factor that is related both functionally and structurally to the v-myb oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following our observations that A-myb is expressed in a restricted subset of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mature human B lymphocytes, with the phenotype CD38+, CD39-, slgM-, we have now investigated the pattern of A-myb expression in neoplastic B cells representating the whole spectrum of B-cell differentiation and compared it to that of c-myb and B-myb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a panel of 32 B-cell lines, A-myb was very strongly expressed in most Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines, but weak or negative in 2 pre-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), 4 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), 6 Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines, and 6 <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein expression paralleled that of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have also investigated A-myb expression in 49 fresh cases of B <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 24 ALL, 6 were of the null and 11 of the common type and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these were negative for A-myb expression; on the other hand, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 B-ALL cases (slg+), as well as one fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> case with bone marrow infiltration, expressed A-myb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A-myb was undetectable in 4 prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi>) but was strongly expressed in 5/20 (25%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the latter A-myb did not correlate with phenotype or clinical stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we have studied the progression of one case of CLL into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349631" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Richter's syndrome</z:e> and have found that the Richter's cells expressed about 25-fold less A-myb <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> than the CLL cells from the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pattern of c-myb and B-myb was clearly distinct from that of A-myb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>C-myb and B-myb were expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neoplastic groups, except in CLL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, A-myb expression, unlike that of c-myb and B-myb, is restricted to a subset of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> (in particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and slg+<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) representative of a specific stage of B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This expression may in part reflect expression of A-myb by the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal center B cells that are the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterpart of these transformed B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The data presented strongly support a role for this transcription factor in B-cell differentiation and perhaps in B-cell transformation in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
