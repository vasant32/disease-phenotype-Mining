<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two infants, whose lymphoblasts at diagnosis were morphologically subtyped as L1 and immunophenotyped as HLA DR+, CD19+, CD10+/- and C mu-, were induced and maintained in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One child relapsed 6 months after initiation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This time his lymphoblasts had L3 <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotyping demonstrated the appearance of surface immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second child relapsed 18 months after initiation of therapy with a lymphomatous picture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He also had peripheral and bone marrow blasts with L3 <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and surface immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A lymph node biopsy showed diffuse small non-cleaved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a 'starry sky' appearance compatible with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one case with a similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> has been reported in the literature, but no surface immunoglobulins were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The significance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> in these cases and its potential practical implications are discussed </plain></SENT>
