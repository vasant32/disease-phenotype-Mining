<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two largest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> are thought to be involved in the attachment of the virus to its receptor on B cells, but despite the fact that gp85 induces neutralizing antibody, no function has been attributed to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As an indirect approach to understanding the role of gp85 in the initiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, we determined the point at which a neutralizing, monoclonal antibody that reacted with the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> interfered with virus replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antibody had no effect on virus binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To examine the effect of the antibody on later stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, the fusion assay of Hoekstra and colleagues (D </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The virus was labeled with a fluorescent amphiphile that was self-quenched at the high concentration obtained in the virus membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the virus and cell membrane fused, there was a measurable relief of self-quenching that could be monitored kinetically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Labeling had no effect on virus binding or infectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The assay could be used to monitor virus fusion with lymphoblastoid lines or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells, and its validity was confirmed by the use of fixed cells and the Molt 4 cell line, which binds but does not internalize the virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal antibody to gp85 that neutralized virus infectivity, but not a second nonneutralizing antibody to the same molecule, inhibited the relief of self-quenching in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that gp85 may play an active role in the fusion of EBV with B-cell membranes </plain></SENT>
