<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We identified seven new recurring translocations among 483 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) with adequate chromosome banding studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four were apparently balanced [t(1;3)(p34;p21), t(7;9)(p15;p23-p24), t(12;13)(p13;q14), t(17;19)(q22;p13)], while three were unbalanced with the formation of a dicentric chromosome [dic(7;9)(p13;p11), dic(7;12)(p11;p12), and dic(12;17)(p11;p11-p12)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One translocation was observed in five cases, two in four cases, and the remaining four in two cases each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The modal chromosome numbers in these 21 cases were 45 (n = 11), 46 (n = 8), and 47 (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 11 cases with a dicentric chromosome had a modal number of 45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only a single translocation was found in 14 cases (67%), representing the sole structural abnormality in six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In three of the seven translocation subgroups, the blast cells were consistently of B lineage (pre-B, early pre-B, or both); in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> others, they represented both the B and T lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The small size of these subgroups prevented definitive clinical correlations, although it may be important that two of the four cases with a t(17;19) and an early pre-B-cell immunophenotype had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo>, an event usually observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> or T-cell ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings add substantially to the existing list of nonrandom chromosomal translocations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> and may help to explain the genetic alterations leading to the loss of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth control mechanisms in this disease </plain></SENT>
