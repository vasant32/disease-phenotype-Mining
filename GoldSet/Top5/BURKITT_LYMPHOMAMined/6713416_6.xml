<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient with very extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1335774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retroperitoneal disease</z:e> prior to surgery had rapid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> regrowth and subsequently died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient has relapsed twice, but is currently alive and has been disease-free for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients have remained in complete remission for 25-63 months from presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major toxic effects encountered in this protocol were mucositis (which necessitated a reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> duration in two patients) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (which complicated chemotherapy in 15 of the total of 79 cycles delivered) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were three documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were diagnosed before chemotherapy was started, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resolved with appropriate antibiotic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 92% actuarial survival rate in this protocol is comparable to results with more prolonged chemotherapy or a combination of prolonged chemotherapy and irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since prolonged maintenance therapy and irradiation were not utilized in our protocol, they appear to be unnecessary for patients with intra-abdominal undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> whose disease can be at least 90% resected </plain></SENT>
