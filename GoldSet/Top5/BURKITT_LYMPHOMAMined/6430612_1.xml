<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report that plasminogen activating factor (PAF) produced by human (P3HR-1) and simian (B95-8) lymphoid cells of malignant origin abrogates lymphocyte cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PAF has been purified from Epstein-Barr (EB) virus genome carrying lymphocyte cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PAF has been purified from Epstein-Barr (EB) virus genome carrying lymphoid lines by affinity chromatography using lysine-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> columns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Purified PAF consistently inhibited Killer cell activity against the following targets: K-562, EB virus superinfected Raji cells and in vitro EB virus transformed autologous B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore PAF also inhibited the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results presented also indicate that PAF affects the effector lymphocytes and not the target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these observations emphasize the importance of factors such as PAF, released by malignant cells, as inhibitors/modulators of immune mechanisms effective against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
