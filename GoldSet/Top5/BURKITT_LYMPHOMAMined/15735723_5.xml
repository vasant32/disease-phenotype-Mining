<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In total, 50-60% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells carry mutant c-Myc proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a mouse model of spontaneously immortalized pro-B-lymphocytes (Ba/F3), we have investigated genomic instability mediated by the conditional expression of either <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) or deletion box II Delta106-Myc proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that both proteins mediate common as well as differing types of chromosomal rearrangements as documented by spectral karyotyping (SKY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A higher level of genomic instability is induced by the Delta106-Myc protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To examine the tumorigenic potential of WT or Delta106-driven Ba/F3 cells, in vivo <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> studies were performed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under the experimental conditions of this study, WT but not Delta106-Myc expressing Ba/F3 cells triggered <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the genomic instability phenotype induced by Delta106-Myc can be genetically uncoupled from its tumorigenic potential </plain></SENT>
