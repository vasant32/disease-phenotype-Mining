<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ab-mediated signaling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) are both considered as relevant effector mechanisms for Abs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address potential interactions between these two mechanisms, we generated HER-2/neu- and CD19-derived chimeric target Ags, which were expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027659" disease_type="Neoplastic Process;Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">experimental tumor</z:e> target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HER-2/neu-directed Abs were documented to mediate effective ADCC with both mononuclear cells (MNCs) and polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs), whereas Abs against CD19 were effective only with MNCs and not with PMNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We generated cDNA encoding HER-2/CD19 or CD19/HER-2 (extracellular/intracellular) chimeric fusion proteins by combining cDNA encoding extracellular domains of HER-2/neu or CD19 with intracellular domains of CD19 or HER-2/neu, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After transfecting <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> HER-2/neu or chimeric HER-2/CD19 into Raji Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> CD19 or chimeric CD19/HER-2 into SK-BR-3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells, target cell lines were selected for high membrane expression of transfected Ags </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then investigated the efficacy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lysis by PMNs or MNCs with CD19- or HER-2/neu-directed Ab constructs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MNCs triggered effective ADCC against target cells expressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or chimeric target Ag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As expected, PMNs killed <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> HER-2/neu-transfected, but not <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> CD19-transfected target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, however, PMNs were also effective against chimeric CD19/HER-2-transfected, but not HER-2/CD19-transfected target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results demonstrate that intracellular domains of target Ags contribute substantially to effective Ab-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell killing by PMNs </plain></SENT>
