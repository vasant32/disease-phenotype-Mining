<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> epidemic on the incidence of Kaposi <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> (KS) and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in Ontario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Age-standardized incidence rates for KS and NHL from 1981 to 2000 were calculated from the population-based Ontario <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> cases were extracted from Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HIV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> data were obtained from the Ontario <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KS was a rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> before the 1980s; however, incidence increased sharply between 1985 and 1995 by 13.8% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, incidence rates fell close to those in the early 1980s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NHL incidence in males increased steadily during the 1980s at 3.2% per year and then slowed beyond 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In males aged 30-44, NHL incidence rose from 1981 to 1990 (8.8% per year) and then fell (-2.5%) thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NHL and KS cases represented one-third of HIV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> epidemic, the introduction of antiretroviral therapies, and the decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> rates explain the rise and decline of KS incidence in Ontario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NHL incidence trends are more complex, although the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> epidemic explains the trends observed in younger men (in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> is more common), and for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related subtypes </plain></SENT>
