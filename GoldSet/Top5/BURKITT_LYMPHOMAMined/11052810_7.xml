<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the family of cytokines and cytokine receptors, alternative splicing of pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is a frequently observed process that generates different protein isoforms from a single genetic locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The splicing-derived cytokine receptor protein isoforms are mostly soluble receptors or show alterations in their cytoplasmic domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is possible that receptor abnormalities or a pathological ratio of different isoforms may contribute to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> by circumventing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth factor control or altering the balance of proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-7 plays a critical role in early stages of both B and T cell maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it stimulates the expansion of mature T cells including anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> reactive cells as well as a number of T and B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> underlining its potential importance for deregulated lymphoid proliferation and leukaemogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we present detailed data on the expression of the interleukin 7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7Ralpha) in leukaemic cells from 210 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) and describe two novel alternatively spliced transcripts of human IL-7Ralpha coding for truncated receptor proteins which are still capable of binding IL-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-7Ralpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was more frequent in more mature <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> [91% (30/33)] than in common [81% (81/100)] or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pro-B ALL</z:e> [64% (18/28)], or even in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T ALL</z:e> [64% (29/45)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are in concordance with flow cytometric analyses on the proportion of IL-7Ralpha bearing cells among total blast cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results lead us to assume that splicing derived IL-7Ralpha isoforms play a potential role in modulating IL-7 signal transduction and might be important for the pathogenesis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
