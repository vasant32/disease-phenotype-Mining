<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the cytotoxic and apoptogenic activities, the phytochemical composition and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxicity of the aqueous extract of Bryonia dioica roots growing in Algeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dried roots of Bryonia dioica were extracted with water (decoction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic effects of the aqueous extract in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> BL41 cell lines were evaluated by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> induction was assessed by two corroborative assays; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI) staining of cell DNA and flow cytometric light scatter analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mitochondria membrane potential was investigated using a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi> DIOC6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of caspases-3, -8, -9 and PARP was assessed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The phytochemical screening of the roots of Bryonia dioica was performed using qualitative phytochemical standard procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Bryonia dioica aqueous extract induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The IC50 of Bryonia dioica aqueous extract was estimated to be approximately 15, 63Î¼g/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, activation of caspase-3 and -9, cleavage of PARP and loss of mitochondria membrane potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the phytochemical screening of roots of Bryonia dioica showed the presence of various bioactive such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenols</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterols</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35191">triterpenes</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22315">alkaloids</z:chebi>, c-heterosides, carbohydrates and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26605">saponins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The aqueous extract of Bryonia dioica induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> BL41 cell lines via the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterols</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35191">triterpens</z:chebi> detected could be responsible for the cytotoxic and apoptogenic activities of the aqueous extract of Bryonia dioica </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that Bryonia dioica could be considered as a promising source for developing novel therapeutics against Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
