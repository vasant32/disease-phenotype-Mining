<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was established histologically according to WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> represented 50% of NHL in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were staged according to Ziegler's system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age of patients was 5.5 years with a sex (M/F) ratio of 2.1/1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common primary site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> involvement was the abdomen (69.4%), which was followed by facial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, in particular the jaw and orbit (49.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 21 cases with jaw (29.1%) and 15 cases with orbital involvement (20.8%) at initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients (84.4%) were in advanced stages (C and D) at initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Facial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> observed in Turkish children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were more similar to African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than American or European cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High titers of antibodies against VCA and EA of EBV were also seen in our recent cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two main treatment regimens, namely, single agent chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CYX) (1968-1974) and three drug (COM) combination chemotherapy, were used consecutively (1974-1988) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>COM has been shown to produce better results than single agent therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation, mean age, and high antibodies (IgG) to EBV and preliminary molecular studies revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> appears to be in between African and non-African types in Turkish children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This will be further elucidated by direct examination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells for EBV and investigation of the molecular characteristics of Turkish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Such studies are presently under way </plain></SENT>
