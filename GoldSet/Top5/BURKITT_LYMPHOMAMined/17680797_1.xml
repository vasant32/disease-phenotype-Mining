<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to discover if Mycoplasma fermentans, which is known to infect B cells, could be the cause of the raised ecto-5'-nucleotidase observed in the synovial fluid of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity in the patients' serum has been shown to correlate with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and DNA from the mycoplasma has been found in the synovial fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>B lymphoblastoid cell lines were exposed to 16 strains of Mycoplasma fermentans and their ecto-5'-nucleotidase, CD73, was measured both biochemically and by mouse antibodies to human ecto 5'-nucleotidase using the fluorescence activated cell sorter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The type strain, PG 18, did not grow with the B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of the mycoplasma strains (9/15) increased the cellular ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity from twice to 17 fold, and usually showed 5'-nucleotidase activity themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At least one strain, M106, induced human 5'-nucleotidase on the normally 5'-nucleotidase negative Daudi and Raji Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, and increased sevenfold the 5'-nucleotidase on the monocyte/macrophage cell line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Growing the cells in aged medium increased the level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026936" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mycoplasma infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This mycoplasma-induced enzyme showed a conformational change and an increase in activity with a glycosylation change involving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other group of strains, mostly of respiratory or cell culture origin, usually did not have any 5'-nucleotidase of their own and decreased the B-cell enzyme activity by about half </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy and flow cytometry showed that the strain M106 was filamentous and could be found inside the B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 5'-nucleotidase-inducing strains of M. fermentans may be important in the aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
