<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present work gp40 was partially purified from a pool of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>/NPC sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and NPC as well as sera of patients with other malignant and non-malignant diseases were tested for antibodies against gp40, using a double antibody radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Practically <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sera and sera of patients with non-malignant diseases had antibodies capable of binding radioiodinated gp40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, sera of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> or NPC had very low binding, while sera of patients with other malignant diseases had intermediate binding values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The low binding activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>/NPC sera was shown to be due to inhibition by excess gp40 present in such sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Effusions of patients with breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> also contained demonstrable amounts of gp40 </plain></SENT>
