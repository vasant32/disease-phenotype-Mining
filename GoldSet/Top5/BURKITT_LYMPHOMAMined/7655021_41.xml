<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These proteins play an important role in regulating cell-cycle progression and loss of their function has been implicated in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) may induce cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> through p27 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta often loses its ability to arrest growth of transformed cells; this could potentially occur through a defect in p27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of p27 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, we examined its mutational status in 74 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) (52 of B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, 22 of T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>), 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, and 42 adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (ATLs) using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and Southern blot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A nonsense mutation (stop codon) that could result in expression of a truncated nonfunctional p27 protein was detected at codon 76 in one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphomatous ATL, but not in matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Previously undescribed polymorphisms were also identified at codon 109 in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and at codon 55 in the ATLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two homozygous deletions of the p27 gene were detected in one case of B-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> NHL and in one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ATL by Southern blot hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that p27 gene alterations are rare events in NHLs and ATLs, but may play an important role in the pathogenesis of some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
