<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Leukemic cells from 104 of 681 patients (15.3%) were able to engraft and proliferate in one or more <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mouse organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>+ patients were somewhat more likely than <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> patients to be older than 10 years of age (p = 0.03) and have WBC counts &gt;20,000/microL (p = 0.04), but the groups were similar with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other presenting features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival (EFS) outcome at 3 years of follow-up was similar for <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>+ patients compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>- patients (79.2%, SD = 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1% vs. 84.8%, SD = 2.8%; p = 0.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival also was similar between the two groups (p = 0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This result was maintained within the subgroups of lower risk (N = 448) and higher risk (N = 233) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there were trends for poorer outcome among patients whose cells caused overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice and infiltrated either 6 or more organs (p = 0.03), skeletal muscle (p = 0.0003), kidney (p = 0.05), or spleen (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, engraftment of primary leukemic cells in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice was not a significant predictor of outcome for the aggregate population of B-lineage ALL patients, the majority of whom were low risk, treated according to contemporary intensive chemotherapy programs of the CCG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, development of disseminated overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and infiltration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mouse skeletal muscle by primary leukemic cells from adjacent bone marrow may reflect a biologically more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> and identify patients at higher risk for treatment failure </plain></SENT>
