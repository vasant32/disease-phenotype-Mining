<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: More than 95% of children with B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) achieve a clinical remission after the induction phase of chemotherapy (first 28 days) as evaluated by morphologic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, relapse occurs in approximately 30% of these children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether the outcome of patients in clinical remission at the end of induction therapy could be predicted using a highly sensitive method to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children diagnosed with B-lineage ALL at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia during a 2-year period were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was quantitated in remission marrow samples obtained at the end of induction therapy in 44 children using a phage clonogenic assay in association with complementarity-determining-region 3 (CDR3)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Residual disease</z:e> was a significant predictor of outcome independent of WBC count, age, or sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The estimated relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) during therapy was 50.4% (+/- 12.6%) for patients with high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> (&gt; or = 0.6% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells among total marrow B cells) versus 91.9% (+/- 5.5%) for those with lower levels (P &lt; .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in off-treatment <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> between patients with high or low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> who completed therapy in continuous remission (P = .82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall estimated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> was 32.3% (+/- 11.6%) for patients with high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> versus 62.6% (+/- 10.7%) for patients with lower levels of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, with a median follow-up of 5.3 years for patients in continuous remission (P &lt; .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PCR detection of high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> at the end of induction therapy identifies patients at increased risk for relapse during therapy </plain></SENT>
