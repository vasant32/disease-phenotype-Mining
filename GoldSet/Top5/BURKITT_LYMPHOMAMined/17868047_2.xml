<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to assess the prevalence, clinical presentation and treatment results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infants who were diagnosed with NHL between October 1986 and December 2002 among 2084 patients treated according to the NHL-BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster) multicentre trials 86, 90 and 95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 20 (1%) infants with NHL including five with T-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (T-cell LBL), seven with precursor B-cell LBL (pB-cell LBL), two with a mature Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, five with anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e>) and one with peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> patient, 3/7 pB-cell LBL and 1/5 ALCL patients relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient each from the T-cell LBL and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> groups suffered from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancy</z:e> and one patient each with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> and Burkitt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> died from treatment-related toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year event-free survival rate was 53 +/- 12% for the 20 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study has provided preliminary evidence that infants with NHL have a dismal prognosis and showed that infant NHL differed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in older patients with respect to the distribution of gender, histopathologic subtypes as well as the ratio of T- to pB-cell LBL and the frequency of relapses of pB-cell LBL </plain></SENT>
