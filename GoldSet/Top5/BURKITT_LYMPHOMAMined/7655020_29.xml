<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated that a candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene resides telomeric of the RB1 gene at 13q14, a region that is commonly deleted in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have evaluated the frequency and minimal region of overlap for 13q deletions in malignant cells from various lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed losses at 13q14 in 33/75 (44%) B-CLL cases, four of 16 (25%) non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) cases, eight of 29 (28%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), and one of 15 T-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some ALL cases, inactivation of the RB1 gene is suggested as the important event in the 13q deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most commonly deleted marker in CLL and NHL was D13S319, between RBkpt and the D13S25 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Homozygous deletions of this marker were observed in 10 of 75 B-CLL cases, in six of which the homozygous deletions included only the D13S319 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that 13q deletions are common in lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and that deletion of a candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene(s) in the vicinity of the D13S319 marker is a tumorigenic event in these diseases </plain></SENT>
