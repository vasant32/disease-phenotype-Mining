<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that H-DNA-forming sequences are intrinsically mutagenic in mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that DNA is a causative factor in mutagenesis and not just the end product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using the endogenous H-DNA-forming sequence found in the human c-myc promoter, mutation frequencies in a reporter gene were increased approximately 20-fold over background in COS-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>H-DNA-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) were detected near the H-DNA locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The structures of the mutants revealed microhomologies at the breakpoints, consistent with a nonhomologous end-joining repair of the DSBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results implicate H-DNA-induced DSBs in c-myc gene translocations in diseases such as Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and t(12;15) BALB/c <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo>, where most breakpoints are found near the H-DNA-forming site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, our findings suggest that H-DNA is a source of genetic instability resulting from DSBs and demonstrate that naturally occurring DNA sequences are mutagenic in mammals, perhaps contributing to genetic evolution and disease </plain></SENT>
