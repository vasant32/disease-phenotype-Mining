<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radioimmune and immunofluorescence binding assays identified two antibodies, MHM6 and AC2, which reacted consistently with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EB-LCL tested, with a subpopulation of cells in some but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EB virus genome-positive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, but with none of a range of EB virus genome-negative cell lines of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While MHM6 appeared to bind an EB virus-related antigen, AC2 bound some other cell surface antigen which was also found on a small subpopulation of cells in lymphocyte cultures stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin or with pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MHM6 and AC2 recognized single <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> with apparent molecular weights of 45 kd and 80 kd respectively as shown by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecylsulphate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE) analysis of 125I-labeled cell surface <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> immunoprecipitated with these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were induced on experimentally-infected B cells within 24 h of the expression of the EB virus nuclear antigen, EBNA, at a time known to coincide with the appearance of the lymphocyte-detected membrane antigen, LYDMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, saturating concentration of MHM6 and AC2 were unable to protect EB-LCL target cells from lysis by LYDMA-specific cytotoxic T cells in a <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi>-release assay </plain></SENT>
