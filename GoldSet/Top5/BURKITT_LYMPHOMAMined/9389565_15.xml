<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe 4 cases with histologically confirmed malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> arising in the Birmingham liver transplant programme between 1982 and 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One was an EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 were EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and the 4th was an EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed expression of the EBV-encoded latent membrane protein LMP1 and of the BZLF1 trans-activator protein in 2 cases each, whereas the virus-encoded nuclear antigen EBNA2 was not detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> available post-transplant biopsies from the 3 patients with EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were then studied to test whether the detection of EBV-positive cells in liver allograft biopsies could be used to identify patients at risk for the development of PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients showed infrequent EBV-positive cells in liver allograft biopsies up to 14 months before the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a marked increase in the number of such cells at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple biopsies from the 3rd patient did not reveal any EBV-carrying cells in the entire post-transplant period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate a low incidence of PTLD in the Birmingham liver transplant programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PTLDs were morphologically high-grade malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 3 cases were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, and these showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> patterns of EBV latent protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results also suggest that the examination of liver allograft biopsies using EBER in situ hybridisation is not an appropriate method for identifying patients at risk of developing PTLD </plain></SENT>
