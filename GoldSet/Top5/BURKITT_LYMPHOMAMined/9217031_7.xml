<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100243'>leiomyosarcoma</z:hpo> in children with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) and in organ transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether EBV is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100243'>leiomyosarcoma</z:hpo> in HIV negative patients, the authors examined resected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100243'>leiomyosarcomas</z:hpo> for EBV and HIV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four <z:hpo ids='HP_0100243'>leiomyosarcomas</z:hpo> were studied and their diagnosis confirmed on pathologic review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From these specimens DNA was isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> samples were analyzed for EBV and HIV using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique followed by gel electrophoresis and Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA from an EBV-infected human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line and peripheral blood from an HIV positive patient were used as positive controls for the presence of EBV and HIV, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed using an antibody to Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HIV was not present in any of the patients analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EBV DNA was detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue; however, 80 cycles of PCR were used before EBV sequences were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the data indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue was not infected with EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The positive results observed after 80 cycles of PCR were likely due to infiltrating lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry confirmed the lack of active or latent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that EBV is not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100243'>leiomyosarcoma</z:hpo> in HIV negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the biology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100243'>leiomyosarcoma</z:hpo> associated with HIV may be substantially different from the more common <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> form </plain></SENT>
