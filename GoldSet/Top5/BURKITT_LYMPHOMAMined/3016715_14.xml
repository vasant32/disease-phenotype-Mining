<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Potential antigenic sites in the amino acid sequence of these proteins were selected by computer-aided prediction of the secondary structure and two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25676">oligopeptides</z:chebi> corresponding to regions located in different parts of the proteins were synthesized chemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rabbit antisera to these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were used for immunoprecipitation of the native <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> proteins from Epstein-Barr virus-positive cell lines from various sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both predicted membrane proteins could be precipitated from cell lines that had been transformed in vitro with EBV or from cell lines derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cell lines established from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, only the smaller <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>, which lacks 138 amino acids from the amino terminus, could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> as antigens in ELISA, we detected elevated antibody titers in sera from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
