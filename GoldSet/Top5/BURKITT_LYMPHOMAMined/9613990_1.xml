<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four of the seven patients were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distribution of positive staining within the cell was predominantly in the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reactivity of PAb240 was weaker than that of the other antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, three of the four positive cases showed the same abnormal karyotype; translocation (8;14) (q24;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the four positive cases died due to relapse of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The three negative cases did not show karyotypic abnormalities and are still alive and well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, p53 immunostaining technique may be useful for predicting the clinical outcome of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
