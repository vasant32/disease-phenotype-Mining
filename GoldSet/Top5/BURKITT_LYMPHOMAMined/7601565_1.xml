<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B lymphoblastoid cell lines secreting specific antibodies were fused with (mouse x human) heteromyeloma SHM-D33 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the large number of hybridomas generated, one which produced a human monoclonal antibody (MAb) TONO-1 (IgM, lambda) was selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAb TONO-1 proved to be reactive with 4 human T-cell lines, HPB-MLT, L-MAT, MOLT-3 and MOLT-4F, but not with B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> or non-hematopoietic malignant cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAb TONO-1 reacted positively with fresh <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells from 2 of 7 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> T-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, but no reaction was observed in non-T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, red blood cells and platelets in the peripheral blood did not demonstrate remarkable binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither thymocytes nor bone-marrow cells from healthy volunteers were reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The antigens defined by MAb TONO-1 were <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> of 57 kDa and 68 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistological studies revealed no staining of thymocytes in the thymus of a 6-month-old child, but showed epithelial reticular cells and Hassall's corpuscles to stain positively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that MAb TONO-1 is directed to T-leukemic cells and some components of thymus tissue </plain></SENT>
