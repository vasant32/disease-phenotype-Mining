<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In BFM 90, primary prophylaxis with Granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor was used, postinduction treatment was started at granulocytes &gt; or =0.5 x 10(9)/L (&gt; or =1.0 x 10(9)/L in NHL 86) with a higher mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> dose (2.9 g/m(2)/cycle, n = 23; 1.6 g/m(2)/cycle in NHL 86, n = 22, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intervals between consecutive treatment-cycles were shorter in BFM 90 (P &lt; 0.001) with no additional toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the two-year failure-free survival with BFM 90 (82%) was similar to that achieved with NHL 86 (72%, P = 0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that BFM 90 enables safe intensification of therapy in young adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> compared to NHL 86, but registry-based studies are required to further evaluate the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> effects and cost-effectiveness of the two therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
