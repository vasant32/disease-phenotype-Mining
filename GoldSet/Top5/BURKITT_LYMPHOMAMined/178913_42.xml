<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three strains of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), two from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and one from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (IM) were used to transform separate cultures of the same batch of primary marmoset leukocytes, and the viruses released from the transformants were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The three viruses shared properties of the transforming biotype of EBV, namely, stimulation of DNA synthesis and immortalization of cord blood leukocytes, and failure to induce "early antigen" in lymphoblast lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> viruses produced more virus in transformed marmoset cells than in transformed human cells, as measured by the number of EBV genomes detected by complementary <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>/DNA hybridization, by virus capsid antigen expression, or by released virions and biologically active virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reference human sera and sera from primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infections</z:e> were used to compare the three virus strains in a virus neutralization test based on inhibition of stimulation of DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specimens taken late in convalescence from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mononucleosis</z:e> and sera from marmosets experimentally infected with virus from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mononucleosis</z:e> neutralized the homologous virus, as well as the two virus strains isolated from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding indicates that <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigens that elicit neutralizing antibodies are shared among the strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in certain sera the neutralizing-antibody titer against one strain was consistently higher than against another strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, sera taken early after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of IM contained low levels of neutralizing antibody against IM-derived virus, but failed to neutralize <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-derived virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These latter findings suggest the existence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among surface antigens of EBVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results emphasize the biological and antigenic similarity of EBV isolates from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and IM and do not suggest major subtype variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It remains to be determined whether antigenic diversity such as described or virus genome variation detectable by other means is epidemiologically significant </plain></SENT>
