<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that Raji cells are <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase deficient that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> has a synergistic effect on the toxicity of pyrazofurin towards these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase deficient cells, affecting both the proliferation and the viability of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indirect evidences suggest that this synergistic toxicity is not mediated by an effect on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16862">nucleoside diphosphate</z:chebi> reductase nor on the first steps of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> de novo synthesis </plain></SENT>
