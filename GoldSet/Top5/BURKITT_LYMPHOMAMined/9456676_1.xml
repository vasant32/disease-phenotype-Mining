<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: During the period 1991-1995, six cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> presenting in the oral cavity were diagnosed in this clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six patients were men ranging in age from 36 to 62 years with CD4 counts below 100 cells mm-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In five patients, oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the first <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> defining disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four lesions occurred on the gingiva, one on the palate and one on the tongue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The duration of symptoms prior to presentation ranged from 2 weeks to 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient, the lesions presented as red, exophytic masses and were diagnosed clinically as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the five lesions presenting on the palate or gingiva showed radiographic evidence of bone destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Metastatic work-up failed to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> elsewhere in the five cases where this was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histological diagnoses included two small, non-cleaved (Burkitt's type) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, one large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and one small, non-cleaved (non-Burkitt's) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the uncommon clinical presentation of this disease and despite its relative rarity, demonstrate the need to maintain a high degree of suspicion in any unusual oral lesion in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
