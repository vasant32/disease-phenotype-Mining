<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In contrast to other human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in which the c-myc gene and its transcript are greatly amplified, careful analysis of t(8;14) Burkitt cell lines indicates that the c-myc transcript is marginally, and in some cases not at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, increased by comparison to control lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Instead, there is a more subtle alteration in the expression of the translocated c-myc gene characterized by a shift in promoter utilization and an apparent insensitivity to the regulation that inactivates the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc allele within these same cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In some Burkitt cell lines, such deregulation might be because of the loss of a putative control region through removal of the large dual promoter/leader segment of the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In other cell lines, however, this deregulation may be explained by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> that occur within the putative control region even though it is located many hundreds of bases from the translocation breakpoint </plain></SENT>
