<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines divided at least twice in BrdU-containing medium and made DNA in which over 90% of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> residues were substituted with analog in both strands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e>-derived lines and 24 lines transformed in vitro were inhibited by BrdU after one cell division and made only hybrid DNA in which one strand was substituted with analog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One out of eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals from whom long term lines were prepared gave cell lines which divided at least twice in BrdU and gave DNA in which both strands were substituted with analog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It would appear that intrinsic cellular factors regulate the response to BrdU and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumor</z:e> lines are characterized by their ability to make stable doubly substituted DNA containing a high proportion of halogenated analog </plain></SENT>
