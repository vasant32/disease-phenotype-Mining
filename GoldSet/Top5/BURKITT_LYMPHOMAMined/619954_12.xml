<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant evidence of space-time clustering of cases, first reported for the period 1961-65, was also present during 1972-73, but not during other periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients involved in such clusters were found to be older than other patients (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average annual incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in the District was 2.45 x 10(-5) and overall there was no change in the incidence during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there were statistically significant changes in incidence in different counties, which could not be explained as case-ascertainment artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One sib pair of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> was found and the series also included 7 instances of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in two cousins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that study of variation in the intensity and type of malarial infestation in different areas at different times may help explain the epidemiological findings and suggest what, if any, aspects of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> are critical for inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
