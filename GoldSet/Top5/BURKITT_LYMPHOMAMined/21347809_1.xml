<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a CD20-CD22 bispecific antibody (Bs20x22) from anti-CD20 and the anti-CD22 monoclonal antibodies (mAb), rituximab and HB22.7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bs20x22 was constructed using standard methods and was shown to specifically bind CD20 and CD22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro cytotoxicity assays showed that Bs20x22 was three times more effective than either parent mAb alone and twice as effective as a combination of both parent mAb used at equimolar concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bs20x22 was also nearly four times more effective at inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> than either mAb alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Examination of the MAPK and SAPK signaling cascades revealed that Bs20x22 induced significantly more p38 phosphorylation than either mAb alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an in vivo human NHL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e>, treatment with Bs20x22 resulted in significantly greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> shrinkage and improved overall survival when compared to either mAb alone or treatment with a combination of HB22.7 and rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of the initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume was assessed by comparing the efficacy of Bs20x22 administered before xenografts grew versus treatment of established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>; significantly, greater efficacy was found when treatment was initiated before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> could become established </plain></SENT>
