<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal antibody reactive with the immunoglobulin heavy chain (TEC IgM) has been conjugated to saporin-6 (SAP), which is the major ribosome-inactivating protein from the seeds of the plant Saponaria officinalis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Bjab 113 demonstrate that this immunotoxin is capable of killing 3 logs (99.9%) of clonogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells after a 2-hour incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of human bone marrow inhibits the activity of the conjugate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, full potency of TEC IgM-SAP immunotoxin is restored by adding 1 mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2618">amantadine</z:chebi> to the incubation medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reaction is highly specific and is inhibited by the presence of excess anti-mu-antibody or human serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clonal growth of other Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines is inhibited to a lesser extent by the immunotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of surface IgM on the different cell lines is directly correlated to target cell killing by TEC IgM-SAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isolation of Bjab 113 clones surviving treatment demonstrates that only a minority are truly resistant and that the others randomly escape the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highly potent and specific activity of this conjugate in the presence of bone marrow buffy coat and its exceptionally rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of action make this conjugate a good candidate for the ex vivo elimination of neoplastic cells from the bone marrow of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
