<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases belong to one of the three major histologic types: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> or large noncleaved cell, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or small noncleaved cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some cases that are polymorphic are termed high-grade B-cell, not otherwise specified (NOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors determined the immunophenotype of each histologic category of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>)-related non-Hodgkins' <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and sought a relationship with the presence of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B-cell differentiation antigens, activation marker expression (human leukocyte antigen-DR, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD30, CD38), and epithelial membrane antigen were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clonality was determined by the detection of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin, surface immunoglobulin, and the analysis of joining region (JH) immunoglobulin gene configuration by Southern blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus was detected either by Southern blot analysis using BamHI W probe fragment or by in situ hybridization with EBV-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcripts-1 specific probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotypic and genotypic results were compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> results and with the presence or absence of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were associated with EBV in 50% of cases, were monoclonal, and expressed mostly immunoglobulin (Ig) MK, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, and CD38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This immunophenotypic profile closely resembled those of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> cases (large noncleaved cell), in which EBV was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus was associated with 90% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> cases, and only CD10, CD20, and CD38 were expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CD71 was expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> categories of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and CD21 and CD23 were rarely expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and one case of high-grade B-NOS were polyclonal regarding JH rearrangement, but EBV tested with 1.9-Kb Xhol fragment was clonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No significant immunophenotypic changes were noted in relation to the presence of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Such studies comparing <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, immunophenotype, and genotype could help classify and better understand the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
