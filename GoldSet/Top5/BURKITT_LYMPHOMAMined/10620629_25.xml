<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 family proteins are central to the regulation of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and modulate drug sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated how survival signals in the cellular microenvironment affect the expression, protein conformation, and protein-protein interactions of the Bcl-2 family proteins Bax and Bcl-x(L) and how changes in response to microenvironmental signals alter the response of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells to the drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: JLP119 human B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (40 microM) and then cultured in the presence of an activating anti-CD40 antibody, vascular cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (VCAM-1)-to activate VLA-4 (alpha4beta1) integrin, and interleukin 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell fate was monitored after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> treatment with or without these microenvironmental signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl-x(L) gene transcription and protein levels of Bcl-x(L) and Bax were measured by northern and western blotting, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nuclear translocation of transcription factor NF-kappaB was monitored by immunofluorescence and inhibited by (E)-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bax conformation and Bax-Bcl-x(L) interactions were monitored by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microenvironmental survival signals produced statistically significant reductions in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>-induced apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, from 84.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 76.7%-92.4%) to 21.3% (95% CI = 19.5%-23.0%); P&lt;.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Activation of surface protein CD40 increased Bcl-x(L) protein levels via an (E)-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi>-inhibitable activation of NF-kappaB; i.e. , (E)-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> restored <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 4 had no effect on Bcl-x(L) protein levels but accelerated the increase in Bcl-x(L) protein associated with CD40 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>VCAM-1- and interleukin 4-mediated signals diminished conformational changes in Bax protein and prevented the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>-induced disruption of constitutive Bax-Bcl-x(L) binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microenvironmental factors reduce the sensitivity of a B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> in vitro by modulating the expression and functions of Bax and Bcl-x(L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This interaction may provide a paradigm for epigenetically induced drug resistance in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
