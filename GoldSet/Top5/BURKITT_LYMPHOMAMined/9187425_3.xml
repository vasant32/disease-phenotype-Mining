<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The product of the c-myc proto-oncogene is a highly conserved nuclear phosphoprotein whose expression is closely linked to cellular proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have been interested in developing an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) strategy to inhibit the proliferation of c-myc-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> for use in future specific therapies and bone marrow purging regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our experimental approach was to incubate either antisense or sense ODNs, spanning the 5' cap region of the c-myc gene, with c-myc overexpressing cell lines (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60) Raji, MJBL, CA-46) for up to seven days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proliferation assay to test the inhibitory effect of an unmodified antisense ODN 15-mer (GCACAGCTCGGGGGT) showed that concentrations as low as 50 micrograms/ml significantly decreased proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells by approximately 40% (P &lt; 0.0001; n = 6) compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clonogenic assays showed that the same antisense ODN inhibited colony formation by MJBL (40%0 and Raji (52%) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent experiments to study the effect of a more nuclease-stable, phosphorothioate-modified antisense ODN 18-mer (GCAGCACAGCTCGGGGGT) revealed 66% inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cell proliferation at 96 and 120 hours at 50 micrograms/ml, whereas sense ODN control had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, tenfold less of the modified antisense ODN (1 micrograms/ml) was required to inhibit proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells by 50% compared to the unmodified antisense ODN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A decrease in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 native c-myc protein level was also observed with 100 micrograms/ml of modified antisense ODN, but not with the sense ODN control, by immunoblot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, concentrations up to 10 micrograms/ml of either modified antisense or sense ODN did not decrease CFU-GM formation (145 +/- 35%, P = 0.27) in human bone marrow, suggesting that these levels of ODN would have a negligible effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These pilot data suggest that modified antisense ODN directed at the cap region of the c-myc gene could specifically inhibit c-myc expression at a single, lower dose than unmodified ODN and may play a future role in inhibiting the growth of c-myc-dependent malignant cells </plain></SENT>
