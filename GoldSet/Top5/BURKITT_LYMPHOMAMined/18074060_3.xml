<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and demographic characteristics of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients diagnosed at the Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Unit at the Instituto Materno-Infantil Professor Fernando Figueira (IMIP) over a 9-year period, and also to describe their survival rates and possible associations between the survival rates and the clinical and demographic characteristics analyzed in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were collected by a retrospective review of the charts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 110 patients admitted to our unit during the period of May 1994 through May 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Probability of survival was calculated in accordance with the techniques of Kaplan-Meier, using log rank to evaluate differences between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average age was 6.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The male/female ratio was 2.4:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent histological subtype was Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients had been diagnosed with advanced disease (stage III or IV of Murphy's Classification) and was from rural areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Family income per capita was lower than 1/2 minimum wage in 36.4% of cases; maternal illiteracy was observed in 12.7% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 70+/-4% and 68.4+/-4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the clinical-demographic characteristics had a significant association with the probability of survival (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Children admitted to the IMIP seemed to be affected by non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at a younger age, with a higher incidence of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and with survival rates similar to those described in the literature of developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No clinical demographic characteristics had a statistically significant association with prognosis </plain></SENT>
