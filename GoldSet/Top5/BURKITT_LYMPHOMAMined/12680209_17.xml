<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Pim-1 33-kDa protein is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is capable of enhancing the rate of occurrence of c-Myc-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and functions to block factor-withdrawal and genotoxic stress-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples and tissue culture cells to examine the cellular location of this protein and its mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that Pim-1 can be located in the cytoplasm, the cytoplasm and nucleus, or the nucleus of cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymph nodes, but is only located in the nucleus in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On transfection of Pim-1 into HeLa cells, a nuclear localization is observed that is not dependent upon kinase activity, but appears to be regulated by the carboxy terminal half of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because Pim-1 is known to regulate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and human Mdm2 (HDM2) contains a consensus Pim-1 phosphorylation site, the possible role of Pim-1 in modulating HDM2 was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When Pim-1 and HDM2 are transfected transiently into 293 cells, the presence of Pim-1 results in an increase in the levels of the HDM2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect requires the presence of the entire HDM2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Export of Pim-1 out of the nucleus by attachment of a nuclear export signal decreased its ability to regulate the levels of HDM2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The nuclear location of Pim-1 is essential for its regulation of the levels of HDM2 protein, and possibly for additional biological activities of this protein kinase </plain></SENT>
