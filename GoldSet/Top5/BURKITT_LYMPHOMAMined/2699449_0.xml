<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this report, the production and modulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> inhibitor (HFDI) derived from human embryonic myofibroblasts were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HFDI was obtained from 3/30 cultures of human embryonic myofibroblasts, which was obviously lower than the incidences of Australia Caucasian's myofibroblast (6/6) and adult's skin fibroblast (4/6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> play certain role in HFDI production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Calf serum had a significant effect on HFDI production, though without any linear relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It seems that HFDI is not derived from calf serum but the factors influencing the production of HFDI are in the calf serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HFDI could be induced by inactivated BCG from non- or low-producing myofibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is indicated that the production of HFDI is related to <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> contamination (in vitro) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (in vivo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis is proposed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> inhibitors be induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> from the fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HFDI-like activity was identified in 4 healthy donors' sera suggesting that HFDI could enter the blood </plain></SENT>
