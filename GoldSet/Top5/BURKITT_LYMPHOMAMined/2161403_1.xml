<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence revealed strong reactivity of the antibodies with EBV-CLL-1 cells and with most lymphocytes in tonsil follicles, in the intestinal wall, around splenic arterioles and near Hassall's corpuscles in the neonatal thymus as well as with a small proportion of lymphocytes in some large reactive lymph node follicles, weak reactivity with 1/5 of peripheral blood B lymphocytes (PBL), and no reactivity with platelets, granulocytes and non-lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PBL from 3 CLL patients showed weak staining of only larger cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intense fluorescence was observed in several non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of various histological types and in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines but not in the 3 T lymphoblastoid and 12 nonlymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lines examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antibodies precipitated Mr 22,000 and 33,000 bands from surface labeled RAJI or EBV-CLL-1 cells and cross-competed in a binding inhibition assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The antibodies had approximately 6 million binding sites per EBV-CLL-1 or RAJI cell but were not cytotoxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This high antigen-density and limited expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells may permit their use for immunocytological diagnosis and targeting cytotoxic agents and radionuclides against appropriate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
