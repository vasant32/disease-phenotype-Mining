<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify matrix constituents that could be involved in the tissue dissemination of neoplastic B cells, we have examined the ability of three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B-cell lines and one Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive cell line established from the lymphoid transformation of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) to adhere to a range of purified ECM molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotyping with a panel of markers suggested that the lines derived from cells that had undergone transformation at distinct stages of B-cell maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The four cell lines displayed a differential ability to adhere to the ECM molecules tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BV-173, Ci-1, and Sc-1 cells attached to various degrees to fibronectin (FN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ri-1, Ci-1, and Sc-1 cells attached to human laminin (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) variants, whereas only Ci-1 and Sc-1 cells showed some affinity for collagen (Col) type VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four cell lines interacted with fibrillar Col I, but only BV-173 and Ri-1 cells attached to fibrillar Col III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subendothelial Col VIII only was active as a substratum for BV-173 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, cells bound to fibrillar collagens when they were assembled into polymeric fibrils, and were incapable of adhering to monomeric and denatured collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to FN and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>, which showed a plateau at high substrate concentrations, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to fibrillar Col I reached a peak at intermediary concentrations and decreased thereafter, suggesting that cells respond to a definite macromolecular arrangement of collagenous fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Adhesion</z:e> to individual ECM molecules was not directly correlated with the apparent maturation state of the cells, nor with the relative density of known ECM receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that interaction of neoplastic B cells with selected matrix components may influence their dispersion throughout tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We further suggest that the use of quantitative cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> assays in vitro may provide means of defining the behavioral traits of neoplastic B cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
