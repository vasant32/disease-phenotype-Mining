<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe here two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with Mr values of 70,000 and 68,000 that interact with Grb2, phospholipase C (PLCgamma1 and PLCgamma2), and Vav after B cell receptor cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The interaction of pp70 and pp68 with PLC and Vav is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain of PLC and the SH2 domain of Vav </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the interaction of pp70 and pp68 with Grb2 requires cooperative binding of the SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis demonstrated that neither pp70 nor pp68 represented the recently described linker protein SLP-76, which binds Grb2, PLC, and Vav in T cells after T cell receptor activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, SLP-76 protein was not detected in a number of B cell lines or in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mouse B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence, we propose that pp70 and pp68 likely represent B cell homologs of SLP-76 which facilitate and coordinate B cell activation </plain></SENT>
