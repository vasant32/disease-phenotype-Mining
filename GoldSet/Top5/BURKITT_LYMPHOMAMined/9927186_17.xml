<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the cellular response to genotoxic stress, cell cycle checkpoint and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> are considered to be two of the major biological events in maintaining genomic stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor p53 has been shown to play critical roles in these stress-induced cellular responses at least in part through the activation of its down-stream genes, such as p21CIP1/WAF1, GADD45 and BAX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, p53 has been found to down-regulate the expression of BCL-2, which is able to block <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by both p53-dependent and independent signaling events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we have found that increased expression of Bcl-2 protein in the human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> WMN cell line suppressed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by different DNA-damaging agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The induction of p53-regulated genes including GADD45, p21CIP1/WAF1 and BAX by genotoxic stress was substantially reduced in cells expressing high levels of Bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Bcl-2 protein was shown to specifically suppress the p53-mediated transactivation of p21CIP1/WAF1 and PG13-CAT, which is a typical p53-binding-site reporter construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 protein was seen in a GADD45 promoter reporter construct after treatment with methylmethane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33543">sulfonate</z:chebi> or UV-radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that in addition to its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-suppressing activity, Bcl-2 protein is able to inhibit transactivation of p53-regulated genes, which function in multiple important cellular responses to genotoxic stress, including the control of cell cycle checkpoints, cell growth suppression and DNA repair </plain></SENT>
