<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A highly sensitive and specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was designed for detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related sequences in nucleic acid extracted by the conventional <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using this EBV-infected malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Raji cells, a comparative study of this assay was carried out with EBER1 (EBV-encoded small RNA1) primer and conventional DNA-PCR with BamHI-W and EBER1 primers, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that this assay has sensitivity about 10(5)-fold higher than the conventional DNA-PCR method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of EBER1 DNA and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was also investigated in 23 healthy individuals and 22 right and left tonsils of 11 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that this assay is both sensitive and specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> could be diagnosed easily determined and EBER1 was shown to be transcribed in peripheral blood cells and tonsils with quantitatively different grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This assay can be used to diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in clinical samples </plain></SENT>
