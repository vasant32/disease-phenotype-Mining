<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the frequency of supernumerary Ph, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, and del(9p21) by FISH and its relationship with the characteristics of the disease, in 46 BCR/ABL(+) adult BCP-ALL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of supernumerary Ph, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 and del(9p21) was 30%, 20%, 15%, and 24%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients displayed a BII/common phenotype, supernumerary Ph and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 were associated with higher expression of CD19 and CD22 and of CD19, CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR, respectively; in turn, cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 showed lower CD19, CD22, CD34, and cCD79a and del(9p21)(+) blasts were CD13(-) and CD33(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, similar clinical and hematological features were observed at presentation, independently of the underlying genetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) was significantly shorter in cases with supernumerary Ph, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, and del(9p21), the latter being the most powerful independent prognostic factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
