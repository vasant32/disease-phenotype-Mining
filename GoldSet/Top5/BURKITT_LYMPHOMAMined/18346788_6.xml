<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies have been proven to be efficient in the treatment of certain B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, these antibodies seem to exert diverse functions with narrow <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study is to investigate the molecular basis of the fine specificity of 2H7 derived antibodies which are of great therapeutic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that chimeric 2H7 (C2H7) can mediate complement dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity effects on CD20 positive human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and the Fab fragment can well recognize and bind to an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> of the extracellular loop of CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure of C2H7 in complex with the CD20 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was determined at 2.6A resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bound <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> displays a circular conformation and the binding specificity is mainly contributed by the (170)ANPS(173) motif and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bond of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> which maintains the unique conformation of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the complex structure of another anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab with the same <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> which was previously determined, the major differences lie in the CDR loop H3 of C2H7 which stretches outward against the interface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, the pocket which accommodates the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> becomes wider and the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> moves toward loop H3 and thus is more distant from loops H1 and H2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hydrogen-bonding interactions are also quite different from those observed in the Rituximab-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> complex, and both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions are less intense </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data not only reveal the molecular basis for the fine specificity of C2H7 to CD20, but also provide valuable information for further improvement of antibodies derived from 2H7 </plain></SENT>
