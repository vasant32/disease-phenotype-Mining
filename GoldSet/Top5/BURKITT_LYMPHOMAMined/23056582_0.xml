<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impaired degradation leading to the maintenance of Mcl-1 expression is an important determinant of drug resistance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation at Thr 163 in the PEST region, stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>)-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), is associated with Mcl-1 stabilization in BL41-3 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with the observation that Thr 163 phosphorylation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibroblasts primes <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase (GSK3)-induced phosphorylation at Ser 159, producing a phosphodegron that targets Mcl-1 for degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present follow-up studies in BL41-3 cells, Mcl-1 degradation was found to be independent of the GSK3-mediated pathway, providing a parallel to emerging findings showing that Mcl-1 degradation through this pathway is lost in many different types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Findings in Mcl-1-transfected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells corroborated those in BL41-3 cells in that the GSK3-targeted phosphodegron did not play a major role in Mcl-1 degradation, and a phosphomimetic T163E mutation resulted in marked Mcl-1 stabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-treated BL41-3 cells, in addition to exhibiting Thr 163 phosphorylation and Mcl-1 stabilization, exhibited an âˆ¼10-fold increase in resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents, including Ara-C, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, vinblastine, or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
