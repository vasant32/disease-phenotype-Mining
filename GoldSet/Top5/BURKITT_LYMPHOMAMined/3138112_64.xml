<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Daudi which carries the translocation t(8;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint of this translocation on the 14q+ chromosome occurs near to a rearranged DH-JH join, and the actual chromosome junction is a few hundred base pairs upstream of the joined DH element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide sequence of the rearranged DH segment shows that it does not come from the previously described D cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using this DH sequence as a probe we have identified two separate DH clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of these is the major DH cluster and is located only 20 kb upstream of the JH segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A pseudo-VH (probably the first VH segment) is also found approximately 98 kb from JH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A second, minor DH locus has been found which seems to be located on the distal side of the VH locus on chromosome 14, since there is little evidence for rearrangement or deletion of this locus in any B cell DNA analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A single VHIII subgroup gene is located within 25 kb of the newly identified DH element: it is possible that this minor locus occurs near the limit of the Igh locus </plain></SENT>
