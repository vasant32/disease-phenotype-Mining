<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is considered that BCL2 translocation precedes MYC events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> of DHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In fact, most cases of DHL arise de novo or following FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a very rare case of DHL arising from Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> according to the revised European-American classification of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 67-year-old Japanese male presented with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>[(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography revealed multiple abnormal accumulations in the bone marrow, pancreas, and periphery of the left kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was diagnosed with Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> according to a bone marrow biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the first relapse, chemotherapy was effective and the patient experienced sustained and complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the second relapse, however, the clinical presentation and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were nearly identical, but a high level of chemoresistance was acquired, and the patient succumbed almost 1 month after hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal analyses revealed a complex karyotype with concurrent t(14;18) and t(8;22) translocations, which have not been previously detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is therefore important to note that DHL cannot be diagnosed without chromosomal analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analyses should thus be performed for patients with high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and who experience a recurrence of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
