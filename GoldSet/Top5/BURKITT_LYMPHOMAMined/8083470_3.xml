<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the recent advances in knowledge of the molecular mechanism by which interleukin-4 (IL-4) induces IgE production, little is known about the signal transduction pathway that leads to this event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the signal transduction mechanism responsible for IL-4-induced expression of germ-line C epsilon transcripts with use of a human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B-cell line, DND39, which is known to express germ-line C epsilon transcripts in response to IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On stimulation with IL-4, the generation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> was observed in the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, this generation was associated with activation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although herbimycin A, a potent inhibitor of tryosine kinase, inhibited IL-4-induced activation of PLC-gamma 1 and generation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>, direct phosphorylation of <z:chebi fb="43" ids="53200">PCL</z:chebi>-gamma 1 was not determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, IL-4 stimulation could induce activation of FYN but not LYN kinase, suggesting that additional molecule(s) might link FYN kinase to PLC-gamma 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, herbimycin A almost completely inhibited IL-4-induced expression of germ-line C epsilon transcripts when present during the entire culture period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the induction of germ-line C epsilon transcripts in IL-4-stimulated DND39 cells is essentially dependent on the activation of tyrosine kinase, possibly FYN kinase </plain></SENT>
