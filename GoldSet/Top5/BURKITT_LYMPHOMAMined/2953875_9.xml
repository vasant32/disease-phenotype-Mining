<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nine cases of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and eight cases of small, noncleaved undifferentiated non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were stained with monoclonal antibodies, directed to the leukocyte common antigen (LCA), B- and T-cell markers as well as Calla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Small noncleaved, undifferentiated non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were LCA positive and expressed one or more B-cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three cases of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were LCA positive and showed reactivity with antibodies OKT4, OKT6 and OKT8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The six remaining cases of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were LCA negative, except for only one case that was weakly LCA positive using more sensitive detection methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the LCA negative cases expressed Calla, and four cases did not show any reactivity with the monoclonal antibodies used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> LCA negative cases, small residual non-neoplastic nodules representing remnants of lymphoid follicles, could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since five out of nine cases of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were LCA negative, lack of staining for LCA does not preclude the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
