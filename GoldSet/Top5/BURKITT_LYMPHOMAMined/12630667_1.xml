<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have observed EBV replication in lymphoblastoid cells after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> with B. garinii and B. afzelii strains after 1 and 4 h of their interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and borrelial antigens persisted in the lymphoblasts for 3 and 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphological and functional transformation of both agents facilitate their transfer to daughter cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Association with lymphoblasts and internalization of B. garinii by tube phagocytosis increased replication of viruses more successfully than B. afzelii and chemical inductors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demonstration of such findings must be interpreted cautiously, but may prove a mixed borrelial and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> cause of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
