<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The phosphotyrosine motifs at positions 74 or 85 and 112 within the LMP2A amino-terminal domain are essential for the LMP2A-mediated block of B-cell signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vivo studies indicate that LMP2A allows B-cell survival in the absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BCR signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A possible role for Akt in the LMP2A-mediated B-cell survival was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The protein kinase Akt is a crucial regulator of cell survival and is activated within B lymphocytes upon BCR cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LMP2A expression resulted in the constitutive phosphorylation of Akt, and this LMP2A effect is dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, recruitment of Syk and Lyn protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) to tyrosines 74 or 85 and 112, respectively, are critical for LMP2A-mediated Akt phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the ability of LMP2A to mediate a survival phenotype downstream of Akt could not be detected in EBV-negative Akata cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This would indicate that LMP2A is not responsible for EBV-dependent Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell survival </plain></SENT>
