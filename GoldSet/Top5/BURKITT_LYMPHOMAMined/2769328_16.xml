<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between January 1962 and November 1988, 395 children with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) were treated at St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Jude Children's Research Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven of these patients (2.8%) presented with a bone primary, usually in the femur (eight of 11 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age of these seven boys and four girls at presentation was 13 years (range, 5.5 to 19 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had one or more additional bones involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Working Formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The histologic subtypes included six large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, three lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, one small-noncleaved, non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and one unclassifiable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of multiagent chemotherapy combined with local radiation therapy in seven of 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six of 10 children who received chemotherapy as a component of their initial therapy, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> who presented with localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, are alive with no evidence of disease 2+ to 85+ months (median, 42.5 months) after cessation of treatment; one patient has just completed chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Each of the four patients who died showed leukemic conversion 5 to 11 months after diagnosis, and three died of progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> during chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> with no evidence of disease at necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that optimal therapy for PLB, as with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other forms of NHL, should focus on the histologic subtype and stage of disease </plain></SENT>
