<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells the c-myc gene locus is consistently fused to the constant region of one of the immunoglobulin genes by chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The translocated c-myc gene is transcriptionally activated and preferentially transcribed from the P1 promoter whenever the exon-intron structure of c-myc remains intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to define elements involved in this promoter shift we have cloned the translocated c-myc allele from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BL60, which is characterized by several point mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutated c-myc allele of BL60 was stably introduced into baby hamster kidney and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>S1 nuclease and RNAase protection mapping experiments demonstrated that the mutated c-myc allele was expressed at a low level and with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> promoter usage (P2 greater than P1) in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and baby hamster kidney cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have studied the expression of a construct consisting of the mutated c-myc allele, part of the bvr1 (Burkitt's variant rearranging region 1) locus, the human immunoglobulin kappa constant region, and the kappa intron enhancer after stable transfection into Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although c-myc expression was about fivefold increased, the transcripts still initiated predominantly at promoter P2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This indicates that 5 kb of the constant kappa light-chain locus including the kappa intron enhancer is not sufficient to induce the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-specific promoter shift </plain></SENT>
