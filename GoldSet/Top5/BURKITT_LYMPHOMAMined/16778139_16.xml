<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a humanized IgG4 form of the anti-HLA-DR mAb L243, hL243gamma4P (IMMU-114), generated to provide an agent with selectivity toward neoplastic cells that can kill without complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) or antibody-dependent cellular-cytotoxicity (ADCC), so as to reduce reliance on intact immunologic systems in the patient and effector mechanism-related toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies show that replacing the Fc region of hL243gamma1, a humanized IgG1 anti-HLA-DR mAb, with the IgG4 isotype abrogates the effector cell functions of the antibody (ADCC and CDC) while retaining its antigen-binding properties, antiproliferative capacity (in vitro and in vivo), and the ability to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> concurrent with activation of the AKT survival pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Growth inhibition was evaluated compared with and in combination with the anti-CD20 mAb rituximab, with the combination being more effective than rituximab alone in inhibiting proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, hL243gamma4P is indistinguishable from hL243gamma1 and the parental murine mAb in assays dependent on antigen recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The abrogation of ADCC and CDC, which are believed to play a major role in side effects of mAb therapy, may make this antibody an attractive clinical agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, combination of hL243gamma4P with rituximab offers the prospect for improved patient outcome </plain></SENT>
