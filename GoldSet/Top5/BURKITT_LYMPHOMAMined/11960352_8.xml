<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The execution phase of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> occurs through the activation and function of caspases which cleave key substrates that orchestrate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we have compared the sensitivity of various T and B cell lines to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, we found a lack of correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor expression and sensitivity to Fas or Trail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast, a correlation between caspase activation, DNA fragmentation and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in T cell lines was evidenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among T cells, CEM underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to CH11 but were resistant to Trail in agreement with the absence of Trail receptors (DR4 and DR5) on their surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The B cell line SKW 6.4 was sensitive to CH11 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi> but resistant to Trail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As B cell lines expressed significant levels of DR4 and DR5, resistance to Trail in SKW 6.4 is likely due to the expression of the decoy receptor DcR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> such as RPMI 8866 and Raji did not exhibit DNA fragmentation in response to CH11, Trail or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi> but showed long-term caspase-dependent loss of viability upon effector treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The B cell lines used in this study express very weak or undetectable levels of DFF40 and relatively high levels of DFF45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, cytosolic extracts from RPMI 88.66 but not other B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> exhibit altered levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>-dependent caspase activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results show that: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor expression does not correlate with sensitivity to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>; (2) the very low ratio of DFF40 vs. DFF45 is unlikely to explain by itself the lack of DNA fragmentation observed in certain B cell lines; and (3) a defective <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>-dependent caspase activation might account at least in part for the insensitivity of certain Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (RPMI 88.66) to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus it seems that resistance of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is not governed by a general mechanism, but is rather multifactorial and differs from one cell line to another </plain></SENT>
