<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> and DMSO led to changes in phenotype which suggested the cells were being activated, whilst the conditioned media resulted in increased immunoglobulin secretion, accompanied by phenotypic changes more consistent with maturation towards the plasma cell stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The four cell lines, which had different origins (EBV-transformed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, prolymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>) responded differently to the culture stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These differences suggest that the changes associated with transformation affect the way in which these cells respond to agents which stimulate activation and maturation </plain></SENT>
