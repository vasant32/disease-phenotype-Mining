<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>While Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is associated with the development of certain lymphoid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205853" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">epithelial tumors</z:e>, the role of the virus in the pathogenesis of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that EBV strain variation may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two major strains of EBV, type 1 and type 2, have been identified on the basis of genetic polymorphisms and other minor genetic variations give rise to distinct EBV isolates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed EBV strain variation in healthy individuals and compared them with EBV isolates present in lymphoid and epithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> from the same geographic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, the incidence of the 30-bp latent membrane protein (LMP1) gene deletion, recently implicated in the development of more aggressive forms of virus-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>], was examined in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While a preferential association of the LMP1 deletion with the type 2 strain of EBV was observed, there was no increased incidence of virus isolates carrying this deletion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or virus-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> compared with the appropriate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A polymorphism in the BamHI F region of the EBV genome, previously identified in Chinese populations, was found at increased incidence in European <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, we found that most of the EBV gene polymorphisms detected in EBV isolates from healthy virus carriers occurred with similar frequency in virus-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from the same geographical region </plain></SENT>
