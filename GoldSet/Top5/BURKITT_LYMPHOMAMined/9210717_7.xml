<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors attempted to determine the frequency of the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using a nonisotopic in situ hybridization technique to detect the presence of EBV-encoded small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (EBERs) in paraffin embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissues of other types of B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining was performed to examine the presence of an EBV-encoded protein, latent membrane protein (LMP), and p53 in specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EBERs were detectable in 10 of 18 BL specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was present in the cervical lymph nodes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e>) in six of the seven cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007873" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical tumors</z:e>, in the maxillary region in one case, in one of two cases of axillary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e>, and in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">abdominal tumors</z:e> in two of the seven cases of intraabdominal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBER positive cells were diffusely present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> except in one abdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, in which only a few EBER positive cells were scattered in a small part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EBER positive cells were not detected in the case with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in an inguinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> and in the seven cases with intraabdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies showed that LMP and p53 were expressed in 3 and 4 of the 18 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In another 20 NHLs in peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e>, EBERs were detectable in only 1 case of diffuse large cell histology with numerous reactive T cells in which only large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells expressed EBERs and LMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EBERs were not detected in any of the ten cases of extranodal NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Taiwan, EBV is frequently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> occurring outside the abdomen but rarely with intraabdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall association between EBV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in Taiwan is intermediate compared with other regions of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results support the theory that the frequency of EBV associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> is influenced by the endemicity of EBV and/or the socioeconomic status of a country </plain></SENT>
