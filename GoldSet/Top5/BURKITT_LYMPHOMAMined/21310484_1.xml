<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effects induced by 7-b and the molecular mechanisms involved remain poorly understood in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To shed light on these issues, we have investigated the effects of 7-b on proliferation, cell cycle progression, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> activity and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that 7-b inhibited the proliferation of Raji cells and induced G1 cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 7-b treatment triggered programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alteration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential (Δψm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Altogether our results showed that 7-b mediated its growth inhibitory effects on Raji cells via the activation of a ROS-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> pathway and cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathway which subsequently targeted p21 </plain></SENT>
