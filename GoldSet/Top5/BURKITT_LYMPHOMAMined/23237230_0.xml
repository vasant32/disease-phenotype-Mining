<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years, TLS has been more widely observed, due at least in part to the availability of more effective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, TLS is seen with greater frequency in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, and particularly in bulky <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with organ or bone marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The consequences of TLS include the serious morbidity and high risk of mortality associated with the condition itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, TLS may delay or force an alteration in the patient's chemotherapy regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changing patterns of TLS, as well as its frequency, in the clinical setting, result in unnecessarily high rates of illness and/or fatality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic measures are widely available for patients at risk of TLS, and are considered highly effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present article discusses the various manifestations of TLS, its risk factors and management options to prevent TLS from occurring </plain></SENT>
