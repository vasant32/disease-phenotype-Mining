<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we present a simpler, yet accurate, method to assess and quantitate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> that utilizes these markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From the sequence of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and T cell receptor (TcR) gene rearrangements characterized at the time of diagnosis or relapse, primers were designed and tested in a clone-specific, single-round PCR assay, then analyzed by fluorescence staining of the PCR products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most critical step involved an adherence to a new set of guidelines for the design of clone-specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Application of this method to 54 IgH and 13 TcR (nine Vdelta2Ddelta3 and four Ddelta2-Ddelta3) gene rearrangements in 47 patients resulted in an intense band within the region of the predicted molecular weight, confirming the reproducibility of the assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative applications of the approach were examined by performing a 10-replicate limiting dilution clone-specific PCR on six diagnostic samples and an asymptotic response model of the Von Krogh form was found to fit the data well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From this model, estimation of leukemic cells of remission bone marrow samples was achieved at a detection sensitivity of 2 x 10(-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The method is demonstrated on 18 patients whose marrows were prospectively analyzed during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude this methodology is useful in the quick and accurate assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e>, and could be applied to other DNA quantitation assays </plain></SENT>
