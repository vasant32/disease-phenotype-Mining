<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histogenetic studies have suggested that PEL originates from B cells at a late stage of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated PEL for the expression status of MUM1/IRF4 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> 1/interferon regulatory factor 4) protein, which is involved in physiological B-cell maturation and represents a histogenetic marker of late B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using multiple detection assays, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of PEL (n = 22) were found to express MUM1/IRF4 molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MUM1/IRF4 expression was a selective feature of PEL among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> involving the serous body cavities as secondary lymphomatous effusions generally failed to express the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In reactive lymphoid tissues, MUM1/ IRF4 expression clustered with advanced stages of B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of MUM1/IRF4 expression with that of other histogenetic markers defined two phenotypic variants of PEL, i.e. MUM1/IRF4+, CD138/syndecan-1+, B-cell antigen- (20 out of 22 cases) and MUM1/IRF4+, CD138/syndecan-1-, B-cell antigen+ (2 out of 22 cases), suggesting a certain degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the disease histogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The implications of these data are threefold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>First, MUM1/IRF4 expression corroborates the notion that PEL originates from post-germinal centre, preterminally differentiated B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Second, MUM1/IRF4 may help in the differential diagnosis of PEL among other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> involving the serous body cavities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, MUM1/IRF4 may interact with HHV-8/KSHV-encoded interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and thus contribute to PEL escape from interferon-mediated control of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
