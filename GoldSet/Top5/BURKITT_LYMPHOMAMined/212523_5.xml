<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibody titers to EBNA, EA, and VCA were determined in more than 25 sera of patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC), or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A good correlation between the titers of these antigens was obtained by the immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The indirect (anti-IgG) immunoperoxidase technique for the detection of EBNA is, in contrast to the indirect immunofluorescence method, highly sensitive </plain></SENT>
