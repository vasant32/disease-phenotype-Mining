<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty additional cases were tested only for TdT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TdT was positive in 10 out of 13 lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (LL) examined and negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other specimens, including the ten cases of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> above 350 U/mg of protein were found in 10 out of 12 LL tested, but not in any other specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3 TdT- LL had high contents of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> LL can be detected using both <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> and TdT markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3 TdT- LL had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> phenotype and their possible origin is discussed in view of the possibility that they constitute a rare entity distinct from the more common TdT+ LL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Very low levels of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> (below 100 U/mg of protein) were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e>, and in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In other B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, intermediate values between 100 and 350 U were often found, and this finding could be relevant to the different cellular origin of the various B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> distribution is solid <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp> reflects the cellular origin of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase alone and in combination with TdT can be useful in the diagnosis and classification of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in which the immature hystotypes predominate </plain></SENT>
