<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent cytotoxic T-cell clones were obtained by limiting dilution from a lymphocyte culture stimulated in vitro with the autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) in the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both clones uniformly had a T3+, T4+, Dr+ phenotype and lysed autologous B blasts, the autologous LCL, and allogeneic B cell lines sharing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic function was triggered by FCS-derived components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no killing if the sensitive targets were cultured in serum-free medium or in medium supplemented with human serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity to lysis could be restored by exposing the targets to FCS for at least 6 hr at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies directed to T-cell-specific surface antigens and MHC class II antigens inhibited lysis with different efficiencies depending on the target cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Killing of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>)-derived cell lines was blocked more easily than killing of LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LCLs but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines induced proliferation of the T-cell clones in the absence of exogenous IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differences were not related to quantitative variations in the expression of MHC class II antigens, indicating that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines differ from LCLs in other cell membrane properties that may influence antigen presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the affinity of effector/target binding, which is probably influenced by the concentration of antigenic determinants expressed on the target cell membrane, determines whether proliferative responses or cytotoxicity are induced in the antigen-recognizing T cells </plain></SENT>
