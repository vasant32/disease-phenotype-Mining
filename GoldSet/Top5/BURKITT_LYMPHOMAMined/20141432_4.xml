<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The discovery that some selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> transporter- (SSRI) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> transporter- (NSRI) targeting antidepressants have the potential to act as anticancer agents adds greatly to their diverse pharmacological application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report that the SSRI <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> and the NSRI maprotiline are potent antiproliferative agents against human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), having little effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of this study show that although there is low-level expression of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> transporter (NET) in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, NET is not involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi>- or maprotiline-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, as neither <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> nor other NET inhibitors prevented this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of other NET ligands investigated for activity, only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47781">desipramine</z:chebi> was found to have a similar effect to maprotiline and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi>, suggesting the existence of a common selective structural modality for cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and aiding in the future development of more potent analogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we also show evidence to support previous reports that the <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> transporter (SERT) has no involvement in antidepressant-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, as SERT-specific ligands were unable to prevent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> or maprotiline cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SERT ligands could induce cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although no target has yet been identified for the action of these compounds, the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> elicited is potent, selective, and worthy of future investigation </plain></SENT>
