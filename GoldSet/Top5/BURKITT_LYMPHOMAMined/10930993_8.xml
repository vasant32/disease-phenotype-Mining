<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the clinical significance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-regulating factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL), we investigated cell samples of children with ALL who had been included in the German ALL Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster (BFM) study using flow cytometry for constitutive expression levels of CD95 (n = 110) and Bcl-2 (n = 110) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we determined the extent of spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in vitro (n = 102) and susceptibility to anti-CD95-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (CD95-sensitivity) (n = 97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We correlated these findings with the functional activity of the multidrug resistance (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>)-associated P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (P-gp), as detected by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">rhodamine123</z:chebi> efflux test, immunophenotype, cytogenetics and clinical data of the patients examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Good responders to initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> therapy ('<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> response') revealed significantly higher Bcl-2 expression levels [5.4 +/- 3.4 relative fluorescence intensity (RFI), n = 68] than poor responders (3.7 +/- 2.6 RFI, n = 42; P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between the other investigated parameters and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, neither the CD95 and Bcl-2 expression levels nor the extent of spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in vitro, CD95 sensitivity or P-gp function were correlated with the response to induction chemotherapy or relapse rate, either for B-cell precursor ALL or T-cell ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No consistent pattern of change in CD95 (n = 10) and Bcl-2 expression (n = 9) was noted in cases studied at both initial diagnosis and relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings underline the different cell biological features of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and ALL cells </plain></SENT>
