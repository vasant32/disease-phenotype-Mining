<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The hospital records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients aged 15 years or younger, who presented at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (a tertiary referral center) with a histologically confirmed orofacial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> over a 13-year period were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One-fifth of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> orofacial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> during the study period occurred in the pediatric age-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The male-female ratio was 1.4 to 1 and 11- to 15-year-olds were most frequently affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086692" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Benign tumors</z:e> (59.8%) were more prevalent than <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> (40.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 18.4% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were of odontogenic origin, 42.5% were benign nonodontogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and 39.1% were malignant nonodontogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The anterior part of the mandible was frequently involved by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_381'>ameloblastoma</z:mpath>, which was the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0100612'>odontogenic tumor</z:hpo> (6.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the benign nonodontogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were of mesenchymal origin (46%), and most were located in soft tissues (59.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (22.4%) was the most common malignant nonodontogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The observed differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type and distribution in this study compared with previous studies may be attributable to genetic and geographic differences in the populations studied </plain></SENT>
