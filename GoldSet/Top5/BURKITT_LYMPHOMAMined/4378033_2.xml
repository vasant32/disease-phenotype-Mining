<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Radiation is curative in many types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0796563,C1334407" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">localized cancer</z:e>, whereas chemotherapy is rarely curative in either localized or widespread <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this reason, chemotherapy should never be employed in any situation where it might hinder or prevent the administration of a potentially curative dose of radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumor</z:e> in Africa, where a multicentric origin seems to be much more probable, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, 40 mg/kg intravenously repeated every 3 to 4 weeks, has occasionally been curative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e>, surgery, radiation and chemotherapy are essential for optimal results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, chemotherapy with the conventional agents, as well as newer drugs such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> and L-asparaginase, is the treatment of choice, with radiation being useful mainly in treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> in the bones or in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The great interest in L-asparaginase at the present time lies in the fact that certain neoplastic cells have a specific nutritional requirement for the amino acid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17196">L-asparagine</z:chebi>, whereas no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells appear to have this requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In many cases of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic disease</z:e>, the partnership of radiation therapy to reduce large bulky lesions composed to a large extent of nonproliferating cells, followed by chemotherapy to destroy the few surviving and now perhaps proliferating cells remaining in the original mass or in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, would seem to offer the greatest promise of theoretical and practical benefit </plain></SENT>
