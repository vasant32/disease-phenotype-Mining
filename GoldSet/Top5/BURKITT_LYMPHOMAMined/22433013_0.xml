<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The migratory nature of dendritic cells is subverted by HIV-1 to gain access to lymph nodes where <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dendritic cells express several calcium-dependent C-type lectin receptors including dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), which constitute a major receptor for HIV-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DC-SIGN recognizes N-linked high-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> glycan clusters on HIV gp120 through multivalent and Ca(2+)-dependent protein-carbohydrate interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mimicking the cluster presentation of oligomannosides from the virus surface is a strategic approach for carbohydrate-based <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33281">microbicides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50825">gold nanoparticles</z:chebi> (mannoGNPs) displaying multiple copies of structural motifs (di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, or heptaoligomanosides) of the N-linked high-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> glycan of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gp120 are efficient inhibitors of DC-SIGN-mediated trans-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of human T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have now prepared the corresponding fluorescent-labeled glyconanoparticles (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-mannoGNPs) and studied their uptake by DC-SIGN expressing Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (Raji DC-SIGN cell line) and monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells (iDCs) by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the 1.8 nm oligomannoside coated nanoparticles are endocytosed following both DC-SIGN-dependent and -independent pathways and part of them colocalize with DC-SIGN in early endosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The blocking and sequestration of DC-SIGN receptors by mannoGNPs could explain their ability to inhibit HIV-1 trans-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of human T cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
