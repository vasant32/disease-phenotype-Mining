<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> are presented to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, and it is reasonable to expect that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> would be good substrates for the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), as TAP plays a major role in the transport of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for binding to MHC class I molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we have previously shown that several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi>, such as those derived from tyrosinase, gp100, MAGE-1 and MAGE-2 antigens, are in fact poor substrates for TAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the process of determining why these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> were capable of eliciting a strong CTL response, yet were poor substrates for TAP, it was observed that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> possessed amino acids at their N-terminus that were deleterious for TAP binding as described for the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-binding motif for human TAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore postulated that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> were transported by TAP as longer precursor molecules, and then trimmed in the ER to the appropriate size for presentation to T-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an effort to test this hypothesis we synthesized a set of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, derived from the tyrosinase (YMNGTMSQV) and MAGE-1 (EADPTGHSY) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi>, which possess N-terminal extensions of up to four amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show here that the longer <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> are indeed transported into the ER at a significantly higher level than the original <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that the longer <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>-associated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> are the preferred substrates for TAP, and further support the notion that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> can be trimmed at the N-terminus in the ER during antigen processing </plain></SENT>
