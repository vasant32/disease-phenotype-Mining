<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While inhibitors of herpesvirus DNA polymerases, like <z:chebi fb="1" ids="465284">gancyclovir</z:chebi>, reduce EBV lytic cycle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, these treatments have limited efficacy for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBNA1 is an EBV-encoded DNA-binding protein required for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome maintenance during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Here, we report the identification of a new class of small molecules that inhibit EBNA1 DNA binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These compounds were identified by virtual screening of 90,000 low molecular mass compounds using computational docking programs with the solved crystal structure of EBNA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four structurally related compounds were found to inhibit EBNA1-DNA binding in biochemical assays with purified EBNA1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compounds had a range of 20-100 microM inhibition of EBNA1 in fluorescence polarization assays and were further validated for inhibition using electrophoresis mobility shift assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These compounds exhibited no significant inhibition of an unrelated DNA binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of these compounds inhibited EBNA1 transcription activation function in cell-based assays and reduced EBV genome copy number when incubated with a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These experiments provide a proof-of-principle that virtual screening can be used to identify specific inhibitors of EBNA1 that may have potential for treatment of EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
