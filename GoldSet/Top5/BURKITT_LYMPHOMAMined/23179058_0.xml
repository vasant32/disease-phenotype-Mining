<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deregulation of Myc via gene amplification, chromosomal translocation or other mechanisms lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> including Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, and many other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The oncogene myc is a highly potent transforming gene and capable to transform various cell types in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its oncogenic activity initialized by deregulated expression leads to a shift of the equilibrium in the Myc/Max/Mad network towards Myc/Max complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Myc/Max heterodimerization is a prerequisite for transcriptional functionality of Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primarily, we are focusing on the apo-state of the C-terminal domain of v-Myc, the retroviral homolog of human c-Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on multi-dimensional NMR measurements v-Myc appears to be neither a fully structured nor a completely unstructured protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The bHLHZip domain of v-Myc does not exist as a random coil but exhibits partially pre-formed Î±-helical regions in its apo-state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate the structural propensities of Myc in more detail, the backbone and side-chain assignments obtained here for apo-Myc are a crucial prerequisite for further NMR measurements </plain></SENT>
