<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary infection</z:e>, EBV persists in an asymptomatic latent state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, it may switch to lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Latent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> has been associated with several diseases, such as Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To date, there are no available drugs to target latent EBV and the existing broad spectrum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36044">antiviral drugs</z:chebi> are mainly active against lytic <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, using computational molecular docking, a virtual screen of a library of small molecules, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37647">xanthones</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoids</z:chebi> (described with potential for antiviral activity against EBV), was carried out targeting EBV proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The more interesting molecules were selected for further computational analysis and subsequently the compounds were tested in the Raji (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell line, to evaluate their activity against latent EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present work identified three novel sulfated small molecules capable of decreasing EBV levels in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the in silico screening presents a good approach for the development of new anti-EBV agents. Â© 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S </plain></SENT>
