<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human lymphoid cells (Raji) were exposed to water-soluble compounds from cigarette smoke (CS) generated in a smoking machine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA damage, as detected by alkaline single-cell microelectrophoresis (COMET assay), was induced in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the rapidly induced DNA damage was attributable to direct-acting compounds since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi>-related metabolic activities (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="42241">ethoxy</z:chebi>- and pentoxyresorufin-O-deethylases and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi>-7-hydroxylase) were absent or very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, induction of DNA damage could be inhibited only slightly by beta-naphthoflavone and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">Vitamin C</z:chebi> enhanced DNA damage in Raji cells probably by redox cycling of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18135">catechol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> present in CS implicating reactive oxygen intermediates as another source of DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi>, a radical scavenger and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> precursor, reduced DNA damage in Raji cells when exposure to CS was followed by 2 h post-incubation in culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unrepaired DNA damage caused by CS persisted longer than gamma-irradiation-induced DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the CS constituents, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi>, but not <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15343,43923">acetaldehyde</z:chebi>, induced DNA damage although less intensely than CS itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 50 and 100 microM concentrations, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> also inhibited repair of gamma- irradiation-induced DNA damage in the COMET assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of DNA synthesis by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> at 50 microM was demonstrated by an immunochemical assay for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-deoxyuridine incorporation; however, inhibition of a representative repair enzyme, 8-oxoguanosine hydrolase, by either CS or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present results further confirm the presence of direct-acting genotoxic components and inhibitors of DNA repair in the gas phase of tobacco smoke, that may contribute to DNA damage and smoking-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> of the upper aerodigestive tract </plain></SENT>
