<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genes in cis and trans can share the same factory, suggesting that genes migrate to preassembled transcription sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used fluorescent in situ hybridization to investigate the dynamics of gene association with transcription factories during immediate early (IE) gene induction in mouse B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that induction involves rapid gene relocation to transcription factories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we find that the Myc proto-oncogene on Chromosome 15 is preferentially recruited to the same transcription factory as the highly transcribed Igh gene located on Chromosome 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myc and Igh are the most frequent translocation partners in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results show that transcriptional activation of IE genes involves rapid relocation to preassembled transcription factories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the data imply a direct link between the nonrandom interchromosomal organization of transcribed genes at transcription factories and the incidence of specific chromosomal translocations </plain></SENT>
