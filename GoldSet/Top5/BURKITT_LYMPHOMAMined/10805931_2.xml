<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has been difficult to visualize and identify dynamic intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> between migrating cells in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two fluorescent membrane dyes, PKH2 and PKH26 for staining HT1080 and hematopoietic cells and cell lines, and an automated fluorescence microscopy system were used to monitor intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cellular extensions connecting two or more adjacent cells were visualized, showing the intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> between migrating cells for minutes and up to hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After cells adhered to each other, followed by cell migration in different directions, cellular extensions were dragged from the pivotal contact points in different focal planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD34(+)-enriched mobilized peripheral blood cells and six hematopoietic cell lines showed intercellular connections in cocultures with HT1080 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency of intercellular connections was variable in different cocultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cell density of about 3.1 x 10(4) cells/cm(2) for both cell lines in cocultures provided an adequate number of cells in each field of view, showing up to four intercellular connections per 100 total cells plated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The tools derived from this study will open new areas of investigation for understanding the mechanism of the intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> process </plain></SENT>
