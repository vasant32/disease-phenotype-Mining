<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> serum concentrations following administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> suspension via orogastric feeding tubes to 2 critically ill allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARIES: A 38-year-old man and a 29-year-old man, each allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients, were treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> for documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intubation and mechanical ventilation impeded ingestion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> capsules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">Itraconazole</z:chebi> was prepared initially as a suspension in intravenous <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> emulsion 20% and later as a suspension in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="30769">citric acid</z:chebi> 1.5% in D5W USP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">Itraconazole</z:chebi> serum concentrations were assayed using HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> serum concentrations were undetectable to 72 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postdose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> serum concentrations were 5-97 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">Itraconazole</z:chebi> concentrations measured in these patients were markedly lower than serum concentrations reported in the literature for similar doses administered to fed subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Efficacy of this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35718">antifungal agent</z:chebi> is limited currently by the patient's ability to ingest and absorb the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> capsules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pathophysiologic factors and suspension formulation issues that likely contributed to decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> absorption are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preparation and administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> as a suspension did not enhance drug absorption in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> suspension may be affected by physical compatibility and chemical stability of the extemporaneous preparations </plain></SENT>
