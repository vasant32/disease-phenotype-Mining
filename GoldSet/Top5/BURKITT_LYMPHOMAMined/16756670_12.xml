<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), and can transform human B cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV-harboring cell lines are widely used to investigate lymphocyte transformation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Qualitative EBV gene expression has been extensively described, but knowledge of quantitative transcription is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that transcription levels of EBNA1, the gene essential for EBV persistence within an infected cell, are similar in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: To compare quantitative gene transcription in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines Namalwa, Raji, Akata, Jijoye, and P3HR1, we developed an oligonucleotide microarray chip, including 17 housekeeping genes, six latent EBV genes (EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3C, LMP1, LMP2), and four lytic EBV genes (BZLF1, BXLF2, BKRF2, BZLF2), and used the cell line B95.8 as a reference for EBV gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to validate microarray results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that transcription levels of housekeeping genes differed considerably among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a selection of housekeeping genes with similar quantitative transcription in the tested cell lines to normalize EBV gene transcription data, we showed that transcription levels of EBNA1 were quite similar in very different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines, in contrast to transcription levels of other EBV genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As demonstrated with Akata cells, the chip allowed us to accurately measure EBV gene transcription changes triggered by treatment interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest uniform EBNA1 transcription levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and that microarray profiling can reveal novel insights on quantitative EBV gene transcription and its impact on lymphocyte biology </plain></SENT>
