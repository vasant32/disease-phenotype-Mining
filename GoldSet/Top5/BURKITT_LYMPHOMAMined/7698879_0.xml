<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of these molecules on the cell surface does not affect subsequent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) binding but it prevents <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> is enhanced if Raji cells were incubated with heat-inactivated serum whose C3 fragments may bind only through receptor-binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the region on cell surface offering the covalent site to C3 fragments would be essential for EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incubation of Raji cells for 1 min with EBV results in the phosphorylation of CR2 and of a high-molecular-weight protein followed by their dephosphorylation, completed already after 20 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding ascribes to EBV a prompt action through its receptor, different from that of other compounds causing a prolonged CR2 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that at least two binding sites are required for EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> of Raji cells or that specific patterns of CR2 phosphorylation may modulate Raji <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> by EBV </plain></SENT>
