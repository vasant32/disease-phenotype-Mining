<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main silver-stained band visualized after <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>/PAGE corresponded to an autophosphorylated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> of about 350-kDa that represents the catalytic component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The existence of Ku DNA-binding protein as a regulatory component in the purified enzyme was revealed by Western blot/enzyme immunoassay and direct inhibition test with anti-Ku sera from the autoimmune patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DNA-PK catalyzed phosphorylation of synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> corresponding to Myc and RB proteins in a DNA-dependent manner, indicating that DNA-PK may recognize a second core-sequence motif Pro-Ser/<z:chebi fb="32" ids="30013">Thr-</z:chebi> in addition to the putative consensus sequences of -Ser/Thr<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30011">-Gln </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of enzyme activity was significantly higher in DMSO-induced G0/G1-arrested Raji cells as well as in the cells after release from DMSO than in the log-phase cells </plain></SENT>
