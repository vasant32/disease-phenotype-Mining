<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relationships between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23743">dihydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (DHFR) levels or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> membrane transport and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) immunophenotype were evaluated on 51 T-cell and 44 B-precursor ALL specimens from 90 pediatric ALL patients at diagnosis and relapse, using a fluorescent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> analog (PT430) and flow cytometry assay (Matherly et al, Blood 85:500, 1995) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For T-cell ALL, 35 of 45 (78%) of newly diagnosed patients' specimens exhibited elevated DHFR relative to DHFR levels in ALL blasts from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>-responsive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For 30 of 45 diagnostic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> specimens, DHFR expression was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, with up to 3 separate subpopulations covering a 44-fold range; the DHFR-overproducing fractions comprised 10% to 88% of the total blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elevated DHFR was less common in B-precursor ALL at diagnosis, being detected in only 17 of 36 specimens (47%); 11 of these samples exhibited DHFR <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median maximal DHFR levels were fourfold higher in T-cell than B-precursor ALL at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within a particular phenotypic group, there were no correlations between DHFR levels and patient prognostic features, including age, sex, chromosomal abnormalities, white blood cell counts (WBCs), and percentage of S-phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, for B-precursor ALL, there was a notably higher fraction of African-American than white patients with elevated DHFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients (both phenotypes) with low WBCs (&lt;50,000/ microL), event-free survival times were significantly shorter for those expressing DHFR above a threshold level than for patients expressing DHFR below this level (P &lt; .016); this relationship was not seen for patients with high WBCs (&gt;50,000/microL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated DHFR was detected in 11 of 14 relapse specimens (5 of 6 T-cell and 6 of 8 B-precursor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of five paired relapse specimens (both T-cell) from patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> exhibited increased DHFR levels over those at diagnosis (2.5- to 5-fold); the fraction of DHFR-overproducing blasts was also increased in 4 of 5 paired relapse specimens (2 B-precursor and 2 T-cell) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the variations in DHFR, highly impaired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> transport was detected in only 6 of 95 ALL specimens, including both diagnosis and relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between phenotype and impaired transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data provide further rationale for the use of mechanistically based prognostic factors to complement known biologic or disease-based prognostic indicators in the design of ALL therapy including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, particularly with patients presenting with low WBCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The finding of a markedly increased frequency of DHFR overexpression in T-cell over B-precursor ALL suggests that this difference is associated with the poorer prognosis of patients with T-cell ALL treated with standard-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolite</z:chebi> therapy and implies that higher-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (&gt; or = 1 g/m2) during consolidation therapy may be useful in the treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
