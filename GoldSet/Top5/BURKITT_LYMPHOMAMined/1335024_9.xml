<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relative levels, rates of synthesis and stabilities of the abundant Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, EBER-1 and EBER-2, were examined in Daudi Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although both <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> are transcribed at approximately equal rates, the steady-state level of EBER-1 is at least 10-fold greater than that of EBER-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is shown to be due to a much faster rate of turnover of EBER-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi>, the half-lives of EBER-1 and EBER-2 are 8 to 9 h and 0.75 h, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following treatment of the cells with human interferon (IFN) alpha the transcription of both <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> is strongly inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the level of EBER-1 increases up to twofold, indicating a further stabilization of this <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In IFN-treated cells, EBER-2 accumulates in the form of truncated products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nuclease protection experiments indicated that this is due to a post-transcriptional modification of the 3' end of the molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data show that the effects of IFN treatment on the expression of these two <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene products are very complex in cells latently infected with EBV </plain></SENT>
