<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, these effects were also studied using 1 of the 8 OPP in 2 human lymphoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In V79 cells, 6 of the 8 OPP induced significant increase of frequencies of SCE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the OPP induced various degrees of cell cycle delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 6 OPP in decreasing order of SCE induction are <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38746">methylparathion</z:chebi>, demeton, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6908">trichlorfon</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="34714">dimethoate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="6651">malathion</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34837">methidathion</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 2 OPP that had no effect on SCE are diazion and disyston </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extents of induced cell cycle delay are generally related to the OPP concentrations but does not necessarily correlate with the extent of induction of SCE among the OPP studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of studies on the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38746">methyl-parathion</z:chebi> on SCE and cell cycle delay in 2 human cell lines showed that both lines had significant and dose-dependent increase of SCE frequencies similar to those observed in V79 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to V79 cells, however, cell cycle delay was not as prominent in the human lines at comparable doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies indicated that 5-bromodeoxyuridine labeling for analyzing SCE and cell cycle delay is a very sensitive method in assessing mutagenic potential of environmental compounds especially those that are highly toxic to and rapidly degradable in mammalian cells such as OPP </plain></SENT>
