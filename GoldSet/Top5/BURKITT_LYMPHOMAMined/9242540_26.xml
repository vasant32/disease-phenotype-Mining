<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms causing the marked loss of CD4+ T lymphocytes are incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, several lines of evidence indicate that direct cytopathology mediated by HIV-1 is a key element in such CD4+ T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether the previously reported incorporation of host-derived major histocompatibility class II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> (MHC-II) on HIV-1 can alter its replicative capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To achieve this goal, virus stocks were produced in parental MHC-II-expressing RAJI cells and in MHC-II-negative RAJI mutants (RM3), both of which have been stably transfected with human CD4 cDNA to allow productive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with HIV-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An enhancement of the rate/efficiency of virus entry was seen after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with normalized amounts of virions carrying host-derived MHC-II on their surface as compared with inoculation with virions devoid of cellular MHC-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data from time-course and infectivity experiments showed that the kinetics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were more rapid for virions bearing host-derived MHC-II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> than for MHC-II-free HIV-1 particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that virally embedded cellular MHC-II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> are functional and can have a positive effect on early events in the virus replicative cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we show that the acquisition of cellular MHC-II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> by HIV-1 can modify its biologic properties and might, consequently, influence the pathogenesis of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retroviral disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
