<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These B-cell clones were representative of the respective neoplastic parental clones, as determined by immunophenotypic and molecular genetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IgM MoAbs were highly specific for the i determinant on red blood cells (cold agglutinins), but bound none of the other eight self and nine foreign antigens (Ags) tested, including those most commonly recognized by natural antibodies or autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Structural analysis showed that the IgM MoAb VH segment sequences were 93.5% and 84.2% identical with that of the germline VH4-21 gene, which encodes the vast majority of cold agglutinins that are specific for the i/l carbohydrate Ag and are produced under <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphoproliferative conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-2 MoAb VH4-21 gene segment was juxtaposed with 20P3 and JH6 genes and paired with a V lambda 1 segment, the sequence of which was 95.5% identical to that of the germline Humlv117 gene; the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-3 MoAb VH4-21 gene segment was juxtaposed with DXP'1 and JH5 genes and paired with a V lambda 1 segment, the sequence of which was 86.7% identical to that of the germline Humlv1L1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high degree of conservation of the VH4-21 gene in the human population, the nature of the nucleotide differences in the expressed VH4-21 segments, and the presence of nucleotide substitutions in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-2 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-3 IgM MoAb JH and/or J lambda segments suggested that the MoAb V segments underwent a process of somatic hypermutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was formally shown in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-3 MoAb VH segment, by differentially targeted polymerase chain reaction amplification of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-3 MoAb-producing cell genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, cloning and sequencing of the genomic DNA from fibroblasts of the same patient whose neoplastic B cells gave rise to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-3 cell line yielded a germline copy of the VH4-21 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the expression of VH4-21 gene products may be involved in a self Ag-driven process of clonal B-cell expansion and selection associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
