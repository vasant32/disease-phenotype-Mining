<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) is a clinically and genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A small subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> has translocations involving the MYC locus and an additional group has a molecular signature resembling Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (mBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presently, identification of such cases by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> is unreliable and relies on cytogenetic or complex molecular methods such as gene transcriptional profiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Herein, we describe an immunohistochemical (IHC) method for identifying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> with increased MYC protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tested 77 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and identified 15 cases with high MYC protein expression (nuclear staining in &gt;50% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> MYC translocation positive cases had increased MYC protein expression by this IHC assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> transcriptional profiles revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with increased MYC protein expression (regardless of underlying MYC translocation status) had coordinate upregulation of MYC target genes, providing molecular confirmation of the IHC results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We then generated a molecular classifier derived from the MYC IHC results in our cases and employed it to successfully classify mBLs from two previously reported independent case series, providing additional confirmation that the MYC IHC results identify clinically important subsets of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lastly, we found that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> with high MYC protein expression had inferior overall survival when treated with R-CHOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the IHC method described herein can be used to readily identify the biologically and clinically distinct cases of MYC-driven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, which represent a clinically significant subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cases due to their inferior overall survival </plain></SENT>
