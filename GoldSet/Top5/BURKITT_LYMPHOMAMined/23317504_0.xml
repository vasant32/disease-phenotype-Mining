<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although chromatin targeting is a crucial function of Brd4, there is little understanding of how bromodomains that bind acetylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> are regulated, nor how the gene-specific activity of Brd4 is determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Via interaction screen and domain mapping, we identified p53 as a functional partner of Brd4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Brd4 association with p53 is modulated by casein kinase II (CK2)-mediated phosphorylation of a conserved acidic region in Brd4 that selectively contacts either a juxtaposed bromodomain or an adjacent basic region to dictate the ability of Brd4 binding to chromatin and also the recruitment of p53 to regulated promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The unmasking of bromodomains and activator recruitment, concurrently triggered by the CK2 phospho switch, provide an intriguing mechanism for gene-specific targeting by a universal epigenetic reader </plain></SENT>
