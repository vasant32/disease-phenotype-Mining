<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six lines derived from 22 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients were examined for cytoplasmic vs. surface immunoglobulin and the expression of the monoclonal-antibody-detected BLA, CALLA and LB-I antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six of the lines carried the variant translocations 8;2 or 8;22 (three each), 17 lines had the typical 8;14 translocation, I was translocation-negative (BJAB) and 2 were not examined cytogenetically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Depending on their immunoglobulin and surface marker expression, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines could be subdivided into several subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a strong inverse correlation between the expression of the CALLA and the LB-I marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BLA-lines were CALLA-, whereas the CALLA+ lines could be either BLA- or BLA+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six variant translocations belonged to the CALLA-BLA-LBI+ category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one set of three lines, derived from the patient with the 8;14 translocation, belonged to the same subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the typical vs. the variant translocation freezes the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell at a different stage of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The variant translocation-carrying subtypes represent probably a somewhat more advanced stage of differentiation </plain></SENT>
