<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October 1986 to October 1992, 133 eligible patients were enrolled: 74 with B-cell (surface immunoglobulin-positive [Slg+] <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) and 59 with stage IV small noncleaved-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (SNCCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 8 years; there were 103 males and 30 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Abdominal tumor</z:e> masses were prominent in 63 cases (33 B-ALL and 30 stage IV SNCCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 66 B-ALL and 57 stage IV patients (93% overall) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 4 years, the estimated event-free survival (EFS) rate is 65% +/- 8% for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> and 79% +/- 9% for those with stage IV SNCCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement, 23 of 36 remain in CR (4-year EFS rate, 64% +/- 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relapses occurred early; only 3 patients relapsed after completion of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen relapses occurred in the marrow, three in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, and six in other sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 11 CNS-positive patients who relapsed, only two recurred primarily in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that with intensified chemotherapy an increasing potential for cure exists for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> and stage IV SNCCL </plain></SENT>
