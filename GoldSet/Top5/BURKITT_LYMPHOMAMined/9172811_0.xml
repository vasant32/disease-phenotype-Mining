<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over a time period of five years leukemic blast samples from 141 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALL</z:e> were referred to our laboratory, for molecular evaluation of chromosome abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The t(9;22), t(4;11) and t(1;19) which are most commonly found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALL</z:e> with a B-precursor phenotype were molecularly analyzed by similar RT-PCR based protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BCR-ABL transcripts generated by the t(9;22) translocation were demonstrated in 36 patients (25%) and were restricted to the 109 patients with B precursor ALL (33% of this group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 83 patients showing a, common phenotype (CD10+), 34 were BCR-ABL positive (41%) whereas only 2 out of 26 with Null ALL (HLADr+, CD19+, CD10) were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the percent of BCR-ABL positive CD1O+ ALL increases significantly with age being 20% in patients less than 30 years old and more than 50% in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> (24 patients) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> (8 patients) were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of cases (67%) showed the p190 gene subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cytogenetic diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome was always confirmed by the molecular analysis and this approach allowed for the detection of the presence of the BCR-ABL rearrangement in 26 patients when a negative result or no metaphases were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The complete remission rate was similar among BCR-ABL positive and negative patients but a shorter remission duration was observed in those showing molecular evidence of t(9;22) and this finding was significantly evident in CD1O+ ALL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By means of comparison, in most of the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALL</z:e> patients, we analyzed the yet unrecognized prevalence of the t(4;11) and t(1;19) translocations by the molecular analysis of their chromosomal breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements of the ALL-1 gene on 11q23 band and ALL- l1AF.4 fusion transcripts specific for the t(4;11) were demonstrated in 7 out of the 21 Null ALL investigated, with no additional positive cases found among the other ALL subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall the clinical behavior of t(4; 11) positive patients was dismal with a very short CR duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Chimeric E2A-PBX1 transcripts generated by the t(1;19) were found in only two of the 87 B-precursor ALL analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presented results provide further evidence for the utility of RT-PCR based methods for the molecular diagnosis of chromosome translocations in ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The identification of such abnormalities can significantly contribute to the identification of more appropriate therapeutic options for standard and high risk ALL patients </plain></SENT>
