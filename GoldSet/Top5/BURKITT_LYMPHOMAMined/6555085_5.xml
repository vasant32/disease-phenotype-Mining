<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vanadate increased tyrosine phosphorylation up to 5-fold; serine and threonine phosphorylation were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The stimulation was detectable within 15 s at 0 degrees C and at concentrations of vanadate (0.3 and 1.0 microM) present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues and blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tyrosine phosphorylation of two substrates, M1 61 000 and 55 000, was dependent upon vanadate and incorporation into these substrates represented the majority of the vanadate-sensitive tyrosine phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
