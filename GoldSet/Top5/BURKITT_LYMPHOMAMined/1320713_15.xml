<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the effect of different types of fatty acids, bound to serum proteins in physiological conditions, on the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> composition and growth of human neoplastic B and T-cell lines and compared their effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocyte proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fatty acids with 0 to 2 unsaturations (stearic, oleic, and linoleic), at concentrations up to 50 or 100 microM did not significantly affect the proliferation of leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, long-chain <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> (PUFA), and mainly docosahexaenoic (22:6, n-3), were cytotoxic at concentrations greater than or equal to 20 microM after 48-72 h in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous supplementation with vitamin E restored <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The amount of end-products of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in cells correlated with the observed toxicity but the amount of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxides</z:chebi> did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fatty acid supplementations increased cell triacylglycerol content but did not affect the degree of unsaturation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, cholesterol/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> molar ratio, or membrane fluidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">Glutathione</z:chebi>-S-transferase activity was low in Raji and CEM cells, moderate in lymphocytes and high in Ramos cells and did not increase with supplementations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes, which produced lower amounts of end-products of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> perodixation, was not inhibited, but in some cases stimulated, by PUFA (with the exception of 30 microM 22:6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The extension of these results to situations in vivo could lead to use of PUFA for delaying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> progression or in adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
