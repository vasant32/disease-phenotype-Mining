<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Raji cells were fixed to microplate wells, then reacted with serum samples or aggregated human IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG was used to detect bound complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a linear relationship between aggregated IgG added and optical density reading, with less than 2 micrograms/ml of aggregated IgG readily detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When applied to human serum this technique gave results comparable to those obtained with the standard Raji cell assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Raji micro-ELISA is simpler to perform than the standard assay, is equally reliable, and avoids the hazards of radioactivity </plain></SENT>
