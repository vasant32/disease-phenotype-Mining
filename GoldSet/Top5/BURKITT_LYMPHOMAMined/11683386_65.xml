<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emerin interacted with in vitro translated lamins A, B1 and C in co-immunprecipitation reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Competition reactions revealed a clear preference for interactions between emerin and lamin C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Structural associations between lamins and emerin were investigated in four human cell lines displaying abnormal expression and/or localisation of lamins A and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each cell line absence of lamins A and C from the nuclear envelope (NE) was correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-localisation of endogenous and exogenous emerin to the ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two cell lines that did not express lamin A but did express lamin C, lamin C as well as emerin was <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-localised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When GFP-lamin A was expressed in SW13 cells (which normally express only very low levels of endogenous lamin A and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-localise endogenous emerin and lamin C), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three proteins became associated with the NE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When GFP-lamin C was expressed in SW13 cells neither the endogenous nor the exogenous lamin C was localised to the NE and emerin remained in the ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, lamins A and C were selectively eliminated from the NE of HeLa cells using a dominant negative mutant of lamin B1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elimination of these lamins from the lamina led to the accumulation of emerin as aggregates within the ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that lamin A is essential for anchorage of emerin to the inner nuclear membrane and of lamin C to the lamina </plain></SENT>
