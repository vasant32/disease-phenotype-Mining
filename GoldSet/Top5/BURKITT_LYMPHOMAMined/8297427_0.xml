<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of methods are available for classifying lymphoid and myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> in peripheral blood and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in clinical diagnosis an initial and particularly important step is morphologic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the cells in this investigation were classified by two hematologic experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In most cases, immunophenotyping and immunocytochemical analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Routinely prepared Romanowsky-Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears (approximately 23,000 cells) were scanned by a high-resolution color TV/microscope system and analyzed by color and texture algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to blast cells, lymphocytes and monocytes exhibited a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated change in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The calculated texture and color features were most significant for the subtyping performed by the statistical program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With multivariate statistical analysis, seven mathematical subtypes of lymphocytes and five of monocytes could be found over <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>Acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, M1-M2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004820'>acute myelomonocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (AMMOL, M4) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004845'>acute monocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (AMOL, M5) could be differentiated by their distributions of monocyte subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, this was impossible for the lymphocyte subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>Acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>) were discernible with the aid of lymphocyte subtypes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloid conditions from <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, such as with the Epstein-Barr virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The method increased the relevance of image processing in clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> and showed that the "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" cell populations were not really <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
