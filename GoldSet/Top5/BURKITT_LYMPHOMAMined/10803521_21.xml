<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has been unclear as to whether this is a selective process mediated by specific chemoattractant molecules, or simply a reflection of the highly motile nature of early B cell precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We further characterized this process using a transwell culture system, in which the two chambers were separated by an 8 microm diameter microporous membrane, through which leukemic cells could move </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When a BMF layer was grown on the upper surface of the membrane there was an 84.1% reduction in transmigration of the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> cell line NALM-6 into the lower chamber, compared to control membrane with no BMF layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Localization of leukemic cells under the BMF layer was confirmed ultrastructurally, suggesting the possibility that the migration of leukemic cells was directed by a chemotactic agent secreted by BMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The involvement of the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in this process was next investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMF were shown to express m-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> for SDF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Addition of SDF-1 at 100 ng/ml into the lower chamber increased transmigration of NALM-6 across the membrane by 2.2-fold, and also induced a 1.4- to 6.1-fold increase in movement of NALM-6 through a BMF layer into the lower chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The receptor for SDF-1, CXCR4, was demonstrated by flow cytometry on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 cases of precursor-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B ALL</z:e> analyzed, as well as on NALM-6, KM-3 and REH lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An inhibitory antibody to CXCR4 was able to block the migration of NALM-6 cells into BMF monolayers grown on plastic by 51%, and in nine cases of ALL by 8-40%, as well as partially inhibit transmigration of leukemic cells through BMF layers along an SDF-1 concentration gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that precursor-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B ALL</z:e> cells selectively localize within bone marrow stroma in vitro, and that this process is partially due to the stromal chemokine SDF-1 binding to its receptor CXCR4 on leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SDF-1 may be important in influencing the localization of precursor-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B ALL</z:e> cells in marrow microenvironmental inches which regulate their survival and proliferation </plain></SENT>
