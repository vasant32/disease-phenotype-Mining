<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the time of diagnosis, 74% of the bone marrow cells were lymphoblastoid cells, which were large and homogeneous in size, and whose cytoplasm was abundant and intensely basophilic containing many vacuoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lambda-light chains were detected as surface immunoglobulin (Ig), but not heavy chains or kappa-light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr (EB) <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome was detected in the cultured bone marrow cells by spot hybridization method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal banding studies of bone marrow cells revealed t(8; 22) (q24; q11) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 18 metaphases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This translocation brings the Ig lambda-light chain gene on chromosome 22q11 to chromosome 8q24 where the c-myc proto-oncogene is localized, which is thought to be closely associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> of this disorder, whereas EB <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome is observed in African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To our best knowledge, however, there have been no reported Japanese patients with L3 ALL in whom t(8; 22) or EB <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome was observed </plain></SENT>
