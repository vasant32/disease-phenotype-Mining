<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> in 28 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) patients who obtained a clinicohematologic remission after intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of 28 patients (57%) showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> number of circulating B-lymphocytes, as demonstrated by the low percentage of mouse rosette-forming cells (M-RFC), surface immunoglobulins (SIg), and CD24-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically, a lower number of relapses occurred in this group of patients compared to those with a persistent expansion of peripheral B-cells (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to assess monoclonality of the residual peripheral B-cell population, the distribution of SIg light chains was investigated on the B-cell-enriched fraction of 15 of these 16 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only six of them had a kappa/lambda ratio which ranged between 1.7:1 and 3:1, whereas the remaining patients still displayed a clearly imbalanced kappa/lambda Ig light chain distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the analysis of the configuration of the Ig heavy chain gene region, performed in nine cases (including five of the above six cases), showed the persistence of a rearranged pattern in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases tested but one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, residual monoclonal B-cells were found also in the majority of cases which displayed the lowest kappa/lambda ratio, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> and a long-lasting clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Studies at the DNA level confirm that a remission is rarely achieved in this disease in spite of intensive and prolonged chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the follow-up of B-CLL patients by conventional immunologic markers may be helpful to better define response to therapy and to predict the occurrence of clinical relapse </plain></SENT>
