<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study addressed the possible relationship between B-cell maturation stage of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status, ethnic group, or type of chromosome translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven cell lines obtained at the International Agency for Research on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> from 51 patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analyses of 54 cells lines were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell size, surface immunoglobulins (sIgs), cytoplasmic immunoglobulins (cIgs), mouse red blood cell receptors, and reactivity with various monoclonal antibodies were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin (Ig) class secretions were measured in the supernatant of 2- and 5-day cultures from 33 cell lines, with the use of a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From this study, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> appears to cover a broad range of the B-cell differentiation sequence, since the following Ig phenotypes were observed: null cells (sIg-, cIg-), large pre-B-cells (intracytoplasmic mu-chains), small B-cells (sIg+, cIg-), and various types of secreting B-cells (sIg+, cIg+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the latter, various patterns of cIg could be defined (perinuclear, paranuclear, and vesicular) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B-cell maturation stages were correlated with the amount of secreted Ig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In sIg+ cell lines, different classes of Ig were found: 35 IgM, 10 IgM plus IgD, 4 IgG, and 1 IgA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the different monoclonal antibodies used was specific to a precise stage of maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The stages of maturation were correlated with neither the type of chromosome translocations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> nor the presence of EBV genome, but the most immature cell lines were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBV positive and most of them originated from African patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, the common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> antigen (CD10) was expressed on nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines of intermediate maturation stages but only on half of the pre-B ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, none of the cell lines tested was found to react with CD5 antibodies, which recognize most of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> of the same stage of maturation as that in the B-lymphocyte lineage </plain></SENT>
