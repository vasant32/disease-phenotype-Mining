<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the sheep-cell rosette test (which is believed to identify T-lymphocytes), we found a significant reduction in the proportion of rosette-forming cells (RFC) in the samples from untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After reduction of remission the difference between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients and controls was abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rosette formation was more readily inhibited by anti-lymphocyte globulin (ALG) in samples from untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients than in controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings are compatible with the presence, in untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, of a circulating factor which impairs the capacity of T-lymphocytes to form rosettes with sheep erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
