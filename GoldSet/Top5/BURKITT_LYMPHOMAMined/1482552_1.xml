<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although lamin B is present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell types, lamins A and C are absent from embryonic cells and most undifferentiated cells from hematopoietic lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the nuclear lamina protein composition of the Raji cell line, lymphoblast-like cells established from a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lamins A and C were confirmed absent by immunodetection and Northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides lamins B and D/E, a protein migrating around 71 kilodaltons was recognized by a serum directed against the nuclear lamina of BHK-21 fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cellular localization by sequential extraction established this 71-kilodalton protein as an exclusive component of the nuclear lamina fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the nuclear lamina has a more complex composition than previously thought to be the case for cells devoid of lamins A and C </plain></SENT>
