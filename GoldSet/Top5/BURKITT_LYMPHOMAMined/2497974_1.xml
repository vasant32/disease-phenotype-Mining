<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that polyvalent antiimmunoglobulin antibodies directed at appropriate cell surface light (L) or heavy (H) immunoglobulin (Ig) chains will inhibit proliferation and the expression of c-myc and mu-Ig chain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines bearing 8;14 chromosomal translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This effect was not observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines bearing 8;22 translocations or in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines which did not express surface Ig or in karyotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antiproliferative effect was reproducible and resulted in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the most sensitive cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decrease in gene expression preceded the antiproliferative effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of anti-Ig on gene expression was relatively specific since the level of total (shown by Northern blots) and cytoplasmic (dot blots) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of several other genes (beta-actin, G6PD, kappa-L chain) and the first exon of c-myc (in cell lines in which this exon is expressed separately from the second and third exons) was not changed in these same <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of both c-myc and mu was maximally inhibited between 3 and 6 h after the addition of anti-Ig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the most sensitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line, concurrent reduction in c-myc and mu <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was noted as early as 1 h after anti-Ig and the nadir of expression of these genes occurred at 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the deregulated high constitutive expression of c-myc in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> can be down-regulated by anti-Ig resulting in inhibition of proliferation and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition these data are consistent with the possibility that in at least some 8;14 bearing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> occurs in an immature B-cell undergoing antigen-independent differentiation </plain></SENT>
