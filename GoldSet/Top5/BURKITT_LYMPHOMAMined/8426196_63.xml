<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred five consecutive children with early B-lineage ALL were treated according to the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) protocol between January 1986 and July 1, 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therapy included a four-drug induction followed by consolidation and continuation phases of nightly oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50667">mercaptopurine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi>) and repetitive courses of divided-dose oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (dMTX) and asparaginase (L-asp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (Ara-C) were given during consolidation and later, during continuation, two doses were given 3 to 4 days apart, every 9 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy was given throughout the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred three of the 205 patients entered remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only eight of these 203 children have had a bone marrow relapse (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, 10 other children have developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> 23 to 68 months following the diagnosis of ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall event-free survival (EFS) at 4 years is 79.3% +/- 5.1%, with a risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> at 4 years of 5.9% +/- 3.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This experience provides strong evidence for a link between epipodophyllotoxin therapy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> since none of these children received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> therapy or irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This serious complication raises concern as to the appropriate use of epipodophyllotoxins in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
