<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently we found that many different mature B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> proliferate upon stimulation via the CD40 antigen, and this led us to investigate whether a similar CD40 activation on ALL cells could also induce proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, we measured CD40 expression in 21 ALL cases; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were CD40+, although mostly weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Next, we triggered the CD40 antigen by anti-CD40 antibodies and by a CD40 ligand-expressing cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we measured the influence of IL-3, IL-4 and IL-7 with and without these stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 8/10 cases proliferation, measured by 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation, could be induced after CD40 crosslinking, especially in the presence of IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stimulation via the CD40 ligand was more successful than using crosslinked anti-CD40 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-4 inhibited the spontaneous proliferation found in three cases, but stimulated proliferation after CD40 crosslinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL-7 did not contribute to proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Morphology</z:mp>, immunophenotyping and surface marker analysis, combined with DNA flow cytometry confirmed that the proliferation found could be ascribed to the ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, B-lineage ALL cases are CD40+, and many can be cultured using CD40 stimulation and IL-3 </plain></SENT>
