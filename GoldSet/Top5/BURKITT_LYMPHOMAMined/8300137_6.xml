<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal antibody (UV4) against the human IL-6 receptor (hIL-6R) was generated by immunizing BALB/c mice with both a human <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line (U266) and a murine cell line (M12.4/R) transfected with the hIL-6R cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that UV 4 stains the hIL-6R+ cell lines U266 and U937, but not the hIL-6R- cell lines Daudi and K562 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Competitive inhibition assays demonstrated that preincubation of U266 cells with UV4 inhibited the binding of a phycoerythrin (PE)-IL-6 conjugate to the hIL-6R and also inhibited the proliferative activity of IL-6 on the IL-6-dependent human <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines ILKM2 and ILKM3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, UV4 did not interfere with the proliferation of the hIL-6R- Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct sandwich radioimmunoassays further confirmed that the UV4 bound to the same molecule as the goat anti-hIL-6R antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that both UV4 and human IL-6 bind to the same or adjacent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on the hIL-6R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This monoclonal antibody should facilitate studies of the structure-function relationship of IL-6R and may be useful for the treatment of IL-6-dependent diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
