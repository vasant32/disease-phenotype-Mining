<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent years, although many efforts, such as high-intensity, short-duration combination chemotherapy, have been devoted to improve therapy for this rapidly proliferating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, there are still significant treatment-associated toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there remains a need for novel effective therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a role of "fine tuning" in the physiological and pathological differentiation process, by which cells can rapidly regulate dynamic events such as cell-lineage decisions and morphogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This unique miRNA feature shifts the traditional one drug target paradigm to a novel one drug multiple targets paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we found that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines exhibited an extremely low expression of miR-150, and then restored miR-150 expression at physiologic levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines, i.e. Daudi, Raji, BJAB and Ramos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that re-expression of miR-150 reduced proliferation of Daudi and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Daudi and Raji, both of which are EBV-positive germinal center B-cell (GC B) origin, transduced with miR-150 can be rescued to differentiate toward B-cell terminal stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no significant changes were observed in BJAB and Ramos cells which are EBV-negative GC B origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of note, re-expression of miR-150 also resulted in decreasing c-Myb protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, c-Myb knockdown in Daudi and Raji cell lines recapitulated the partial characteristics similar to that caused by re-expression of miR-150 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our findings demonstrate that miR-150 can induce EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> differentiation by targeting c-Myb </plain></SENT>
