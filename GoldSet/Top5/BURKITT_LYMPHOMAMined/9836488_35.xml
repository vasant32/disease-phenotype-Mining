<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mapping of the rates and comparisons with a range of geographical variables indicate completely different distributions for KS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> but a degree of similarity in the occurrence of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and other NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparisons with rates elsewhere in the world suggest, most notably, that KS was as common in some regions of sub-Saharan Africa as was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the colon</z:e> in much of Western Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison with data from the era of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> indicates 20-fold increases in the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo> in Uganda and Zimbabwe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were three to four times the rates for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> at young ages in Western populations, but the general incidence of other NHL was no higher than in the West and very low rates were indicated for much of southern Africa </plain></SENT>
