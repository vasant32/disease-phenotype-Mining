<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In addition to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA and LMP latency genes, there is a family of alternatively spliced BamHI-A rightward transcripts (BARTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These latency transcripts are highly expressed in the EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and are expressed at lower levels in latently EBV-infected B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The contribution of the BARTs to EBV biology or pathogenesis is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resting B cells have recently been recognized as a reservoir for EBV persistence in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these cells, EBV gene expression is tightly restricted and the only <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene known to be consistently expressed is LMP2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used cell sorting and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to examine whether BARTs are expressed in the restricted form of in vivo latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> with splicing diagnostic for transcripts containing the BART RPMS1 and BARFO open-reading frames (ORFs) were expressed in CD19(+) but not in CD23(+) B cells isolated from peripheral blood of healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The product of the proximal RPMS1 ORF has not previously been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The RPMS1 ORF was shown to encode a 15-kD protein that localized to the nucleus of transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of the BARTs in peripheral blood B cells suggests that the proteins encoded by these transcripts are likely to be important for maintenance of in vivo latency </plain></SENT>
