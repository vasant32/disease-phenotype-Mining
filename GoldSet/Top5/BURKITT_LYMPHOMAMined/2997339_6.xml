<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined the molecular mechanisms involved in the induction and regulation of expression of alpha and beta 1 human interferons (HuIFN) in Namalva cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cloned IFN-alpha and -beta 1 cDNAs, and antisera to purified IFN-alpha and -beta 1 were used as specific probes to determine the expression of HuIFN genes both on the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rates of gene transcription were correlated with the relative levels of HuIFN <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> present in induced cells and with the amounts of HuIFN <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> synthesized by these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The comparative rate of transcription of HuIFN-alpha and -beta 1 genes was measured in nuclei isolated from Namalva cells before and after induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No transcription of HuIFN-alpha and -beta 1 genes was detected in nuclei isolated from the uninduced cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correspondence in the rate of HuIFN-alpha and -beta 1 genes transcription after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> with the relative levels of HuIFN <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the induced cells indicates that the stimulation of HuIFN synthesis by <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> results from the activation of the transcription of HuIFN genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative levels of alpha and beta 1 induced transcripts were the same in spite of the differences in the number of copies of HuIFN-alpha and -beta 1 genes indicating that the beta 1 gene is transcribed more efficiently than the alpha genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The steady-state levels of HuIFN-alpha and -beta 1 mRNAs in induced Namalva cells are comparable, however, the overall amount of HuIFN-beta 1 synthesized (as determined by radioimmunoassay and biological activity) is approximately 10-fold lower than that of IFN-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No evidence has been found that would indicate that HuIFN-beta 1 mRNA induced in Namalva cells is different from that induced in human fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data indicate, however, that in Namalva cells, the IFN-beta 1 polypeptide has a higher turnover rate and slower rate of release into medium than the HuIFN-alpha <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi>, indicating that the observed difference in the overall amounts of these two types of interferons present in the medium is due to regulation on posttranslational level </plain></SENT>
