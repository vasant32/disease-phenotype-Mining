<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the role of c-Myc in stimulating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and lymphangiogenesis in a highly metastatic murine model of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (E micro -c-myc), where c-Myc is expressed exclusively in B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of bone marrow and lymph nodes from young (preneoplastic) E micro -c-myc transgenic mice revealed increased growth of blood vessels, which are functional by dye flow assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lymphatic sinuses also increased in size and number within the lymph nodes, as demonstrated by immunostaining for with a lymphatic endothelial marker 10.1.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 10.1.1 antibody recognizes VEGFR-2- and VEGFR-3-positive lymphatic sinuses and vessels within lymph nodes, and also recognizes lymphatic vessels in other tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneously injected dye traveled more efficiently through draining lymph nodes in E micro -c-myc mice, indicating that these hypertrophic lymphatic sinuses increase lymph flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Purified B lymphocytes and lymphoid tissues from E micro -c-myc mice expressed increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by immunohistochemical or immunoblot assays, which could promote blood and lymphatic vessel growth through interaction with VEGFR-2, which is expressed on the endothelium of both vessel types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that constitutive c-Myc expression stimulates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and lymphangiogenesis, which may promote the rapid growth and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of c-Myc-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
