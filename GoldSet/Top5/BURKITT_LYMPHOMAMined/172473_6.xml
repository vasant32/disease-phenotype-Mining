<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Namalwa and three of the hybrids produce interferon while the four other hybrids, like Raji, do not </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High extracellular concentrations of interferon likewise had little effect on EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> of Raji or the hybrid cells and it is possible that Raji produces some factor that antagonizes the action of interferon to allow virus expression </plain></SENT>
