<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we analysed its effects on cell cycle progression and differentiation of Daudi <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The parallel analysis in light microscopy and cytofluorimetry by means of anti-BrdU monoclonal antibodies showed a reduced rate of proliferation (S phase) with a G1 arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These features were confirmed by the lower incorporation of [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> supporting the decrease in the rate of DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition this cytokine was able to induce differentiation after 24 hrs of treatment as assessed by the increased expression of Fc receptors (FcR) and morphological criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This multiparametric analysis gives evidence to the sensitivity to this cytokine of this peculiar cell line </plain></SENT>
