<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have searched for host cellular proteins that interact with EBNA-1 protein in various B cell lines latently infected with EBV, including a recently EBV growth-transformed cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By using gel shift analysis, we investigated the interactions of an oligonucleotide containing a single EBNA-1 recognition site, derived from the family of repeats (FR) element of oriP, with protein from cell extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The FR oligonucleotide bound a (72-kD) cellular protein in the absence of EBNA-1 and without induction of the previously reported 'anti-EBNA-1 proteins' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FR oligonucleotide formed complexes with additional proteins from EBNA-1-synthesizing cell lines; these complexes were abolished or supershifted by anti-EBNA-1 monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE analyses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>-Met-labeled proteins that bound to a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>- conjugated FR oligonucleotide, fractionated by a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> gradient centrifugation and affinity-purified with streptavidin, showed three major bands, a 72-kD protein, the FR binding of which seemed to be independent of EBNA-1, a 64-kD protein in both EBNA-1-transfected and latently EBV-infected cell lines, and a 45-kD protein in EBV-infected cell lines, which was most prominent in a recently EBV growth-transformed cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The FR element forms complexes with cellular proteins in the absence and presence of EBNA-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These 72-, 64- and 45-kD cellular proteins might be involved in the function of the oriP and EBNA-1 system </plain></SENT>
