<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cryptic translocation t(12;21)(p13;q22), which leads to the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 fusion gene, is the most common abnormality in childhood B-cell ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 fusion in childhood and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0279593" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult B-cell ALL</z:e> using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) and its association with additional changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FISH, using dual-color extra-signal (ES) DNA probe specific for the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> and AML1 genes, was performed either on blast cells suspensions stored in liquid nitrogen immediately after Ficoll or on leukemic cells preserved in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50913">fixative</z:chebi> solution at -20 degrees C after short-term culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 fusion was observed in the 26 ALL adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fusion was found among 19.6% of the 57 ALL children, additional changes being identified by conventional cytogenetics in 80% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A deletion of the untranslocated <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> was observed in 36.3% of the ALL with the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The coexpression of myelocytic and B-lymphoid antigens was found in 3 of the 11 of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 fusion positive-ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results (frequency of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 fusion in children and of the deletion of the untranslocated <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> allele, mean age of the patients and white blood cell count) are within the range observed by others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Structural chromosomal abnormalities other than the t(12;21) are frequent and may play a role in the prognosis of these patients </plain></SENT>
