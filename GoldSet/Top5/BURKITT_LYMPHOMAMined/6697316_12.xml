<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of these had jaw involvement, 16 at presentation and 2 at relapse (mean age, 16 years; M:F ratio 1.6:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of these 18 patients was black </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 16 patients presenting initially with jaw <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 14 were first evaluated by their dentist; 8 were 16 years of age or older (adults) and 6 were younger than 16 years of age (children) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Toothache and perioral numbness were the most frequent findings in adults, whereas toothache, loose teeth, intra-oral and extra-oral swelling were the most common complaints in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were treated with antibiotic therapy and/or dental extractions for presumed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tooth infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution of jaw lesions was: unilateral mandibular (7), unilateral maxillary (4), bilateral mandibular (5), and four quadrants (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiologic evaluation was abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 17 cases evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only three patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children) had disease limited to the jaw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of eight children and 3 of 10 adults are long-term survivors with a median follow-up of seven years (range, 2-15 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>American Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with jaw involvement differs from African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (AFBL) with jaw involvement in a number of ways: (1) the incidence of jaw <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in adults is similar to that in children; (2) the incidence of jaw <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is not greater in males; (3) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is considerably more limited in extent with a single quadrant mandibular lesion being the most common presentation; and (4) clinical presentation also differs, with toothache and perioral numbness, uncommon in AFBL, being the most frequent complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These marked differences in the frequency and clinical characteristics of jaw <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> of AMBL and AFBL are consistent with other findings indicating that these diseases may differ phenotypically </plain></SENT>
