<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated following <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure, are considered to trigger the development of hematopoietic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, although little supporting evidence has been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether the experimental elimination of ROS generated following <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure prevents the development of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced hematopoietic disorders to clarify the mechanism underlying the development of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced hematopoietic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: C57BL/6 mice, overexpressing human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> (h-Trx-Tg), were used to examine the possible nullification of ROS induction following <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experimental group was exposed to 300 ppm <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> 6 hours/day, 5 days/week, for 26 weeks, and lifetime observation followed by molecular and histopathological examinations were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The present study using h-Trx-Tg mice showed a complete suppression of the development of thymic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> inhalation (0% in h-Trx-Tg vs 30% in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (Wt) mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a 48% decrease in the incidence of clastogenic micronucleated reticulocyte induction in the h-Trx-Tg mice compared with the Wt control after 2 weeks of inhalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As underlying mechanisms, the attenuation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> was accompanied by a complete abrogation of hemato-lymphoid toxicity, as shown by the upregulation of the activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>-dismutase, and a consequently stable ROS level, as determined by cell sorting using 2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, along with a significant attenuation of the overexpression of a cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The attenuation of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and that of the consequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> were observed for the first time, and these indicate a role of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced clastogenesis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(These attenuations were not seen in nonthymic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> developed in C57BL/6 used in this study.) During the constitutive overexpression of h-Trx, the expression of aryl-<z:chebi fb="59" ids="24632">hydrocarbon</z:chebi> receptor in h-Trx-Tg mice was downregulated, which may also contribute to the attenuation </plain></SENT>
