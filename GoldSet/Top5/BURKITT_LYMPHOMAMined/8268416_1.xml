<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ST:FeSV-induced TM have been characterized both phenotypically and functionally, including their tumouricidal potential against <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (LS 180) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present results show that ST:FeSV-induced TM produced significant lysis of K-562 tumour cells, but essentially no lysis of the Daudi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lysis of K-562 tumour cells by the ST:FeSV-induced TM was considerably more effective in 1% than in 10% FCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Addition of TNF-alpha caused only a slight increase in the extent of lysis of K-562 tumour cells by the ST:FeSV-induced TM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coincubation of the ST:FeSV-induced TM with K-562 cells in agar medium resulted in the inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that ST:FeSV-induced TM are potent oncocytotoxic agents of K-562 tumour cells, but are considerably less effective against the Daudi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
