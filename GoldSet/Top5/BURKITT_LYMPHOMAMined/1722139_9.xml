<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Group I cells exhibit the phenotype of resting B cells and grow as single cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such lines can be Epstein-Barr-virus(EBV)-negative or -positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group II and group III cells are always EBV-positive, they express B cell activation markers, grow in aggregates and resemble in varying degrees lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied three groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines for their capacity to interact with allogeneic lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that as long as the lines have the group I phenotype, they do not stimulate allogeneic T lymphocytes irrespective whether they carry the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The group II and III cells are stimulatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Generally there was no correlation between sensitivity ot lymphocyte-mediated lysis and the phenotype of the lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one set of lines, the group I cells had higher sensitivity to both natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer effectors compared to the group II or III lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, such correlation could not be seen with the other two sets of lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the phenotypic features investigated, expression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules LFA-1 and LFA-3 correlated with the tendency for cell aggregation </plain></SENT>
