<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By analysis with a panel of CD21 MoAbs it is shown that a large part of the soluble CD21 in human blood plasma is of the long isoform (CD21L), as judged by comparison with antigen produced by mouse L cells transfected with CD21L-cDNA and reactivity with the restricted CD21 MoAb R4/23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is compatible with the hypothesis that soluble CD21 in the blood is mainly derived from follicular dendritic cells (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells from a human keratinocyte cell line transfected with cDNA from the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji also produced soluble CD21L (sCD21L), whereas the short form of sCD21 (sCD21S) was the major component of sCD21 produced by the B lymphoblastoid cell line LICR-LON-HMy and the T cell line Jurkat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Confocal studies of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> isolated from human tonsil revealed that CD21 was present in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On gel filtration sCD21 from untreated serum has an apparent size considerably greater than the 130kD found by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This may be partly accounted for by the non-globular shape of the molecule, but may also indicate, as reported by others, that in its native state sCD21 is complexed with other proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no evidence of complexing with sCD23 or C3d could be found </plain></SENT>
