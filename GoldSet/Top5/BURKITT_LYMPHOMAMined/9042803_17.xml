<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AR-PBL occurred late in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and were usually associated with other systemic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0234387" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral disorders</z:e> and with a low level of CD4 lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> according to the Working Formulation or updated Kiel classification, and often displayed a multifocal pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty cases were classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> with plasmacytic differentiation, 18 cases were large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> component or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 2 were small noncleaved non-Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (Working Formulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This latter category is classified as Burkitt's-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the REAL nomenclature </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of EBV was detected in most cases, and, when PCR was used, this was a constant finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 oncoprotein and latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) were strongly expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the tested cases expressed p53, or were rearranged for bcl-2 or c-myc oncogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the immunophenotypic specificity of AR-PBL, which may reflect the special immune status of the brain </plain></SENT>
