<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-derived lymphomatous cell lines have been established from 43 individuals: 24 Caucasians, 14 North Africans and five Africans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 27 lines (from 18 individuals) were established from non-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, indicating that the relative ease in cultivating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> malignant cells in vitro is not limited to EBV genome-containing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic investigations showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines had one of the three '<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> translocations' - t(8;14), t(8;22) or t(2;8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An estimate of the frequency of each translocation, based on the analysis of 51 independent IARC <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines gave the following results: t(8;14), 76%; t(8;22), 16%; t(2;8), 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This large panel of cell lines is now a valuable tool for analysing the various phenotypic characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparisons can be made between multiple lines of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> from high-, intermediate- and low-incidence areas; significant numbers of EBV genome-negative and -positive lines and of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells taken at diagnosis and at various stages of the disease can also be compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For molecular and immunological investigations, EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) were also established from non-malignant lymphocytes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 24 paired <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and LCL cell lines obtained so far will allow precise, controlled studies of the molecular consequences of chromosomal translocations and of the comparative susceptibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and LCL to immune effectors </plain></SENT>
