<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both forms have been prepared from Namalva (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After deacetylation, sequences of the inducible but nontranscribed interferon-beta genes are still part of the low mobility class of particles suggesting that they carry a member of the small HMG proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comparison of HMG-bonded and hyperacetylated particles on density gradient gels shows that in the first case slow mobilities arise from a reduced effective charge and in the second from an increased friction, i.e., a relaxed nucleosome structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interaction of HMG 14 with compact and relaxed nucleosomes has been compared to appreciate the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is shown that hyperacetylation reduces the affinity and cooperativity of binding HMG and may be a prerequisite for an efficient transcription </plain></SENT>
