<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three categories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> promoters and chemically related but inactive substances were tested for their effect on the cytotoxic activity of human blood lymphocytes against K562 and Daudi targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes incubated overnight in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol esters</z:chebi> 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate</z:chebi> [P(Bu)2] had enhanced function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incubation with 4-alpha-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi>-12,13-didecanoate was without effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enhancing activity was also exerted by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38958">indole alkaloids</z:chebi>, teleocidin and lyngbyatoxin A, and the polyacetates, aplysiatoxin and debromoaplysiatoxin, but not by dihydroteleocidin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-promoting compounds activated the cytotoxic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The substances acted in a dose-dependent manner with optimal activity at characteristic concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overnight incubation of lymphocytes at 4 degrees did not change their spontaneous cytotoxicity but abolished the enhancing effect of P(Bu)2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, P(Bu)2-induced activation occurred only on metabolically active cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The activation did not require DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar to controls, the P(Bu)2-treated cells required divalent cations and an intact cytoskeleton in order to perform their lytic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Experiments with the various metabolic inhibitors indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> treatment does not induce an alternative cytotoxic mechanism since, as with untreated lymphocytes, P(Bu)2-activated cells require contact with the target and intact secretory functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The enhanced cytolytic potential was not due to induction of alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) production, as shown by the fact that the effect was not abolished by addition of anti-IFN antibodies during the P(Bu)2 treatment of lymphocytes or during the cytotoxic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of antiserum against IFN reduced the cytotoxic potential of control cells, suggesting that endogenous IFN production contributes to the maintenance of lytic function in cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If this mechanism is counteracted by addition of anti-IFN serum, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol esters</z:chebi> can provide an alternative activation signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When P(Bu)2-activated lymphocytes were subsequently treated with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, their lytic capacity was further increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that P(Bu)2 and IFN activate cytotoxic potential through different pathways </plain></SENT>
