<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study analyzes the ABCG2 expression and activity in 46 human de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> B- and T-lineage (ALL) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ABCG2 expression was measured flow cytometrically with the BXP-34 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ABCG2 functional activity was determined flow cytometrically by measuring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> accumulation in combination with the ABCG2 inhibitor fumitremorgin C (FTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine a possible effect of the transporters P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1 and MRP2) on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> accumulation, the accumulation was investigated in the presence of the P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> inhibitor PSC 833 and MRP inhibitor MK-571 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ABCG2 gene was sequenced to investigate the amino acid at position 482 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In B-lineage ALL (n = 23), the median BXP-34:IgG1 ratio was higher, namely 2.4 (range, 1.7-3.7), than in T-lineage ALL (n = 23; 1.9; range, 1.2-6.6; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The addition of FTC to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> treatment caused a median increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> accumulation of 21% (range, 0-140%) in B-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In T-lineage ALL, this FTC effect was less pronounced (5%; range, 0-256%; P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The influence of FTC on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> accumulation correlated with ABCG2 protein expression (r = 0.52; P &lt; 0.001; n = 43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> accumulation, when FTC was added to cells treated with both PSC 833 and MK-571, correlated with the ABCG2 expression in B-lineage ALL but not in T-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sequencing the ABCG2 gene revealed no ABCG2 mutation at position 482 in patients who accumulated more rhodamine after FTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that ABCG2 is expressed higher and functionally more active in B-lineage than in T-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
