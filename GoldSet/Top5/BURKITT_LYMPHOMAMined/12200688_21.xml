<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic pathway activated by chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab, IDEC.C2B8) was analyzed using the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Ramos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Crosslinking of CD20 (CD20XL) induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Ramos cells, which involved loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)), the release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome-c</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>-c), and activation of caspases-9 and -3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, several lines of evidence showed that the apoptotic outcome did not depend on these events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, under circumstances where Ramos cells display resistance to either CD95- or B cell receptor (BCR)-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, CD20XL-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was not affected, pointing to a distinct pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk prevented processing of caspase-9, -3 and PARP as well as DNA fragmentation, but did not block <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as measured by annexin V staining, cell size and membrane integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lastly, Bcl-2 overexpression blocked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>-c release and the decrease in Deltapsi(m), and completely prevented CD95- or BCR-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>; however, it did not affect CD20XL-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that although CD20XL can initiate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway, CD20-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> does not necessarily require active caspases and cannot be blocked by Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since most chemotherapeutic drugs require the activation of caspases to exert their cytotoxicity, these findings provide an important rationale for the use of CD20 mAbs in chemoresistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
