<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Total intracellular MTX levels and exchangeable intracellular MTX levels were not significantly different in responding or non-responding patients at any MTX concentration, but increased four-fold for every ten-fold concentration increment studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extracellular MTX levels in excess of 10(-7)M appeared necessary to allow accumulation of exchangeable intracellular MTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>UdR incorporation at 10(-6)M and 10(-5)M differed significantly between responding and non-responding patients, with responders having less than 20% of control values and non-responders having greater than 40% of control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, increasing the extracellular MTX concentration from 10(-6)M to 10(-5)M produced no significant decrease in UdR incorporation in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic implications of this apparent threshold are discussed </plain></SENT>
