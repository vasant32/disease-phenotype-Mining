<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using measured variations in these characteristics for cells of two human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines, the model gave results for cell survival and the fundamental parameter of radiation sensitivity, z(0), that differ substantially from those obtained using only mean values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cell survival may be underestimated by a factor of 100 if only mean values of these cellular parameters are used, and calculated values of z(0) may be overestimated by a factor of 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of this effect stems from the variation in antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The magnitudes of the differences were found to be a function of the fractions of mean specific energy delivered by surrounding activity and by activity bound to the cells </plain></SENT>
