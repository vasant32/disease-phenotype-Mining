<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six established Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines from endemic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> groups of patients were examined for the expression of cross-reactive idiotypes (CRI) associated with VHI, VHIII, VHIV, VHVI, VKIIIa and VKIIIb heavy- and light-chain gene products, using a panel of anti-CRI and anti-subgroup monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Membrane, cytoplasmic and secreted immunoglobulins (Ig) were analysed by immunofluorescence, immunoperoxidase and ELISA respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While 35% of the lines expressed either of the VHIV-associated CRI, recognised by the MAbs 9G4 or LCI, none expressed the other VH-associated CRI included in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the kappa light chain expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines 54% and 46% belonged to the VKIII subgroup and VKIIIb sub-subgroups respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None, however, was found to express the VKIIIa or VKIIIb-associated CRI, recognised by the 6B6.6 and 17-109 MAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant association has been observed between the expression of the VHIV-associated CRI and the VKIII subgroup within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines derived from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> group of patients as compared with their endemic counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the expressed repertoire of Ig variable region genes within the malignant B lymphocytes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> is not random and that a highly selective mechanism(s) may operate on this subset of B lymphocytes, as evidenced by the expression of the VH and VK gene products </plain></SENT>
