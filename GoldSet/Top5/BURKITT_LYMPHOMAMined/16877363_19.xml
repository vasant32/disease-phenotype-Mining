<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reasons for this loss remained largely unknown as transcription factors with pleiotropic effects on B-cell-specific gene expression, namely E2A, EBF, and PAX5, are present in primary HRS cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show here that ID2, which can inactivate E2A and perhaps PAX5, is not detectable in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells but is strongly and uniformly expressed in HRS cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurrent chromosomal gains of the ID2 gene might contribute to this aberrant expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Co-immunoprecipitation of E2A with ID2 from HRS-derived cell lines together with the high amount of ID2 relative to the B-cell transcription factors E2A and PAX5 in HRS-derived cell lines and primary HRS cells indicated that aberrant ID2 expression contributes significantly to the loss of the B-cell-specific gene expression in HRS cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ID2 was also expressed in lymphocyte-predominance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, mediastinal large B-cell, diffuse large B-cell, and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, where lower amounts of ID2 relative to E2A and PAX5 compared with HRS cells might prevent a global down-regulation of B-cell-specific genes and ID2 may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> in other ways </plain></SENT>
