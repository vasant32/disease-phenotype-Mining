<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over-expression of ROR1 gene, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, has recently been reported in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> gene 1 (WT1) has long been known as a universal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> expressed in a variety of solid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the expression profile of ROR1 and WT1 was investigated in different immunophenotypic subsets of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR method was used to determine the ROR1 and WT1 genes expression in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples from 51 newly diagnosed Iranian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on immunophenotypic results, our <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> patients were classified in four differentiation subsets; Pro-B (n = 7), Pre-B I (n = 29), Pre-B II (n = 13) and Immature/mature <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although ROR1 was over-expressed in more mature subsets (16.7%, 42.9%, 45.5% and 100%, respectively), WT1 was more represented in immature subsets of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> patients (57.1%, 64.3%, 38.5% and 0%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the frequency of ROR1 and WT1 positive samples at each immunophenotypic subtype revealed statistically significant difference only in Pre B I subtype (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that expression of ROR1 and WT1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> is associated with the differentiation stage of the leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
