<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cell line used was the Raji line established from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cloning efficiency (CE) in soft agar of the cells was enhanced approximately 5-fold by addition of 2 x 10(-4) to 4 x 10(-4)M dithiothreitol (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="16130">DDT</z:chebi>) and 1% human serum, as compared with the CE in control medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiols</z:chebi> such a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41218">mercaptoethanol</z:chebi> and thioglycerin were also able to increase the CE but not as efficiently as DTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under these culture conditions, 10(6) cells per 55-mm dish could be seeded into soft agar medium containing 5 micrograms/ml 6-thioguanine (6-TG) to detect a forward mutation without any metabolic cooperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The optimum expression time was determined by treating the cells with 125 micrograms/ml ethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25224">methanesulfonate</z:chebi> (EMS) for 20 hr at 37 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant increase of mutation frequency was observed approximately 10 days after the 6-TG treatment, by which time the cells had gone through about 10 population doublings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After determining these experimental conditions, a comparison of mutation frequency among three <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi>, EMS, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="21759">N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="21183">ICR-170</z:chebi>, was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ICr-170 was the most efficient <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagen</z:chebi> among these chemicals </plain></SENT>
