<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate that the substitution of the DRA TATA sequence with the TATA box from the adenovirus E1b promoter removes the requirement for the octamer binding site for high levels of expression from the DRA promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since only the TATA box from the E1b but not the DRA promoters binds the TATA binding protein, we conclude that the octamer binding site helps to recruit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> to the DRA promoter </plain></SENT>
