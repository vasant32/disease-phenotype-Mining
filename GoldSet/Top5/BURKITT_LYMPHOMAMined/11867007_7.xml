<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was shown to be the causal agent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (IM) in 1968, and many reports followed linking EBV to several other clinical syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1970, the virus was shown to be able to immortalize B lymphocytes, which are one of its target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This oncogenic potential underlies the role of EBV in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, post-transplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in HIV-infected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, EBV can infect epithelial cells in the nasopharynx and is a co-factor for development of nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is no treatment available for IM to date; however, virus-associated complications may be treated with various modes of immune modulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Currently, radiotherapy and chemotherapy remain the main treatments for EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence has suggested that adoptive therapy through infusions of human leukocyte-associated antigen-matched EBV cytotoxic T cells may form a novel strategy for both prophylaxis and treatment of EBV-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a vaccine based on immunization with a structural antigen, gp350, is under evaluation </plain></SENT>
