<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that the antigen expression frequencies were as follows: CD19 (100%), HLA-DR (98.9%), CD38 (88.5%), CD10 (76.8%) and CD34 (76.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD117 and T antigens (CD2 and CD7) were rarely expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Childhood group (&lt;or= 14 years) had the highest frequency of CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adolescent (15 - 18 years) and adult groups (&gt;or= 19 years) had a higher expression rate of myeloid antigens (CD13 and/or CD33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subtype CD10(+)/CD34(+) took the highest percentage in three age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Percentages of CD10(-)/CD34(+) group increased by age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subtype CD10(-)/CD34(+) had the highest myeloid antigen co-expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparing with CD45-positive cases, those with CD45-negative or CD45(+/-) always had higher CD10 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bcr/abl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was evaluated in 43 samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Myeloid antigen co-expression was not different in bcr/abl(+) and bcr/abl(-) groups, and m-bcr/abl(+) was mainly observed in subtype CD10(+)/CD34(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cells expressed CD19(+), HLA-DR(+), and CD117(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CD34, CD10 and CD45 expression varied in different maturation stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotypic subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> in adolescents was similar to that in the adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Blasts with CD45(+) were mostly seen in CD10(-) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CD13 and/or CD33 co-expression was fewer in children patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>m-bcr/abl(+) was mainly seen in subtype CD10(+)/CD34(+) </plain></SENT>
