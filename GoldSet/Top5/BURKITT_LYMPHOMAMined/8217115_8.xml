<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eleven cases were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The crude annual incidence was 0.51/10(5) and the age-adjusted (world standard population) incidence 0.23/10(5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The male-to-female ratio of age-adjusted incidence rates was 2.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common histological type was large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> comprising 61% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> classifiable cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> comprised 12%, centrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 9%, peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 9%, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 7% and large-cell anaplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 3% of the total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the jejunum, almost one half of the cases were T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with definite MALT features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had higher survival rates than intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> slightly higher survival rates than T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and low-grade MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> higher survival rates than other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> differed only slightly from each other in prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The histological grade according to the Working Formulation correlated with survival rates, but a great majority of cases were classified as intermediate grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Classification of GI <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> into the types mentioned above appears to correlate with several clinical and pathological parameters </plain></SENT>
