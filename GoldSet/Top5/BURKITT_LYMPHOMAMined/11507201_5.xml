<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, including nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and, somewhat controversially, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV infects and efficiently transforms human primary B lymphocytes in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of EBV-encoded genes are critical for EBV-mediated transformation of human B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we show that an EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell line obtained from the spontaneous outgrowth of B cells from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patient contains a deletion, which involves a region of approximately 16 kbp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This deletion encodes major EBV genes involved in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and transformation of human primary B lymphocytes and includes the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> gp350, the entire open reading frame of EBNA3A, and the amino-terminal region of EBNA3B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A fusion protein created by this deletion, which lies between the BMRF1 early antigen and the EBNA3B latent antigen, is truncated immediately downstream of the junction 21 amino acids into the region of the EBNA3B sequence, which is out of frame with respect to the EBNA3B protein sequence, and indicates that EBNA3B is not expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fusion is from EBV coordinate 80299 within the BMRF1 sequence to coordinate 90998 in the EBNA3B sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we have shown that there is no detectable induction in <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication observed when SNU-265 is treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol esters</z:chebi>, and no transformants were detected when supernatant is used to infect primary B lymphocytes after 8 weeks in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have identified an EBV genome with a major deletion in critical genes involved in mediating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and the transformation of human primary B lymphocytes that is incompetent for replication of this naturally occurring EBV isolate </plain></SENT>
