<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The c-Fos and c-Jun transcription factors are rapidly turned over in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the multiple pathways responsible for their breakdown is probably initiated by calpains, which are cytoplasmic calcium-dependent cysteine proteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The c-fos gene has been transduced by two murine oncogenic retroviruses called Finkel-Biskis-Jenkins murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> virus (FBJ-MSV) and Finkel-Biskis-Reilly murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> virus (FBR-MSV); c-jun has been transduced by the chicken avian <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> virus 17 (ASV17) retrovirus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using an in vitro degradation assay, we show that the mutated v-FosFBR, but not v-FosFBJ or v-JunASV17, is resistant to calpains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This property raises the interesting possibility that decreased sensitivity to calpains might contribute to the tumorigenic potential of FBR-MSV by allowing greater accumulation of the protein that it encodes in infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It has also been demonstrated that resistance to cleavage by calpains does not result from mutations that have accumulated in the Fos moiety of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein but rather from the addition of atypical <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> motifs at its both ends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This observation raises the interesting possibility that homologous regions in <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and cellular Fos either display slightly different conformations or are differentially accessible to interacting proteins </plain></SENT>
