<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> correspond to resting B cells, the LCLs resemble activated B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> which have the EBV genome are carried in vitro, they acquire some of the features of LCLs, such as expression of B-cell activation markers and the tendency to form aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison of several B-cell lines for sensitivity to TGF-beta showed that the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> (with few exceptions), but not of the LCLs, was inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that the sensitivity to TGF-beta correlates with the <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present work, this assumption is even more critically substantiated by studying 2 sublines of an EBV-genome carrying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line, Mutu, which were selected for single cells and aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The former (with resting phenotype) was inhibited, while the subline of aggregated cells, which also expressed B-cell activation markers, was not inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Somatic-cell hybrids between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>, LCLs and non-B cells provided lines with phenotypic differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results with a panel of such hybrid lines also showed that those which express the activated B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> are not inhibited by TGF-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences in the levels of expression of activation markers did not influence the response to TGF-beta </plain></SENT>
