<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated the pattern of distribution of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and also studied the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-association and p53 expression in 35 HIV-positive patients from India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biopsy samples were studied for histology and for expression of CD20, CD3, CD15, CD30, light chains, CD138, bcl-6, epithelial membrane antigen, EBV-latent membrane protein-1, and p53 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization was performed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi>-labeled anti-sense EBV-encoded nuclear <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-1 (EBER-1) probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on DNA extracted from paraffin sections for EBV-subtype analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 35 cases included 7 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), 4 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> (PL), and 24 cases of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the cases of NHL, 3 were Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), 4 were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLBL) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> type (CBL), 10 were DLBL of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> type (IBL), 4 were high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (unspecified) and the rest were other subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EBV-association was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, 2 of 3 BL, and 3 of 10 IBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PCR analysis of the EBNA-3C gene revealed amplimers corresponding to type A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A p53 protein overexpression was noted in 6 of 10 IBLs, 1 of 3 BLs, 2 of 3 CBLs, and 5 of 7 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first reported study of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in HIV-positive individuals from India </plain></SENT>
