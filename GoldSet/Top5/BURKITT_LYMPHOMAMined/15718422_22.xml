<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we reported that high AS expression did not correlate to L-asparaginase resistance in <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1-positive B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we confirmed this finding in <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1-positive patients (n = 28) using microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 35 L-asparaginase-resistant <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1-negative B-lineage ALL patients had a significant 3.5-fold higher AS expression than 43 sensitive patients (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTQ-PCR), this finding was confirmed in an independent group of 39 TEL-AML1-negative B-lineage ALL patients (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High expression of AS was associated with poor prognosis (4-year probability of disease-free survival [pDFS] 58% +/- 11%) compared with low expression (4-year pDFS 83% +/- 7%; P = .009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that resistance to l-asparaginase and relapse risk are associated with high expression of AS in <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1-negative but not <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1-positive B-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
