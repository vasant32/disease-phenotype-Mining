<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">arsenic trioxide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>, low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">arsenic trioxide</z:chebi> combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cell viability and proliferative curve were estimated by trypan blue dye exclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell cycle status were analyzed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> related elements such as caspase-3, BCL-2, BAX, JNK2 and IkappaB-alpha, were measured with Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that compared with cells treated with mentioned above drugs alone, the proliferative potential of cells in combination group was significantly inhibited (p &lt; 0.01), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate markedly increased (p = 0.001), while obvious cell cycle arrest was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the protein level, the expression of Caspase-3, BAX and IkappaB-alpha increased, while the expression of BCL-2, and JNK2 decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">arsenic trioxide</z:chebi> combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> synergistically induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Raji cell line which may be mediated by inhibiting NK-kappaB and JNK2 signaling </plain></SENT>
