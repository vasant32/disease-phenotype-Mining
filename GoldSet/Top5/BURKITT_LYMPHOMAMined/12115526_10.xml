<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The SH2 domain containing SH2D1A protein has been characterized in relation to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> (XLP), a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> that leads to serious clinical conditions after Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The SH2D1A gene is mutated in the majority of XLP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously detected SH2D1A in activated T and NK cells, but not in B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have found SH2D1A protein in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) lines, but only in those that carried EBV and had a Group I (germinal center) phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the EBV-carrying Group III (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e>) and the EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines tested were SH2D1A-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Motivated by these differences, we studied the impact of EBV and the <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> on SH2D1A expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We approached the former question with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> sublines after both the loss of the virus and subsequent reinfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also tested original EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines carrying transfected EBV genes, such as EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA6, EBER1, 2 and LMP1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our experiments, no direct relationship could be seen between EBV and SH2D1A expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We modified the phenotype of the Group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells by LMP1 transfection or CD40 ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic changes, indicated by expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> markers, e.g., SLAM, were accompanied by downregulation of SH2D1A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It seems, therefore, that the presence of EBV and the phenotype of the cell together regulate SH2D1A expression in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is possible that SH2D1A is expressed in a narrow window of B cell development represented by germinal center cells </plain></SENT>
