<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have isolated a cDNA clone for an interferon-induced 15-kDa protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cDNA clone was prepared from <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> isolated from interferon-beta-treated human Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clone of 635 base pairs contains an open reading frame coding for a protein of 145 amino acids, and suggests for the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> a 75-base pair 5' untranslated and a 125-base pair 3' untranslated region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Approximately 85% of the amino acid sequence of the 15-kDa protein has been independently obtained from 2 nmol of material using microsequencing technology on the N terminus of the intact protein and on tryptic and chymotryptic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amino acid sequence of the isolated protein is identical to the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis confirmed that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for the 15-kDa protein is undetectable in untreated cells, but is greatly induced following interferon treatment </plain></SENT>
