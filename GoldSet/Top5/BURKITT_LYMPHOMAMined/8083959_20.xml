<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the Arg-Gly repeat domain, R-337GQSRGRGRGRGRGRGKG354, results in EBV recombinants that transform primary B lymphocytes with modestly decreased activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The transformed cells grow slowly and are difficult to expand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EBNA-2 deleted for the Arg-Gly domain does not associate with the nuclear chromatin fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Arg-Gly repeat has an intrinsic ability to bind to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H1, to other proteins, including EBNA-1, and to nucleic acids, especially poly(G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two independent deletions of each part of the rest of region 3 (aa 359 to 383 and 385 to 430) have little effect on transformation, while deletion of the rest of region 3 (aa 361 to 425) as a single segment substantially reduces transformation efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>EBNA-2 deleted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of region 3 can still transactivate the LMP1 promoter in transient expression assays but is less active than EBNA-2 in transactivating the BamHI-C promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>EBNA-2 deleted for the Arg-Gly domain is better than EBNA-2 at transactivating the LMP1 promoter and is as active as EBNA-2 in transactivating the BamHI-C promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These data are most compatible with a model in which the Arg-Gly domain of region 3 is a modulator of EBNA-2 interactions and activities, while the rest of region 3 is important in positioning the region 2 J kappa binding domain relative to the region 4 acidic transactivating domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Despite the null phenotype of the region 3 deletion, region 3 is unlikely to mediate essential interactions with other proteins </plain></SENT>
