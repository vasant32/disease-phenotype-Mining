<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>Aggressiveness</z:hpo>, higher relapse rate, and treatment complications pose significant barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Decreased food intake and side effects of treatments make <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients vulnerable to deficiency of essential nutrients such as <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>, lysine, and proline leading to the formation of weak extra cellular matrix susceptible to easy breakdown by matrix metalloproteinase enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of these enzymes has shown promise in stopping <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aim: In this study, we investigated the effects of a specific nutrient mixture, containing <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi>, lysine, proline, green tea extract among others, in most aggressive forms of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> - Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> - using Raji and Jurkat cells respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methods: Nutrient mixture (NM) doses of 0, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000 microg/ml, were used to study effects on cell proliferation, expression of matrix metalloproteinase, Matrigel invasion and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: The results demonstrated that the dose response toxicity of the nutrient mixture on Raji cells gradually increased with increasing concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nutrient mixture was non-toxic to Jurkat cells, however exhibited anti-proliferative properties at higher concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Zymography demonstrated, NM had a significant inhibitory effect on matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression with total inhibition at 1000 microg/ml for Raji cells and at 500 microg/ml for Jurkat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The NM at 100 microg/ml completely inhibited Matrigel invasion for Raji cells, and at 1000 microg/ml for Jurkat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the NM challenge virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Raji and Jurkat cells exposed to 1000 microg/ml were in late <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Considering the lack of treatment options and continually increasing incidence, NM could be further explored for its therapeutic potential in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
