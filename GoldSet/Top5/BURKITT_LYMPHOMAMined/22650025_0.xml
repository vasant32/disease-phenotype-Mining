<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Raji, NB4 and K562 cells were treated in vitro with different concentrations of the extract from Marsdensia tenacissima, including different <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> elution components and C21 steroidal saponin monomer compounds, for different periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cell proliferation was measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> colorimetric assay and its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was determined by the flow cytometry (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Firstly, with higher concentrations, 100 microg/mL and 200 microg/mL, 70% <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> eluate from Marsdensia tenacissima inhibited the proliferation of Raji, NB4 and K562 cells significantly, in a dose and time dependent manner, compared with 30% and 50% <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> elution components from Marsdensia tenacissima (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondly, four C21 steroidal saponin monomer compounds, tenacissosides B,C,I and marsdenoside K, also inhibited the proliferation of Raji, NB4 and K562 cells in vitro significantly, in a dose and time dependent manner, compared with that of control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among them, tenacissoside C showed the strongest inhibition effects on proliferation of these cells under <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experimental conditions compared with the other three C21 steroidal saponin monomer compounds (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermor, the IC50 of tenacissosides C on proliferation of Raji, NB4 and K562 cells were 64.1 micromol/L, 70.4 micromol/L and 105.8 micromol/L, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, after Raji, NB4 and K562 cells were treated with 98.4 micromol/L tenacissoside C for 24 h and 48 h, the early <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rates and late <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rates of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells increased markedly, compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The extract from Marsdensia tenacissima, including different <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> elution components and C21 steroidal saponin monomer compounds, may inhibit the proliferation of some human hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> cell line cells and induce these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in vitro, especially tenacissoside C, one of the C21 steroidal saponin monomer compounds, showed the strongest effects on proliferation of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells when compared with other ones, with the strongest inhibition activities on human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji cells </plain></SENT>
