<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using PCR with degenerate primers and screening of a human B-cell lymphoblast cDNA library, a full-length cDNA encoding a 375-amino-acid protein was isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It contains seven regions of hydrophobic amino acids probably representing membrane-spanning domains of a novel heptahelix receptor, tentatively named CMKRL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It shows nearly 30% overall identity with the high-affinity IL8 receptor and similar degree of homology with other chemoattractant receptors, including the "fusin" coreceptors for HIV1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements of various transduction pathways following application of a panel of chemokines to transfected cells failed to evoke any reproducible response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the natural ligand for CMKRL2 could, thus, not be identified, receptor expression in spleen and lymph nodes as well as in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (irrespective of EBV status) supports a functional role in activated B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Receptor message was ubiquitously distributed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral tissues and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, suggesting that CMKRL2 is expressed in widespread cell populations, such as macrophages and neuroglia </plain></SENT>
