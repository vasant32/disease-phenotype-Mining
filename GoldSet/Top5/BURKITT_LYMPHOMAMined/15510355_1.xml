<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In this study, we sought to determine the occurrence of primary non-Hodgkins <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in the oral and maxillofacial region among Nigerians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied hospital records that included radiographs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of NHL in the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife, Nigeria, between January 1992 and December 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were expressed as mean +/- SD or number (%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 66 cases of NHL were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients had concomitant extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> involving the gastrointestinal tract, nasopharynx, skin, lungs, kidney, and thyroid, in descending order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients (4.5%) presented primarily with extranodal oral and maxillofacial disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ages of these patients ranged from 18 to 50 years (mean +/- SD, 32.3 +/- 16.3 years; median, 29 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the same period, there were 121 cases of Burkitts <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of lesions varied from 6 to 20 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients had intermediate-grade lesions; the remainder had low-grade lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two presented with stage II disease, and the remainder were stage I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients had chemotherapy with remission of their lesions but were followed up to 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most of them did not complete the treatment cycles due to financial and social constraints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rarity of primary NHL of oral and maxillofacial region has been aptly shown in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The need for the establishment of an effective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> policy with the active collaboration of voluntary agencies is emphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This would ensure ready availability of the required chemotherapeutic agents and hospital care at affordable costs </plain></SENT>
