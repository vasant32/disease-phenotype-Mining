<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A fundamental problem in studying the latent-to-lytic switch of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> lytic cycle itself is the lack of a culture system fully permissive to lytic cycle induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strategies to target EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> by inducing the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> lytic cycle with chemical agents are hindered by inefficient responses to stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro, even in the most susceptible cell lines, more than 50% of cells latently infected with EBV are refractory to induction of the lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying the refractory state are not understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We separated lytic from refractory Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived HH514-16 cells after treatment with an HDAC inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both refractory- and lytic-cell populations responded to the inducing stimulus by hyperacetylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, analysis of host cell gene expression showed that specific cellular transcripts Stat3, Fos, and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were preferentially upregulated in the refractory-cell population, while IL-6 was upregulated in the lytic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>STAT3 protein levels were also substantially increased in refractory cells relative to untreated or lytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This increase in de novo expression resulted primarily in unphosphorylated STAT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Examination of single cells revealed that high levels of STAT3 were strongly associated with the refractory state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The refractory state is manifest in a unique subpopulation of cells that exhibits different cellular responses than do lytic cells exposed to the same stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Identifying characteristics of cells refractory to lytic induction relative to cells that undergo lytic activation will be an important step in developing a better understanding of the regulation of the EBV latent to lytic switch </plain></SENT>
