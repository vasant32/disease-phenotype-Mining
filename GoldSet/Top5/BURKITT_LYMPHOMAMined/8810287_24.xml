<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increase both of Sp100 and PML <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is due to enhanced transcription of the corresponding genes which occurs independently of cellular protein synthesis immediately upon IFN-beta addition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the molecular cloning and functional analysis of the Sp100 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA sequence analysis revealed potential binding sites for several constitutive and IFN-inducible transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the absence of a TATA box and an initiator element, several transcription initiation sites were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transient expression studies identified an imperfect IFN-stimulated response element within the first 100 nucleotides upstream of the major transcription start site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This element rendered a heterologous promoter IFN-beta-inducible and bound IFN-stimulated gene factor 2 strongly but IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 only weakly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An IFN-gamma activation site approximately 500 base pairs upstream of the IFN-stimulated response element was found to bind three IFN-alpha/beta activation factors upon IFN-beta induction and conferred both type I and type II IFN inducibility upon a heterologous promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate a novel arrangement of a nonoverlapping IFN-gamma activation site and an IFN-stimulated response element mediating type I IFN inducibility, previously not reported for other IFN-stimulable promoters </plain></SENT>
