<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Res., 131:114-122, 1987), was shown to respond to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The m5s/1M cells showed high sensitivity to post-confluence inhibition of cell division and formed a uniform monolayer after the cells had become confluent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The addition of EGF resulted in loss of contact-dependent inhibition of growth and caused a massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001359'>piling</z:mp> up of a multilayered array of cells after they had become confluent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When EGF was removed from the medium, the cell number decreased rapidly, and the cells formed a uniform monolayer at the density observed in the absence of EGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>m5S/1M cells have high- and low-affinity receptors for EGF (approximately 40,000 receptors per cell), and the apparent dissociation constants of the EGF-binding reactions were 3.3 nM and 0.15 nM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of EGF on the intracellular mobilization of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> and the formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24846">inositol phosphates</z:chebi> was studied by using the calcium-sensitive fluorescent indicator fura 2 and [3H]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EGF had no effect either on the mobilization of cytosolic free calcium [( <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i) or on the formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24846">inositol phosphates</z:chebi> in m5s/1M cells, whereas bradykinin induced a rapid increase in both [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24846">inositol phosphates</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi> (GSL) composition of m5S/1M cells showed that globotriaosylceramide (Gb3Cer), which is known to be a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated antigen, is specifically expressed in the EGF-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression of Gb3Cer is dependent on the presence of EGF, with a reversible shift in GSL composition being observed in the presence or absence of EGF </plain></SENT>
