<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Six independently maintained sublines of FLEB 14, a fetal-liver-derived Epstein-Barr virus-transformed pro-B cell line that has not yet rearranged its immunoglobulin genes, were examined after in vitro propagation during 19-36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two lines showed no immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement, whereas one allele was rearranged with breakpoints inside the switch region of the mu chain gene in the remaining four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These rearrangements had been generated by the translocation of different chromosome fragments to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene cluster-carrying 14q32 band in each of the four lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously, a similar rearrangement was found in a fifth subline concurrently with a reciprocal 6;14 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The transposed pieces have been derived from chromosomes 16 and 18 in two of the more recently rearranged lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their origins could not be determined in the remaining two lines, but they were different from each other and the other three 14q+ markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 14q+ marker-carrying variant has replaced its diploid progenitor suggesting that the translocation has conveyed some in vitro growth advantage on its carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was also supported by the duplication of the 14q+ marker and the loss of its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 14 homologue in one subline during serial culturing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vulnerability of the switch region of the mu chain gene to illegitimate recombination at the pro-B stage and the possible relevance of this finding for the origin of the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated 8;14 (immunoglobulin heavy chain gene cluster/MYC) translocation is discussed </plain></SENT>
