<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed a rapid purification method for DNA topoisomerase I from Raji cells, a human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, using <z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> fractionation followed by chromatography on a Mono S column (FPLC, Pharmacia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By this method, the enzyme could be purified to near homogeneity within one day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electrophoresis on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel revealed that the final preparation is mainly composed of a 100-kDa protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major enzyme activity sedimented through a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> density gradient at 5.7S, accompanied with a minor peak at 8.7S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The former may correspond to the monomer of the 100-kDa <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>, and the latter, to its dimeric form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gel filtration study of the crude extract revealed an active molecular species of 200 kDa, in addition to 100 kDa, and lower molecular weight forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that DNA topoisomerase I is largely in monomeric form, but also has a minor population of the dimeric form </plain></SENT>
