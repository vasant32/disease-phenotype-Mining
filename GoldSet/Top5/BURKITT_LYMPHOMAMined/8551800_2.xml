<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of heat shock on polyadenylation in Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) negative and EBV transformed human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incubation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B-cell line P3HR-1, carrying the defective EBV genome [EBV nuclear antigen-2 gene deletion] at 46 degrees C for 15 min increased nuclear poly(A) polymerase (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, enzymatic activity declined and at 60 min it was reduced to about 50% of that observed in cells incubated at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no significant increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> activity was observed at 15 min or thereafter in an EBV- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line, ST-486, in response to elevated temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no heat shock mediated change in nuclear poly(A)-specific endonuclease activity was observed in either P3HR-1 or ST-486 cells suggesting a specific effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, thermal stress dependent increase in c-myc expression was detected only in P3HR-I cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest an association between EBV transformation and enhanced expression of c-myc and <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> activity </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of human B-cells with EBV is associated with their ability to respond to thermal stress by increased <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> activity which may stabilize <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> through enhanced polyadenylation </plain></SENT>
