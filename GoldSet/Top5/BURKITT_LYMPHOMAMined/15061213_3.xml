<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of AID was reported to be confined to the germinal center (GC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells are regarded as being derived from GC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells have been reported to have SHM in the Ig gene with variety in terms of degree, antigen selection and ongoing mutation characteristic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the expression of AID in 15 BL cell lines by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In only 2 BL cell lines, Tree92 and Black93, AID expression was not detected, and the 1gVH gene of these 2 cell lines was not mutated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tree92 expresses terminal deoxy-nucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and recombination activating gene (RAG)1, but Black93 does not, as is typical of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells are generally derived from GC B-cell expressing AID, but are rarely derived from the stage of B-lineage differentiation in which AID is not yet expressed, causing the absence of mutation in the IgVH </plain></SENT>
