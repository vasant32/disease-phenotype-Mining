<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cells from an established line of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Daudi) and a mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> (P(3)K) were pulse-labeled in vitro with (3)H-leucine, and immunoglobulin was immunologically precipitated from cell lysates and secretions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to P(3)K cells, Daudi cells synthesize a small amount of Ig which is not secreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subcellular fractionation experiments indicated that Ig of Daudi cells is synthesized on membrane-bound polyribosomes and enters the cisternae of the microsomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ig in the microsomes could be labeled with either (3)H-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> or (3)H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33984">fucose</z:chebi> suggesting that transport proceeds to the Golgi complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional evidence indicates that Ig molecules are transported to the plasma membrane but are not cleaved from the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results together with other studies of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells suggest that the Daudi line may represent a clone of neoplastic cells derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes which synthesize but do not secrete Ig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarities between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and antigen-binding cells are discussed </plain></SENT>
