<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) is a readily treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, recurrences, as well as disease arising in immunosuppressed patients, are notoriously resistant to conventional therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EBV is associated with a significant proportion of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that evade immune surveillance through decreased expression of both <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and cellular antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increasing the immunogenicity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells may, therefore, represent a potentially beneficial therapeutic maneuver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using in vitro models of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines, we demonstrate increased expression of genes coding for HLA class I and EBV latent proteins by the differentiation inducer phenylbutyrate (PB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aromatic fatty acid also caused cytostasis associated with sustained declines in c-myc expression, a direct antitumor effect that was independent of the EBV status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude, therefore, that differentiation therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> with PB may lead to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> immunogenicity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings may have clinical relevance because the in vitro activity has been observed with PB concentrations that are well tolerated and nonimmunosuppressive in humans, a desirable feature for the different patient populations afflicted with this disease </plain></SENT>
