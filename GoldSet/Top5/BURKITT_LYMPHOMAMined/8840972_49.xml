<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the maximum induction of Bcl-2 by LMP1 takes about 48-72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show in this report that up-regulation of the Bcl-2 homologue Mcl-1 by LMP1 preceded the induction of Bcl-2 and that the up-regulation was transient; therefore, Mcl-1 levels decreased when Bcl-2 levels started to increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This finding supports the hypothesis that Mcl-1 functions as a rapidly inducible, short-term effector of cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LMP1 also blocked the decline in the Mcl-1 levels in response to apoptotic stimulation triggered by elevated cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect of LMP1 was associated with a delayed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the EBV-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BL41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maintenance of Mcl-1 expression by LMP1 is likely to be a crucial immediate-early response that enables cells to survive until Bcl-2 can be up-regulated </plain></SENT>
