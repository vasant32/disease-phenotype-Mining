<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In immunofluorescence assay, this antibody reacted with myelomonocytes, EBV-B cells, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but not with erythroid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The surface antigen on U937 cells recognized by NI-58 had a molecular size of 65 kDa as determined by immunoblotting analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a biological function, NI-58 strongly inhibited the homotypic cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of LPS-stimulated U937 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that the antigen defined by NI-58 was distinct from CD54 (intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1) in it's pattern of cellular expression and molecular weight, suggesting that NI-58 recognizes a new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule and inhibits the homotypic cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of LPS-stimulated U937 cells </plain></SENT>
