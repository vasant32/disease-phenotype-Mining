<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Persistence of H-1 DNA rendered the cells resistant to a second H-1 infection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This resistance to H-1 superinfection persisted even after loss of H-1 DNA occurring after approximately 150-200 cell generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resistance to H-1 superinfection was accompanied by reduced uptake of infectious particles and by a block of H-1 DNA replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that persistent H-1 infection leads to modifications of cellular functions involved in the permissivity for H-1 </plain></SENT>
