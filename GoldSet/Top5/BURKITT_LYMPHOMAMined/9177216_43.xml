<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CIITA is a positive regulator of class II major histocompatibility complex gene transcription that has been found to be defective in one of the five complementation groups of class II major histocompatibility complex-negative cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its N-terminal region is capable of activating transcription from a reporter gene when fused to a DNA binding domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the mechanism of transactivation mediated by the CIITA activation domain by studying its role in the process of transcription initiation and elongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically the altered specificity <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> (TATA box binding protein) assay has been used to analyze the response of the CIITA activation domain to mutations in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> known to disrupt its interaction with its associated general factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transactivation by CIITA was extremely sensitive to a mutation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> that in yeast is known to abolish <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP16</z:chebi>-mediated transcription but leaves basal transcription unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> mutant defective in interaction with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi>-associated factor TAFII250 also failed to mediate transactivation through the CIITA activation domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Certain interactions between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> and general factors that are specifically required for acidic activation domains were also required for CIITA-mediated transactivation to reach its full potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP16</z:chebi>, CIITA was able to stimulate elongation of transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall the mechanism of transactivation by the human B-cell-specific CIITA is very similar to that mediated by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e> virus transactivator <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP16</z:chebi> in the ways that have been tested </plain></SENT>
