<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a comparative study of populations at high and low risk of nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC), sera from 442 Eskimo and 770 Danish children and adolescents were tested for the presence of antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eskimo children in Greenland were seropositive at an early age and showed significantly higher titers of IgG antibody to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (VCA) (p less than 0.0001) and soluble (S) antigen (p less than 0.005) than Danes matched for age and sex, but had similar levels of IgA antibody to VCA and IgG antibody to the early antigen (EA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The high geometric mean VCA (IgG) titers found in certain age groups of Eskimo children were as high as those previously reported from areas in Africa highly endemic for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Greenland, neither location nor household size was a determining factor for prevalence or titer of VCA (IgG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The high antibody titers among Eskimo children probably reflect exposure to a large inoculum of EBV at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary infection</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> early in life and/or re-exposure due to the higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in Greenland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In view of the high incidence of NPC in Greenland and the known association of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> with EBV, we speculate that the time and quantitative aspects of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary infection</z:e> are also factors of relevance in the etiology of NPC </plain></SENT>
