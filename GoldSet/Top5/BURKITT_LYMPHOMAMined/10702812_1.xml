<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We have previously reported on a complex chromosome rearrangement [der(17)] in a B-cell line, BRG A, established from an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patient with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was the definition of der(17) composition and the identification of complete or partial chromosome gains and losses in two cell clones (BRG A and BRG M) derived from this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We applied comparative genome hybridization (CGH) to detect the DNA misrepresentations in the genome of the two cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Findings from CGH and banding analysis could then direct the choice of probes for chromosome painting experiments to elucidate der(17) composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CGH analysis identified gains of chromosomes 1q, 7q, 12q, 13q, 15q, 17p, 20p,q and losses of chromosomes 3p and 5q in BRG A and gain of chromosome 1q and loss in chromosome 6q in BRG M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some of the detected alterations had already been described in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, while others appeared to be new </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of these techniques allowed a precise definition of der(17), composed by translocated regions from chromosomes 12 and 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated CGH to be a powerful tool in the identification of recurrent chromosome aberrations in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and in ascertaining the origin of marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We were also able to identify a different pattern of aberrations and assess an independent sequence of events leading to the 1p gain in the two subclones </plain></SENT>
