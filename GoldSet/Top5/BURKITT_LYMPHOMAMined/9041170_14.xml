<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) after treatment with epipodophyllotoxins is being observed with increased frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic options are limited for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> and the role of bone marrow transplantation is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors report the treatment outcome of a cohort of 17 children who developed epipodophyllotoxin-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> after therapy for childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) that included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> but no irradiation or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (76%) had 11q23 chromosomal abnormalities that were not present at the initial diagnosis of ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Remission induction was attempted in 16 children, with 13 (81%) achieving a complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After consolidation, 9 of these 13 patients received a bone marrow transplant (BMT): 2 with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide-purged autologous marrow, 4 from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling, 1 from a mismatched parental donor, and 2 from a matched unrelated donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One additional child underwent allogeneic BMT without an attempt at reinduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 patients who received transplants, 2 were alive and well 27+ and 36+ months, respectively, after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 7 patients who did not receive a transplant, at last follow-up 1 had survived off therapy for 8 months for recurrent ALL whereas 6 died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the poor prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> after epipodophyllotoxin treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> can achieve a remission, it is usually of brief duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic BMT may offer the possibility of long term remission in some of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More information is needed to better define the risks and benefits of epipodophyllotoxin therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
