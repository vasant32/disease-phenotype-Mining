<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 34 mo with 43% alive at 70 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with a poor prognosis include: male sex, constitutional symptoms, advanced stage, bone marrow involvement, huge (greater than 10 cm) abdominal masses with gastrointestinal involvement, hepatic involvement, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> greater than 12 g/dl, or serum LDH greater than 250 U </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The best prediction of a given patient's survival was defined by a set of four variables, which includes sex, symptoms, bone marrow status, and the presence or absence of a huge abdominal mass with gastrointestinal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, classification of these patients according to the histopathologic categories of Rappaport of Strauchen did not define patient groups with significant differences in survival, nor did these categories correlate with the previously described clinical factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the distribution of these prognostic factors in any clinical trial is needed before therapeutic results can be compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, such data may define subsets of patients for whom current therapy is inadequate and conversely those patients for whom current therapy yields excellent long-term survival </plain></SENT>
