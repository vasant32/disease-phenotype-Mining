<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both breasts were involved and the resected tissue showed starry sky macrophages and a proliferation of lymphoblasts containing <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nucleus of the lymphoblast was oval or indented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic cells examined expressed TdT, CD10, CD14, CD38, and WH14 (a marker of pre-B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Southern blotting analysis showed a rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and germline configurations of T-cell receptor gene and c-myc 3rd exon gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotype and genotype of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> were different from those of previously reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>, but identical to those of B-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case, therefore, was regarded as B-cell type lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> containing <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplets </plain></SENT>
