<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> after administration of rituximab have only been reported as case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have analysed retrospectively the change of platelet counts following the administration of rituximab in 253 patients with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlations with clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mean overall decrease in platelets was observed after rituximab infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A downward trend in platelet count of more than 30% was observed in 7.2% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decline was observed when rituximab was given as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk factors to develop a decline in platelets after infusion of rituximab were pre-existent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> stage, bone marrow infiltration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, leukemic presentation, and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a decline in platelet count after administration of rituximab was observed in patients with NHL, mainly those with pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
