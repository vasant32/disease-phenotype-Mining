<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four promoters, Cp, Wp, Qp, and Fp, are known to drive EBNA1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the TATA-less Qp is constitutively active in a variety of EBV-positive [EBV(+)] <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and cell lines, irrespective of the activities of other EBNA1 promoters, the type of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latency, and the cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transcription of highly regulated promoters such as the EBV Cp is known to be directly regulated by CpG methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To characterize the role of CpG methylation in the regulation of the constitutively active Qp, we performed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> genomic sequencing and functional analyses using a methylation cassette transcriptional reporter assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty consecutive CpG sites (16 proximal to the Qp initiation site and 4 upstream of the adjacent Fp initiation site) were studied by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing of DNA extracted from EBV(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen EBV(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of lymphoid (B, T, and NK cell) or epithelial origin and five Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 16 CpG sites proximal to Qp were virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> unmethylated, but the 4 CpG sites upstream of the Fp initiation site were variably methylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The methylation cassette assay showed that in vitro methylation of the Qp cassette (-172 to +32) resulted in strong repression of Qp activity in transient transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, Qp is susceptible to repression by methylation but was found to be consistently hypomethylated and expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-derived cell lines studied </plain></SENT>
