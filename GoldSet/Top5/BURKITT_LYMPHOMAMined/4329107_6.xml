<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell cultures derived from three types of leukocytes were examined: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> extracts were analyzed for total <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> weight, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, neutral <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Distribution of individual <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> was determined by quantitative two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (51-54%) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> (24-25%), with smaller amounts of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three types of cultured cells showed a remarkable similarity in total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> content (17-18 x 10(-15) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027962,C0027960" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">moles</z:e>/cell) as well as in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More variation was seen in neutral <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">Glycolipid</z:chebi> was abundant (17-23% of total <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> weight) and was present mostly as <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> dihexoside </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes or polymorphonuclear leukocytes, the cultured cells showed increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi>, decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelin</z:chebi>, and decreased cholesterol content, similar to the changes found in leukemic leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the altered <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> patterns found in leukemic leukocytes are a reflection of cell immaturity rather than a characteristic peculiar to the leukemic state </plain></SENT>
