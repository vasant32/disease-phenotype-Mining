<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proposed trials of preventive measures for both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> are receiving serious consideration as possible means of establishing a causal relationship with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper we examine certain models for the interaction of EBV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> in the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, and also review the aims of the longitudinal, population-based study being conducted in the West Nile District of Uganda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given existing knowledge, the outcome of preventive trials, even for the most simple interaction models, is unpredictable and, under certain circumstances, trials of an EBV vaccine could actually increase the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that trials of an EBV vaccine at this time would be premature and should be delayed at least until the results from the West Nile prospective study are clear </plain></SENT>
