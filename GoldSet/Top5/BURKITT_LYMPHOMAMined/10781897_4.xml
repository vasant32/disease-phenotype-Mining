<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The functions of a small <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-binding protein, Rho, in human leukemic cell invasion was investigated in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human leukemic KM3 and Reh cells (derived from B-cell-type common <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemias</z:hpo>) were inoculated into severe combined immundeficiency (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alteration of invasion in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice inoculated with KM3 cells that were introduced with the expression vector for Rho Val14 (Rho V14), an activated mutant form of Rho, was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice inoculated with KM3 and Reh cells developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> 21 days after inoculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> died by day 26-27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The leukemic cells were localized to bone marrow and around the spinal cord, with no infiltration into peripheral blood, spleen, liver, thymus, or lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice inoculated with Rho V14-transfected KM3 cells showed a 5-day reduction in the time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice inoculated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24753">hygromycin</z:chebi>-resistance gene-transfected KM3 (hyg(r)) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the mice inoculated with Rho V14 cells showed leukemic cell infiltration, not only into bone marrow and around the spinal cord but also into peripheral blood, liver, and spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no in vitro or in vivo differences in growth rates of Rho V14 and hyg(r) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the Rho V14 cells showed markedly increased cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> compared to the hyg(r) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results suggest that Rho activation accelerates human leukemic cell invasion via augmentation of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
