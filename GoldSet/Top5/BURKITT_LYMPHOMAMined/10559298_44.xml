<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Initiation of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic cycle is controlled by two immediate-early genes, BZLF1 and BRLF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In certain epithelial and B-cell lines, their protein products, ZEBRA and Rta, stimulate their own expression, reciprocally stimulate each other's expression, and activate downstream <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been difficult to examine the individual roles of these two transactivators in EBV-infected lymphocytes, as they are expressed simultaneously upon induction of the lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji represents an experimental system that allows the study of Rta's role in the lytic cycle of EBV in the absence and presence of ZEBRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When expressed in Raji cells, exogenous Rta does not activate endogenous BZLF1 expression, yet Rta remains competent to transactivate certain downstream <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some genes, such as BaRF1, BMLF1, and a late gene, BLRF2, are maximally activated by Rta itself in the absence of detectable ZEBRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of the Z(S186A) mutant form of ZEBRA, whose transactivation function is manifest only by coexpression of Rta, allows identification of a second class of lytic cycle genes, such as BMRF1 and BHRF1, that are activated in synergy by Rta and ZEBRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It has already been documented that of the two activators, only ZEBRA stimulates the BRLF1 gene in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is a third class of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes activated by ZEBRA but not Rta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ZEBRA exhibits an inhibitory effect on Rta's capacity to stimulate the late gene, BLRF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently ZEBRA may function to repress Rta's potential to activate some late genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Raji cells thus allow delineation of the combinatorial roles of Rta and ZEBRA in control of several distinct classes of lytic cycle genes </plain></SENT>
