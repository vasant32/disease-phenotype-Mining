<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the 15 tumors had one or more clonal mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty one mutations were found in the second exon; only one occurred in the third exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had mutations that clustered in a region spanning amino acids 38-63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of these possessed mutations that altered prolines at positions 57 (3), 60 (1), and 63 (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were mutated in the central portions of the second exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These occurred at position 95 (2), position 115 (2), position 137 (1), and position 138 (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the published sequences from five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> showed a similar clustering of mutations, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six having mutations in codons between positions 38-63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The regions where mutations occurred have been associated with a variety of properties, including transcriptional activation and cellular transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number and location of mutations showed no correlation with either chromosome 8 or chromosome 14 breakpoints or with the Epstein-Barr virus positivity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This unexpected, frequent occurrence of clustered mutations in the second exon of the MYC gene suggests a role for the mutated MYC proteins in the pathogenesis of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, possibly through altered interactions of this domain with other cellular factors </plain></SENT>
