<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination of periradicular tissues from extracted tooth (85), confirmed the diagnosis of early periradicular B urkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Case 2, is a 6-year-old boy who presented with one-week history of a loose, extruded right mandibular first molar tooth (46) and an exfoliated left mandibular first molar tooth (36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After two weeks of follow-up, the patient developed bilateral mandibular swelling at the molar region, as well as peri-orbital and bilateral pedal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incisional biopsy of the oral lesion at the region of exfoliated left first mandibular molar (36) was useful for histopathological diagnosis of early Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the jaw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the face of limited diagnostic tools such as clinico-radiological assessment, cytology or incisional biopsy for incipient periradicular lesions, a high index of suspicion of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the jaw may be helpful in early diagnosis and treatment of a lesion, presenting in a child as periradicular radiolucency or mixed radiolucency and radiopacity, with associated loosening and displacement of teeth </plain></SENT>
