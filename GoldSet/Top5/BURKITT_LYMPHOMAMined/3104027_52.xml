<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Ia antigen-associated invariant chain (In) exists in humans as four related <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi>, p33, p35, p41 and p43, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with HLA-class II antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As described previously, two of these forms of In chain, p33 and p35, result from the use of two in-phase initiation AUG codons on the unique In p33 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to cDNA clones derived from In p33 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, we have isolated a new cDNA clone, called p41-1, which differs from p33-1 by an additional segment in the coding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DNA sequence encoding the segment unique to p41-1 was identified in the genomic sequence in the intron between exon 6 and 7, and we refer to it as exon 6b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells transfected with a full length p41 cDNA clone in an expression vector synthesize the two larger forms of the In chain, p41 and p43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose that the larger <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, encoding p41, results from alternative splicing of exon 6b, and that p41 and p43 result from the use of the two functional initiation AUG codons identified in p33 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alternative splicing, together with alternative initiation of translation, allows therefore the synthesis of four related In chain <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> from a single gene </plain></SENT>
