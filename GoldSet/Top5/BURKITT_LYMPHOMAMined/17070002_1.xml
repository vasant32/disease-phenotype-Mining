<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the northeast region of Brazil its latex is used as an antimicrobial, antiparasitic in the treatment of coughs, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatism</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and other maladies as folk remedy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present work concerns its developmental toxicity in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats on the first day post-coitum (dpc) were grouped as control (distilled water) and treated (latex aqueous solution) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were treated by oral gavage from the 1st to the 4th (Experiment I) and from the 5th to 7th dpc (Experiment II) and killed on the 5th or 14th dpc, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maternal variables were: clinical signs of toxicity, body weight, ovaries, liver and kidneys weight and number of corpora lutea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The uterine tubes and cornua were washed for counting and identification of embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The embryos and placenta were weighed </plain></SENT>
