<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An important role for EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in eliminating virus-infected cells is well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Limited studies using a small number of immune donors have defined target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> within the latent antigens of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study provides an extensive analysis of the distribution of class I-restricted CTL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> within EBV-encoded proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using recombinant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042214" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vaccinia</z:e> encoding individual EBV latent antigens (Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen [EBNA] 1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, LP, and LMP 1), we have successfully localized target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> recognized by CTL clones from a panel of 14 EBV-immune donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 20 CTL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> localized, five were defined at the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although CTL clones specific for nine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> recognized both type 1 and type 2 transformants, a significant number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> (7/16 epitopes for which EBV type specificity was determined) were detected only on type 1 EBV transformants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042214" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vaccinia</z:e> recombinants encoding EBNA 3A and EBNA 3C were recognized more frequently than any other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042214" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vaccinia</z:e> recombinants used in this study, while no CTL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> were localized in EBNA 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> specificity for a large number of EBV-specific CTL clones could not be localized, although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042214" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vaccinia</z:e> recombinants used in this study encoded most of the latent antigens of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that any EBV vaccine based on CTL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> designed to provide widespread protection will need to include not only latent antigen sequences but also other regions of the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The apparent inability of human CTLs to recognize EBNA 1 as a target antigen, often the only latent antigen expressed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, suggests that EBV-specific CTL control of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> will not be feasible unless the down-regulation of latent antigens can be reversed </plain></SENT>
