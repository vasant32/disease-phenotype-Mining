<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation of nuclear extracts obtained from HeLa cells labelled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>-methionine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>-orthophosphate followed by gel electrophoresis of the precipitate revealed a major band of 90 kd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This antigen, called pp90, was judged to be responsible for the nucleolar fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serine residues were predominantly phosphorylated in pp90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar nucleolar fluorescence was observed commonly in human cells derived from <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo>, adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and in 5 lymphoid cells derived from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human lymphocytes or liver cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In immunoprecipitation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>-labelled pp90 was commonly detected as the major component in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of those cells which showed nucleolar fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Resting human embryo lung (HEL) cells were negative for both nucleolar fluorescence and pp90 in immunoprecipitation, but turned positive when stimulated to grow, suggesting the involvement of pp90 in cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antigen pp90 was also induced in human lymphocytes and HEL cells by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with Epstein-Barr virus in human cytomegalovirus, respectively, which are known to induce cell DNA synthesis in early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A cross-reacting nucleolar antigen was detected in 2 monkey cells but not in 3 rodent cells tested </plain></SENT>
