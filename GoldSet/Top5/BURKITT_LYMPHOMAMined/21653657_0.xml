<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a review of 1682 cases of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosed in the First Affiliated Hospital and Zhongshan School of Medicine, from 1998 to 2010, 20 cases (1.2%) of sBL were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation were used to analyse the clinicopathological features of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 20 cases of sBL, 18 patients were male and two were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 18 years (range 2-67 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extranodal presentation was more common than nodal presentation (55% vs 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathologically, 18 cases (90%) showed monotonous medium-sized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells, and two cases showed cells that were slightly pleomorphic in nuclear size and shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypically, MUM1 was positive in three of 17 cases (17.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EBER expression was shown in five of 17 cases (29.4%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBER-positive sBLs were Bcl-6+/MUM1- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: sBL is rare and mainly affects male children, with predominantly extranodal presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MUM1 expression was found in some sBLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EBER expression was found in 29.4% of sBLs from southern China, an area with a well-known high incidence of nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, which is closely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epstein-Barr virus infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
