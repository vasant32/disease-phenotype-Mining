<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The morphologic criteria for the two variants of small noncleaved follicular center cell (SNC FCC) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the Lukes-Collins classification, Burkitt's (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and non-Burkitt's variants (NBL), were evaluated and related to the results of multiparameter laboratory and clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients were studied: 25 cases were classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen cases were classified as NBL on the basis of greater variability in nuclear size and shape, more prominent nucleoli, and greater variation in the amount of cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic follicles were present in three cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and two of NBL, indicating an FCC origin for this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic examination confirmed the light microscopic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin (Ig) monoclonality, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence (surface Ig) and/or immunoperoxidase staining for cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (CIg), was demonstrated in 21 of 24 (87.5%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and 13 of 16 (71%) of NBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinically, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> presented more frequently in extranodal sites and with gastrointestinal involvement than NBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow involvement was more common in NBL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both groups had advanced stage disease at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 10.5 months in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and 7.7 months in NBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and NBL are biologically related variants of SNC FCC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but have different presentations, which may be clinically significant </plain></SENT>
