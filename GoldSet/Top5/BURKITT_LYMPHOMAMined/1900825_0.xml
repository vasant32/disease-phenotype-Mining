<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An antigen with a molecular weight of 150 kilodaltons expressed on certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was recognized by a human monoclonal antibody (3H12), which had been established by the fusion of lymphocytes from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149925" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="SCLC">small cell lung cancer</z:e> patient with a mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line (P3U1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 3 out of 4 cases with lymphoid crisis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) were positively stained by 3H12, while cells from 5 cases with myeloid crisis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> did not react to this antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibody did not show any reactivity to cells from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further examined 29 cell lines of hematopoietic origin and found that 2 undifferentiated cells (BV-173 and K-562) reacted to the 3H12 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that 3 out of 6 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (DAUDI, RAJI and HR1K) reacted to 3H12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that the antigen recognized by 3H12 is a differentiation-associated antigen expressed on immature lymphoid cells, and could potentially be a reliable cell lineage marker </plain></SENT>
