<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The biosynthesis of the HLA-A and -B antigens was studied in the B lymphoblastoid cell line BRI 8 and the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line DAudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The heavy chains of the HLA-A and -B antigens were inserted asymmetrically into the rough endoplasmic reticulum of BRI 8 cells as transmembrane <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the first 5 min after synthesis, the majority of the heavy chains became associated with beta 2-microglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At this stage, the heavy chains carried a high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> (core) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent processing of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> unit occurred during the next 20 to 25 min, resulting in the conversion of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> from the high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> to the complex form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>About 30 to 40 min after synthesis, the mature antigens were expressed at the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glycosylation was not required for asymmetric insertion, intracellular transport, or surface expression of the HLA-A and -B antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, studies with Daudi cells indicated that combination with beta 2-microglobulin was necessary for subsequent processing and intracellular transport of the heavy chains after their synthesis in the rough endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
