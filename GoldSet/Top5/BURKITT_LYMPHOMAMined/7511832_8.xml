<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies the authors were able to prove that this enzyme or an unknown homologous protein is localized also to the plasma membrane of B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In peripheral blood from healthy donors 11% of the mononuclear cells (PBMNC) expressed this surface antigen whereas in PBMNC of patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> 76% of the MNC were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This value correlates well with the known B-cell markers CD19 and CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, this antigen is different from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known clustered B-cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation analysis of PHA-stimulated PBMNC and of cells from patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> revealed a membrane protein with the same molecular weight (61 kDa) as the TPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that this enzyme is present not only in the cytoplasm but also on the surface of B cells and that it is possibly involved in the regulation of the SH-SS status of the cell membrane proteins of B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
