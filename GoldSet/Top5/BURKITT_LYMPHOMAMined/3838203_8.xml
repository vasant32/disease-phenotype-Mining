<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have now introduced the active c-myc oncogene of proliferating mouse spleen cells into human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells carrying the t(8;14) chromosome translocation by hydridization, and have examined the hybrids for expression of the human and murine c-myc oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of this analysis, reported here, indicate that the active mouse myc gene is shut off at the transcriptional level in the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, implying that human B cells at the stage of differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells used in this study are nonpermissive for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc transcription </plain></SENT>
