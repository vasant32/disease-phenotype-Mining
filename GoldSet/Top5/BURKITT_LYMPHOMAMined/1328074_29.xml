<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By contrast, isogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells which are phenotypically altered as a result of activation of their resident EBV genome (group-III cells) are highly protected from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic changes in group-III cells include the up-regulation of the oncogene, bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of the 26-kDa bcl-2 protein in group-I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells following gene transfer was found to afford protection from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>: the degree of protection was proportional to the amount of bcl-2 protein expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When group-I bcl-2 transfectants were compared with their group-III counterparts it was found that, whilst bcl-2 made a significant contribution in protecting from entry into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, hyper-expression of bcl-2 protein in group-I cells (well beyond that of group-III cells) was necessary to attain the high levels of protection observed in group-III cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that additional, bcl-2-independent, survival mechanisms could operate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In support of this notion it was also found that: (1) prolonged culture of group-I lines in vitro resulted in enhanced survival in the absence of bcl-2 up-regulation, and (2) exposure of group-I cells to interferon-alpha triggered a bcl-2-independent protective response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms of both the bcl-2-dependent and -independent survival pathways remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
