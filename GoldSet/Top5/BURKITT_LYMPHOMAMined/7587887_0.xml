<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the presence of pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> (PWM), human LAK cells induced DNA fragmentation of two leukemic cell lines (U937 cells and Raji cells) and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> cell lines (SW1116 cells and Hep-2 cells), a hallmark of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reactions were carried out at the effector/target ratio of 1:1 and in 4 hr coculture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48001">protein synthesis inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi>) did not prevent the target cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the TNF-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines such as SW1116 cells and Raji cells were also triggered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, other factors than TNF would play the role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA-PI staining FACS analysis also suggested that a part of LAK cells underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> to some extent during incubation with target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results provide a new way to investigate the mechanisms of cytotoxicity of LAK cells and to enhance the efficacy of adoptive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> therapy with LAK cells </plain></SENT>
