<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Orbito-ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> are important causes of ophthalmic morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various reports have shown that they occur more commonly among Africans than Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this era of HIV pandemic, an increase in the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related orbito-ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> has also been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to determine the pattern of orbito-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015414" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ocular tumours</z:e> in Enugu, South-Eastern Nigeria and to compare it with the findings from earlier studies in the same area, other parts of Nigeria and other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a retrospective, non-comparative case series study the records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases of orbito-ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> seen in the Histopathology departments of the two tertiary multidisciplinary hospitals with major eye clinics in Enugu (ParkLane Specialist and University of Nigeria Teaching Hospitals) between January 2001 and August 2005 were analysed for types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, frequency of occurrence, sex and age of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 43 cases were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 17 males and 26 females (M: F-l:1.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>Retinoblastoma</z:hpo> was the most commonly occurring <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> accounting for 25.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>; followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the conjunctiva which was seen in 5 (11.6%) of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Squamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papilloma</z:mpath> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> each accounting for 9.3% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> in the series were the third most commonly occurring ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In spite of the limitations of the study our findings suggest that the spectrum of orbito-ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> has generally remained the same in Enugu, South-Eastern Nigeria as well as in other parts of the country </plain></SENT>
