<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite a variety of therapeutical approaches including high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> treatment with subsequent autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, as well as vaccination, cures remain rare exceptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An important issue for future immunological treatments is the identification and characterization of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated antigens in MM is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PBK/TOPK and activated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17822">serin</z:chebi> kinase 2 (PAK2) are novel <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17822">serin</z:chebi> kinases that have recently been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PBK/TOPK is overexpressed in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, and MM; PAK2 is expressed in malignant lymphatic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cyclin kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) is overexpressed in MM compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We hereby identified and characterized for the first time HLA-class-I-restricted immunogenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in the amino acid sequences of PAK2 and CDKN1A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using two independent prediction algorithms, we identified two <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in PAK2 and three <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in CDK1NA with high binding to HLA-A2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using an IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay, we could demonstrate the presence and functional activity of CD8-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-specific T cells with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To show HLA-A2-restricted antigen recognition, the specific inhibition of T cell recognition was demonstrated with an anti-HLA-A2-blocking antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By analysis of peripheral blood of 34 healthy donors for the presence and functional activity of CD8 T cells specific for these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, we could demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> T-cell precursors specifically recognizing at least one of the tested <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> are present in 50-60% of the tested donors and that these T-cell precursors can be expanded in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that PAK2- and CDKN1A-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> can elicit a strong and consistent CD8 T-cell response in an in vitro model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further investigations will examine the presence and functionality of such T cells in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing host </plain></SENT>
