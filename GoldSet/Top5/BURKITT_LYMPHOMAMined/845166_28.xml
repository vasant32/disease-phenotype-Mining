<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A method has been developed for the rapid large scale isolation of plasma membranes and intact nuclei from RAJI lymphoid cells utilizing hypotonic lysis of cells after intracellular loading with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> followed by combined flotation-sedimentation within a discontinuous <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nuclei may be isolated in about 1 h and plasma membranes in about 6 h from 1 to 20 g of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intact nuclei, obtained in 90 to 95% yield based on lysed cells, was isolated by differential centrifugation and contained 16% DNA and about 30% of total cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A crude plasma membrane fraction was isolated by centrifugation onto a cushion of 38% <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> (d 1.1683) and subsequently resolved into two subfractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The less dense vesicles had an average d 1.127 and showed a 7-fold increase in specific activity for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> phosphodiesterase while the more dense (d 1.151) had a 20-fold concentration of enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activity of enzymes indicative of contamination with lysosomes, microsomes, mitochondria, and cytoplasm was negligible in these plasma membrane fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The less dense vesicles had a cholesterol:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> ratio of 0.97 which was higher than that of the more dense vesicles (0.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, the analytical values for the two types of membrane vesicles were similar as both fractions contained like percentages of protein (approximately 30%), <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> (approximately 30%), and carbohydrate (approximately 15%) with trace amounts of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five per cent of the total cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> was in the plasma membrane fractions </plain></SENT>
