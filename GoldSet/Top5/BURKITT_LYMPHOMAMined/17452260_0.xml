<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic karyotype showed an isochromosome 7q, i(7)(q10), as well as questionable rearrangements on 9p and 11q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies on both interphase and metaphase cells using the MLL "break-apart" and the centromeric chromosome 4 probes were instrumental in the characterization of an MLL gene rearrangement, which was cryptic by conventional cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the FISH pattern was consistent with an insertion of the 5' region of the MLL gene into chromosome 4 at band q21, most likely a variant t(4;11)(q21;q23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the second case of FISH detection of an ins(4;11) in ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our case exemplifies the importance of FISH in the further characterization of precursor B-cell ALL cases without any apparent prognostically significant chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
