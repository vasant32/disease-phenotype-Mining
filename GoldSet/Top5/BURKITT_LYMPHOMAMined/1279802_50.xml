<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal antibody that recognized a tyrosine-phosphorylated cell surface protein that was present in activated B cells was generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amino acid sequence analysis showed that this 140-kilodalton protein was CD22, a B cell-specific cell surface <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> and putative extracellular ligand of the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22 may be important in B cell signal transduction, possibly through regulation of the adhesiveness of activated B cells </plain></SENT>
