<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its association with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo>, nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and certain cases of Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently this virus has been found to be associated with gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies on this association, in our country are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have studied 37 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> using immunohistochemistry for LMP1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most workers have found an expression of latency type I antigens in <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, with only a few cases being LMP1 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 37 cases studied by us, 24.14% of cases were positive for LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LMP1 is known to have oncogenic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, it has been demonstrated earlier that the EBV particles in gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> are monoclonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These two factors support a pathogenetic role for EBV in gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
