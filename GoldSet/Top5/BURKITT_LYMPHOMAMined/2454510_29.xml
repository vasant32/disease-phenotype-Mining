<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This binding site is mutated in five out of seven Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> sequenced to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the protein-recognition region in greater detail, the abnormal c-myc allele from a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line (PA682) that carries a t(8;22) chromosomal translocation was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A point mutation in the binding region of the PA682 c-myc DNA abolished binding of this nuclear protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This protein may be an important factor for control of c-myc expression, and mutations in its recognition sequence may be associated with c-myc activation in many cases of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
