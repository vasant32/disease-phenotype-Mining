<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immunological marker analysis was performed in ten laboratories, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members of the Dutch Study Group on Immunophenotyping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphomas</z:hpo> (SI-HON) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Undifferentiated blasts were found in four patients, 67 had B-lineage ALL, 18 had T-lineage ALL, and two had biphenotypic ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age of T-lineage ALL patients was lower (mean 29.3) than that of B-lineage ALL patients (mean 35.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> mass, as expressed by leukocyte count, organomegaly, and LDH, was more pronounced in T-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> and platelet count was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (sub)types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD34 was expressed in 58% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, but most frequently in the common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> (70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen percent of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> expressed one or more markers not associated with their lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this prospective study immunological data were not evaluable for 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On four of them data were not available because of dry tap, for six patients the typing was technically insufficient, and for four patients the results were unclassifiable; with one patient the marker analysis was not performed </plain></SENT>
