<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Constitutive expression of c-myc resulting from a chromosomal translocation, which juxtaposes c-myc to an immunoglobulin gene, is a pivotal lesion in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This deregulated expression of c-myc is associated with mutations in the regulatory regions, i.e. the first exon and the first intron of c-myc in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> where the chromosomal breakpoint is not itself within the regulatory region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until recently it was widely believed that the c-myc protein in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that in a fraction of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from Africa and from the continental USA, and in mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo>, the c-myc gene carries mutations in the coding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We now show that, occasionally, such mutations are also present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myelomas</z:hpo>--<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> which do not carry translocations or amplifications of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also show that the frequency of the c-myc coding region mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> is independent of the frequency of mutations in the regulatory region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the mechanisms that induce missense mutations involving the coding region of c-myc may be different from those that lead to mutations in the regulatory regions </plain></SENT>
