<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have assayed the oncogenic, proliferative, and apoptotic activities of the frequent mutations that occur in the c-myc gene in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some alleles have a modest (50 to 60%) increase in transforming activity; however, the most frequent Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> allele (T58I) had an unexpected substantial decrease in transforming activity (85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> alleles restored the proliferation function of c-Myc in cells that grow slowly due to a c-myc knockout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was discordance for some alleles between apoptotic and oncogenic activities, but only the T58A allele had elevated transforming activity with a concomitant reduced apoptotic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We discovered a novel missense mutation, MycS71F, that had a very low apoptotic activity compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Myc, yet this mutation has never been found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, suggesting that there is no strong selection for antiapoptotic c-Myc alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MycS71F also induced very low levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release from mitochondria, suggesting a mechanism of action for this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phosphopeptide mapping provided a biochemical basis for the dramatically different biological activities of the transformation-defective T58I and transformation-enhanced T58A c-Myc alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the antiapoptotic survival factor insulin-like growth factor 1 was found to suppress phosphorylation of T58, suggesting that the c-Myc transactivation domain is a direct target of survival signals </plain></SENT>
