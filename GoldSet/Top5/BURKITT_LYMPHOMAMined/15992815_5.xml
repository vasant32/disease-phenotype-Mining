<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We established an IgA monoclonal antibody (mAb) against Shiga toxin 1 B subunits (Stx1B) from mouse nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALT) of BALB/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have developed an improved protocol in which cross-linked Stx1B is intranasally administered together with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cholera</z:e> toxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surface IgA-positive NALT lymphocytes from mice immunized in this manner were enriched and then fused with mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells to produce hybridoma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hybridoma culture supernatants were examined to see if they contain IgA against Stx1B and if they can inhibit carbohydrate recognition by Stx1B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the latter purpose, we prepared carbohydrate ligands in which globotriose is present on the poly-lysine backbone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The established IgA mAb exhibited saturable and dose-dependent binding to the immobilized Stx1B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inversely, the binding of the carbohydrate ligands to the immobilized Stx1B was inhibited by the mAb pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting and <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE analysis revealed dimeric IgA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IgA mAb inhibited the binding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi>-conjugated Stx1B to natural ligands displayed on a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Ramos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that surface IgA-positive B cells in the inductive sites of the mucosal immune system in the upper respiratory tract are a potent source for producing IgA mAb against protein antigens with weak immunogenicity such as Stx1B </plain></SENT>
