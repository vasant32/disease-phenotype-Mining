<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During continual cultivation after HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, the culture became resistant to interferons (IFNs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This resistant cell line, coded as H-903, was used as host cells for replication of GB virus C (GBV-C), also known as <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> G virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GBV-C <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was detected in the culture by reverse transcription-PCR for more than 130 days after inoculation, while it was detected for 44 days but not later in the parental IFN-sensitive Daudi cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> E2 antigen was detected by immunofluorescence in the cells inoculated with the fifth passage of GBV-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presumed capsid-coding region of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome in the inoculum, in the serially passaged virus, or in the virus produced by a long-term culture was only 16 amino acids long, suggesting that the GBV-C with a short core sequence was replication competent </plain></SENT>
