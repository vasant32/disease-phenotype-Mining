<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the authors' institution, 41 children (30 boys and 11 girls) have been treated who had intraabdominal Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A study was undertaken to assess the limitations of surgery in the treatment of intraabdominal Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An uniform policy was made to resect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> if possible or to debulk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> irrespective of the spread of disease, and if this was not possible to perform only a biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine children had laparotomy and various operative procedures, and in 2 children no laparotomy was performed, but tissue was obtained for histopathologic examination from cervical lymph nodes and jaw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve children underwent complete resection of the intraabdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in this group, and 10 of 12 children are long-term survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients, debulking of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 4, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> had perforated the bowel and caused widespread intraperitoneal deposits and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during the immediate postoperative period, 2 caused by peritoneal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and 1 caused by surgical trauma in advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three of 15 patients have survived for more than 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lastly, in 14 children only a biopsy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Notable features in this group were that 6 patients had extraabdominal disease and another 6 presented initially with features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the latter group, intestinal bypass procedures were performed but no debulking was attempted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Five of 14 patients died after surgery, whereas 3 were long-term survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients were administered a chemotherapy regimen consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, Adriamycin, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
