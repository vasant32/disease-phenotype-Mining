<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied 13 consecutive HIV-positive patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who underwent one or more PET/CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 5 of 5 patients imaged before treatment, PET/CT confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> involved sites detected at conventional work-up and demonstrated additional sites in 4 of 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lymph node involvement, which is known to be uncommon in endemic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, was present in 54% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in 3 patients, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was predominantly located in parotid lymph nodes, which is also an unusual finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A negative scan was encountered in 3 of 10 patients imaged during treatment and in 1 of 4 patients imaged after treatment completion and was always associated with lasting complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presence of residual area of uptake was related to both favorable and unfavorable outcome whether performed during treatment (5/7 and 2/7, respectively) or after (1/3 and 2/3, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Areas of increased uptake could be observed in lung (4 cases) or esophagus (3 cases), and were clinically related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We recommend PET/CT for accurate initial staging of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PET/CT is also useful to monitor treatment response, as regression of initial disease can be early observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, PET/CT appears to have prognostic value, as a negative scan was always associated with a favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
