<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that, in addition to IgG Fc receptors, the human myeloid IgA receptor (Fc(alpha)RI, CD89) also effectively triggered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell killing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we used the variable light and heavy chain sequences from another murine anti-HLA class II hybridoma, F3.3, to generate a panel of chimeric human/mouse antibodies, including human immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1), IgA2, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibody production was accomplished by stable transfection of baby hamster kidney cells, and binding activity and specificity were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> constructs demonstrated similar binding to HLA class II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional studies revealed that chimeric IgG1, IgA1, and IgA2 triggered similar levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses of effector populations, however, demonstrated that killing by chimeric IgG1 constructs was triggered mainly by human mononuclear cells and complement, while IgA1 and IgA2 mediated effective lysis by polymorphonuclear neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, IgG1 and both IgA isotypes were equally effective at killing freshly isolated human <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chimeric IgA antibodies against HLA class II may constitute attractive reagents for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
