<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The chromosome translocations characteristic of certain B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598798" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoid tumours</z:e> associate the myc oncogene and immunoglobulin loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The typical t(12;15) in murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> and analogous t(14;8) in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> couple the myc coding region to one of the switch recombination regions within the immunoglobulin heavy (H) chain locus; hence the switch machinery may promote some translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significantly, translocation induces constitutive myc expression, the untranslocated myc allele remaining silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predilection for breakpoints near the 5' end of the c-myc gene may reflect selection for altered myc regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, the stimulatory effect of the H locus context is not understood, but an H locus enhancer participates in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, including one displaying a novel transposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The variant (6;15) translocations found in about 15% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> involve the myc band and the region of chromosome 6 where the kappa locus lies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The t(6;15) is shown here to represent an exchange between C kappa and a chromosome 15 locus (designated pvt-1) which lies unexpectedly far from c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association of myc expression with pvt-1 alterations suggest that myc can be activated at a distance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myc has also been implicated in some T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> by detection of proviral inserts near myc and also, surprisingly, within the pvt-1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inserts near myc appear to activate its expression via the retroviral enhancer </plain></SENT>
