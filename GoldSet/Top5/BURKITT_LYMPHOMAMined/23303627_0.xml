<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, EBV faces challenges: the host cell environment is harsh, and the survival and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of host cells are precisely regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only when host cells receive sufficient survival signals may they immortalize </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To establish efficiently a lytic or long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e>, EBV must escape the host cell immunologic mechanism and resist host cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by interfering with multiple signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review details the apoptotic pathway disrupted by EBV in EBV-infected cells and describes the interactions of EBV gene products with host cellular factors as well as the function of these factors, which decide the fate of the host cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationships between other EBV-encoded genes and proteins of the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Bcl) family are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Still, EBV seems to contribute to establishing its own latency and the formation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> by modifying events that impact cell survival and proliferation as well as the immune response of the infected host </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We discuss potential therapeutic drugs to provide a foundation for further studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> pathogenesis aimed at exploiting novel therapeutic strategies for EBV-associated diseases </plain></SENT>
