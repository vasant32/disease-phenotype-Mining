<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean serum levels of ICs measured by solid-phase RIA were significantly higher in patients with ICP (n = 23) and SjS (n = 21) than control (n = 15, p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ICs were positive in 10 patients with ICP (43%) and 12 SjS patients (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Raji cell assay also revealed a significantly higher serum ICs levels in patients with ICP (n = 17) and SjS (n = 12) compared with those of control (n = 7, p &lt; 0.025, p &lt; 0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with ICP (41%) and 8 SjS patients (67%) had positive ICs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was in contrast to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of ICs in patients with alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo>, primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002613'>biliary cirrhosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our analysis demonstrated a significant and positive relationship between RIA and Raji cell assay (r = 0.70, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that ICs specific for SP3-1 may play a role in the pathophysiology of ICP and SjS </plain></SENT>
