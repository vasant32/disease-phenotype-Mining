<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic MYC alterations aid in differentiating diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, MYC aberrations are associated with poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization and karyotyping are standard tests for detecting MYC aberrations, but these techniques are laborious and expensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied MYC status of 219 DLBCLs and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> using fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 15% of the cases had an MYC break </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>QRT-PCR analysis of MYC expression showed that 72% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> with an MYC break had aberrantly high or low levels of MYC transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Excluding the cases with aberrantly low MYC expression, we found a significant positive correlation between levels of MYC transcripts and MYC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells; however, QRT-PCR is not readily applicable as a screening tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showed a nuclear staining pattern that was simple to evaluate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentage of MYC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells correlated closely with MYC rearrangement status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 93% of cases with an MYC break had ≥80% MYC cells, in contrast to 3% of nonrearranged cases (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed ≥70% MYC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells to be the optimal cutoff (sensitivity=100%, specificity=93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.992, indicating that immunostaining for Myc protein is an excellent screening test to predict whether an MYC rearrangement is present </plain></SENT>
