<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) confers enhanced growth capability in soft <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mouse, and resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Akata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we have shown that EBV-encoded small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (EBERs) are responsible for these phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We constantly observed the upregulation of bcl-2 oncoprotein expression upon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and expression of EBERs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test whether these phenotypes were due to the upregulation of bcl-2 expression, we introduced bcl-2 into EBV-negative Akata cells at various levels encompassing the range at which EBV-positive cells expressed it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As cells expressed bcl-2 at higher levels, they became more capable of growing in soft <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> and became resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, clones expressing bcl-2 at a higher level than EBV-positive Akata cells were negative in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> assay in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, introduction of bax into EBV-positive Akata cells reduced the resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>; however, it failed to reduce the growth capability in soft <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that EBV targets not only bcl-2, but also an unknown pathway(s) to enhance the oncogenic potential of Akata cells </plain></SENT>
