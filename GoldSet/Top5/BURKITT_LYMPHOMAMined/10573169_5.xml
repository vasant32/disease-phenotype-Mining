<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a high frequency of sequence variation within functionally important domains of EBNA-1, with five subtypes identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individuals may be infected with multiple EBV strains (classified according to EBNA-1 subtype), but Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> carry a single subtype and exhibit some subtype preference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subtype variation has also been related to geographical location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study EBNA-1 polymorphisms were examined in a series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> from two distinct geographical regions, Brazil and the United Kingdom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequence analysis of the carboxy-terminal region of EBNA-1 in 34 cases revealed six distinct sequences, some of which are novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A new subtype, named V-Ala, was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBNA-1 subtype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> differed markedly according to geographical location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous studies, we found evidence of EBNA-1 sequence variation within individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
