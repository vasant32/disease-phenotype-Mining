<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The records of 16 children who had Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven of these children presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">abdominal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of these 11 patients are long-term survivors and six have died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were primarily resected; two were in patients who became long-term survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One resection was complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo>, leading to the early demise of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were debulked; only one of these was in a long-term survivor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>Acute renal failure</z:hpo> also complicated the hospital course in one of these children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, four patients underwent initial incisional biopsies and plans were made for subsequent resection of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> 6 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of these children survived and two have died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this pilot study do not confirm that there is a clear advantage to aggressive operative cytoreduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although this approach decreases the total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden, it may also impose severe metabolic complications and postpone the administration of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results do suggest the need for a multi-institutional review of the surgical management of abdominal Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
