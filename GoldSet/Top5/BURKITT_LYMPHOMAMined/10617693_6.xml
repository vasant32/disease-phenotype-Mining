<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Dolastatin 10 is a highly cytotoxic antimitotic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in phase II clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its cytotoxicity has been as much as 50-fold greater than that of vinblastine, despite quantitatively similar effects of the two drugs on tubulin polymerization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared uptake and efflux of radiolabeled dolastatin 10 and vinblastine in human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> CA46 cells to gain an understanding of the greater cytotoxicity of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the Burkitt cells, dolastatin 10 was 20-fold more cytotoxic than vinblastine (IC(50) values, 50 pM and 1.0 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When drug uptake at 24 h was compared at IC(50) values of the two drugs, the intracellular concentrations were almost identical (50-100 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The accumulation factor observed for dolastatin 10 was 900 to 1800 versus 60 to 100 for vinblastine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two drugs showed very divergent uptake kinetics, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vinblastine and dolastatin 10 reached maximum intracellular concentrations after 20 min and 6 h, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of cellular ATP content did not alter the uptake of either drug, indicating passive uptake of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When drug-preloaded cells were transferred to drug-free medium, there was no loss of dolastatin 10 for at least 2 h, whereas vinblastine exited the cells rapidly (approximate intracellular half-life, 10 min), with less than 10% of the initial drug remaining in the cells after the 2-h incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The potency of dolastatin 10 probably derives from its tenacious binding to tubulin, a property that in cells becomes translated into prolonged intracellular retention of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Optimal clinical use of dolastatin 10 may require administration by infusion rather than by bolus </plain></SENT>
