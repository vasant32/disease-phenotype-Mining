<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the HIF-1alpha-deficient human leukemic cell line, Z-33, exposed to mild (8% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) or severe (1% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, we found significant upregulation of two related heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) and cold inducible <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-binding protein (CIRP), which are highly conserved cold stress proteins with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-binding properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> also induced upregulation of RBM3 and CIRP in the murine HIF-1beta-deficient cell line, Hepa-1 c4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In various HIF-1 competent cells, RBM3 and CIRP were induced by moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (32 degrees C) but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was ineffective in increasing HIF-1alpha or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a known HIF-1 target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> induced VEGF but not RBM3 or CIRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RBM3 and CIRP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increase after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin-D</z:chebi>, and in vitro nuclear run-on assays demonstrated specific increases in RBM3 and CIRP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, which suggests that regulation takes place at the level of gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp>-induced RBM3 or CIRP transcription was inhibited by the respiratory chain inhibitors NaN(3) and <z:chebi fb="53" ids="17514">cyanide</z:chebi> in a dose-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, cells depleted of mitochondria were still able to upregulate RBM3 and CIRP in response to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, RBM3 and CIRP are adaptatively expressed in response to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> by a mechanism that involves neither HIF-1 nor mitochondria </plain></SENT>
