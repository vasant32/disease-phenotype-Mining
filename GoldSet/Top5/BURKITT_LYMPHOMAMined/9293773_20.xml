<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Class I histocompatibility proteins fold and assemble with beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) into heterodimers before binding short <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in the endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that class I proteins rapidly form <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonds, and that the process is highly reversible in Daudi cells lacking beta 2m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three distinct class I protein conformations are present in equal amounts in these cells, each associated with the molecular chaperone calnexin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When binding of calnexin is inhibited by the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine, fully oxidized class I proteins are no longer detected, suggesting that calnexin is required for completion of folding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in Daudi cells transfected to express beta 2m, castanospermine decreases only slightly the levels of fully oxidized class I proteins, indicating that folding is much less dependent on calnexin in the presence of beta 2m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, calreticulin, a chaperone with functional similarities to calnexin, associates with class I molecules in beta 2m-positive cells. but not in Daudi cells, consistent with completion of folding and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bond formation of class I heavy chains before binding to calreticulin occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that calnexin and beta 2m can function independently to promote folding of class I heavy chains prior to formation of stable class I dimers </plain></SENT>
