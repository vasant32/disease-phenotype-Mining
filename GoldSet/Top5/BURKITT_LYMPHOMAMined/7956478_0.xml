<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lymphocytes separation by a rosetting method and chromosome translocation analysis using chromosome painting were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the case presented here, the utility of this approach is illustrated using blood lymphocytes from a nuclear dockyard worker who claims that his <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was induced by work-related radiation exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood lymphocytes were obtained after diagnosis of the disease, but prior to therapy, and measurements made of (1) the translocation frequency in separated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T-lymphocytes and (2) the translocation frequency in phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated lymphocytes, which include a fraction of the malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The approach described here makes possible biodosimetry of pre-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> exposures in these patients and may provide the dosimetric information required to establish the "probability of causation" for the observed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
