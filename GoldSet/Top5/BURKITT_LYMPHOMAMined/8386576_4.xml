<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>26 and 7 clones were isolated from PB-LAM and BM-LAM respectively by limiting dilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these had surface IgM lambda and the CD10 marker with low to absent CD23, CD30, CD39 and surface <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, they shared the same chromosomal abnormalities (<z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 7 and t(8;14) translocation) and the same rearrangements of immunoglobulin L and H chain and of c-myc gene loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These features are those most frequently found in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells and were different from those of the parental cell lines, which, besides cells identical to those of the malignant clones, also contained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the cloning procedure used selected for the growth of cells with malignant features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBV latent antigens were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clones by Western blotting and their pattern of expression resembled that usually observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the clones were positive for the EBV genome by Southern blotting and had monomorphic EBV-fused termini as determined by using cDNA probes specific for sequences at either end of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the clones derived from PB-LAM had EBV fused termini of a different size from that of the clones derived from BM-LAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of different EBV-fused termini in otherwise monoclonal malignant cells indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> was possibly a late event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> following rearrangement of the c-myc and the Ig gene loci </plain></SENT>
