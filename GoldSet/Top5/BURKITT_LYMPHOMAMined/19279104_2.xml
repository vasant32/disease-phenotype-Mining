<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ability of p65RelA to interact with the LMP1 promoter was shown by in vitro and in vivo assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using an EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line as a reporter system for the activity of the +40/-328 LMP1 promoter region, the functional importance of NF-kappaB and other transcription factor binding sites was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p65RelA could also induce LMP1 expression from the EBV genome in Daudi and P3HR1 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, it was shown that p65RelA could cooperate with EBNA2 or the aryl <z:chebi fb="59" ids="24632">hydrocarbon</z:chebi> receptor in the transactivation of the LMP1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study established the importance of NF-kappaB and several cis-acting elements in the regulation of the LMP1 promoter in a latency III environment and highlighted a complex interplay between NF-kappaB and other transcription factors in this process </plain></SENT>
