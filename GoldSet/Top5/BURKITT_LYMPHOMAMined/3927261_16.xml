<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have cloned and sequenced a rearranged V lambda gene from a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line PA682(PB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cell line has two rearranged kappa loci and has been shown to be expressing kappa light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This V lambda gene has been identified as a member of the V lambda subgroup III gene family based on the homology of the predicted amino acid sequence of PAV lambda with the reported sequences of the V lambda protein DEL of subgroup III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine cross-hybridizing bands have been detected on Southern blots and the chromosomal orientation of the V lambda subgroup III gene family has been determined in relation to the V lambda subgroup I gene family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the PAV lambda rearrangement has occurred via a legitimate V-J joining and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> size transcript is detected on Northern blots, the nucleotide sequence reveals a high level of mutations resulting in multiple termination signals within the V gene coding sequence and only a truncated V lambda protein can be translated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This confirms previous observations that although multiple light chain genes may be transcribed, only one functional light chain protein can be synthesized </plain></SENT>
