<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Decay-accelerating factor (DAF), a membrane protein that regulates the complement system, was purified to homogeneity from lymphoblastoid (Raji) cells (DAF-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It exhibited almost the same molecular weight as DAF from stroma of erythrocytes (DAF-S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Purified DAF-R, which could be reincorporated into cell membranes, accelerated the decay of the C3 convertases, in both the classical (C4b2a) and the alternative (C3bBb) pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This activity was completely inhibited by a monoclonal anti-DAF antibody, 1C6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From these results, DAF-R and DAF-S can not be distinguished; however, the decay-accelerating activity of DAF-R was much higher than that of DAF-S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>1C6 enhanced the binding of C3 to Raji cells by incubating with six purified components of the alternative pathway, whereas it did not induce the killing of Raji cells after a short incubation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When antibodies against Raji cells were added to the above system, the blocking of DAF activity by 1C6 resulted in efficient killing of Raji cells by autologous complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From these results, it is clear that DAF on nucleated cells plays an important role in protecting these cells from the damage caused by autologous complement </plain></SENT>
