<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The status of the p53 gene in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis demonstrated that no major deletions or rearrangements had occurred in the p53 gene in any of the cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The p53 protein was examined by immunoprecipitation using two monoclonal anti-p53 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PAb1801 recognizes both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PAb240 reacts exclusively with mutant p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen LCLs reacted with PAb1801, but not with PAb240, suggesting that none of them expressed mutant p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, one LCL had mutant p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This LCL differs from other LCLs in that it grows to higher cell densities and has a higher <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> clonability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> expressed p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Out of 15 BLs, nine (60%) carried mutant p53, as indicated by their reactivity with PAb240 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> with mutant p53, eight Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three out of the six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 were EBV-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multiple EBV-converted sublines <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exhibited the same p53 status as the parental line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the p53 gene is mutated in a majority of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>), and suggest that p53 mutation contributes to the malignant phenotype of these cell lines </plain></SENT>
