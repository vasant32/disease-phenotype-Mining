<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By affinity chromatography on peanut agglutinin-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi>, receptors for peanut agglutinin were isolated from three lines of human malignant cells labeled with [3H]-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cell lines examined were a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line Daudi, a lung squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> QG-56 and a gastric signet ring <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> KATO-III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The isolated receptors from the three sources had similar properties and behaved as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> with apparent molecular weights of 160,000 to 280,000 upon <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, they showed molecular weights of only around 70,000 upon gel filtration, suggesting that they contained large amounts of carbohydrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pronase digestion depolymerized the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi>, though significant amounts of the products were large enough to be excluded from a column of Sephadex G-50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The large molecular weight products were not detected when the receptors were treated with mild alkali and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50985">NaBH4</z:chebi> prior to pronase digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major components of the radioactive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi> released in the latter case had molecular weights in the range from 3,500 to less than 1,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> receptors had clusters of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> chains of small and medium sizes </plain></SENT>
