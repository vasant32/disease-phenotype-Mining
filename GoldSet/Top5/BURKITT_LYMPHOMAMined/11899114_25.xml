<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data collected from a case-control study including 1842 ALL cases (age &lt; 15 years) and 1986 individually matched controls were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exposure information was obtained through telephone interviews of parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Factors associated with risk of ALL from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups combined included high birth weight (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.8), high birth order (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.3-3.0 for fourth-born child compared to first-born child). young maternal age (&lt;20 compared to 25-29, OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.9), advanced paternal age (&gt;39 compared to 25-29, OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0-1.9), induced abortion prior to the index pregnancy (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.0-1.4), and oral contraceptive use during the index pregnancy (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0-2.2) with children under the age of 2 (OR = 5.1, 95% CI = 1.0-24.7) being the predominantly affected group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk of early pre-B-cell ALL increased with advanced paternal age (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.1-2.7) and high birth order (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.1-3.6), while risk of pre-B-cell ALL increased with both younger (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.4-8.4) and advanced maternal age (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.1-5.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T-cell ALL was associated with high birth weight (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.1-5.5) and history of induced abortion (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.3-4.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the association of ALL with birth characteristics and maternal reproductive factors varies with the immunophenotype of the ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to better understand the effect of maternal hormone in the development of subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
