<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated time trends in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> by using Poisson regression methods to analyze data from the National Registry of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Childhood Tumours</z:e>, a long-standing high-quality registry that covers the whole childhood population of Britain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During 1974-2000, the average annual percentage change in rate (AAC) of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) in Britain was 0.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4 to 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This increase was apparently driven by the "common" subtype (expressing the CD10 antigen) of precursor B-cell ALL, for which the estimated AAC during 1980-1996 was 1.4% (95% CI = 0.8 to 2.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant time trend in other subtypes of ALL combined (1980-1996) or in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (1974-2000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small peaks in incidence of ALL in 1976 and 1990 coincided with years immediately following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> epidemics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with hypotheses that some childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> may be triggered by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> occurring close to the time of diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, particularly in conditions of low herd immunity, and raise the possibility that contact with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> shortly before the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> may sometimes be involved </plain></SENT>
