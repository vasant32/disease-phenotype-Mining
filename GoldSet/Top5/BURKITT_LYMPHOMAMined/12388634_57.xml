<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The short circulating half-life of unmodified IFN-alpha makes frequent dosing (daily or three times weekly) over an extended period (6-12 months or more) necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To improve the pharmacokinetics of IFN-alpha and decrease dosing frequency, IFN-alpha was fused to human serum albumin producing a new protein, Albuferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro comparisons of Albuferon and IFN-alpha showed similar antiviral and antiproliferative activities, although Albuferon was less potent on a molar basis than IFN-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the fusion protein were enhanced in monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a single intravenous injection (30 microg/kg,) clearance was 0.9 ml/h/kg, and the terminal half-life was 68 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 30 microg/kg subcutaneous injection, apparent clearance (clearance divided by bioavailability) was 1.4 ml/h/kg, the terminal half-life was 93 h, and bioavailability was 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of clearance of Albuferon was approximately 140-fold slower, and the half-life 18-fold longer, than for IFN-alpha given by the subcutaneous route in other monkey studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sera from Albuferon-treated monkeys demonstrated dose-related antiviral activity for &gt; or =8 days based on an in vitro bioassay, whereas antiviral activity from IFN-alpha-treated animals was only slightly elevated relative to vehicle on day 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant increases in 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> relative to IFN-alpha- or vehicle-treated animals were maintained for &gt; or =10 days after subcutaneous dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The improved pharmacokinetics of Albuferon are accompanied by an improved pharmacodynamic response suggesting that Albuferon may offer the benefits of less frequent dosing and a potentially improved efficacy profile compared with IFN-alpha </plain></SENT>
