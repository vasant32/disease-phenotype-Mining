<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether ZAP-70 can directly govern migration and the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the ZAP-70 stably transfected Ramos cell line, IgM stimulation, but no IgD, enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt and Syk, and delayed IgM and CD79b internalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the Raji cell line, where ZAP-70 was constitutively phosphorylated, ERK1/2, but not Akt, was phosphorylated, suggesting that MAPK pathway mediates ZAP-70 effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BCR stimulation modulated the expression of CCR7, CXCR4, CXCR5, CD44, CD49d, and CD62L, which were up-regulated in ZAP-70-positive CLL primary subclones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most dramatic change after BCR engagement in ZAP-70-transfected cells was CCR7 up-regulation, this being impaired by ERK1/2 inhibition and translating into both increased signaling and migration toward CCL21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary CLL subclones with high ZAP-70 expression showed increased migration toward CCL21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ZAP-70 ectopic expression led to enhanced BCR signaling after IgM stimulation and increased the expression of CCR7 predominantly via ERK1/2, increasing the response and migration toward CCL21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In primary CLL samples, cellular subsets with high ZAP-70 expression had increased expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and chemokine receptors in addition to an enhanced ability to migrate toward CCL21 </plain></SENT>
