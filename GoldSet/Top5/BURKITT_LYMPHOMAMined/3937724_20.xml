<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A variant mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> (MPC)-associated translocation chromosome has arisen by pericentric inversion and exchange of the distal segments of a Robertsonian 6;15 fusion chromosome in the CAK TEPC 1198 mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo>, as described earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization was performed on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and the inverted Rb chromosomes, using myc and kappa probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Rb chromosome, myc was in the 15 D2/3 region, whereas kappa hybridized in the 6 C2 area, as expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the inverted Rb chromosome, myc remains on the centrometric side of the translocation breakpoint on the chromosome 15-derived portion, whereas kappa has moved to the chromosome 6-derived segment that joined the same breakpoint on the telomeric side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken together with our recent demonstration that the murine c-myc locus is oriented 'head up' on chromosome 15, and with the results of Cory and co-workers concerning the relationship between the kappa gene and the associated pvt-1 region in the CAK TEPC 1198 tumor, the following conclusions can be drawn: (i) in the variant translocation of the CAK TEPC 1198 MPC, the breakage occurs 3' of the c-myc gene, as in the human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated variant translocations; (ii) the pvt-1 gene on chromosome 15 is distal to the myc gene; (iii) the kappa light chain locus is oriented 'head up' on mouse chromosome 6 and faces pvt-1 and, beyond it, c-myc, in a head-to-tail configuration </plain></SENT>
