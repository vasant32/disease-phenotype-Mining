<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since only one-third of primary Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) demonstrate mutations in the p53 gene, we examined the structural integrity of the p21 coding region by single-strand conformational polymorphism and DNA sequence analysis to determine the extent to which this gene is mutated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 34 BLs analyzed, a frequent change (38%) at codon 31 that replaced Ser with Arg was found in 13 samples, 10 of which were from Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This change at codon 31 is also detected in peripheral blood DNA from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and may thus represent a polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line, DH978, carried a change at codon 63: Phe to Leu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This mutation was heterozygous, and both the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and the mutated p21 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were expressed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By transfection experiments, the mutant p21 was less efficient in suppressing clonogenicity than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the only mutation described in p21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The availability of this mutant p21 should further help in functional studies of p21 </plain></SENT>
