<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The HR1 cell line failed to support D2 growth while the other cell lines showed varying susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both D2 strain 16681 and strain New Guinea C (NGC) passaged in LLC-MK2 cells replicated readily in Raji cells, while a high mouse-brain-passaged NGC strain did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A soluble complement-fixing (SCF) antigen from D2-infected Raji cells showed lines of identity with a D2SCF antigen prepared from infected suckling mouse brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic studies of a D2 Raji carrier culture showed that virions were located in a membrane-vesicle complex in the cytoplasm of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Precursors of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> particles were more frequently observed in the parts of the vesicle which had rough endoplasmic reticular membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mature virus particles were observed often at the boundary of the other part of the vesicle, which consisted of smooth endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, a large crystalloid structure consisting of incomplete <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> particles was seen in degenerative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Dengue</z:e> carrier cultures in human lymphoblastoid lines may provide a convenient in vitro system for study of aspects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dengue</z:e> virus-leukocyte interactions </plain></SENT>
