<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The changes of the OKT antigens on the surface of cord blood LAK cells tested with monoclonal antibodies was described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The morphologic changes resulted from the killing activity of LAK cells to target cells were observed by microscopy and electron-microscopy after a definite time co-incubation of the LAK cells and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that: (1) LAK cells could be induced from cord blood and the induced LAK cells could remarkably kill the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subculture cell lines including nature killer (NK)-sensitive K562 cells as well as NK-insensitive Raji cells; (2) The activity of cord blood LAK cells is higher than that of the LAK cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0699889" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gynecologic cancer</z:e> patient's PBL, But no significant difference with that of the LAK cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult's PBL; (3) T+3, T+8, the OKT antigens of cord blood LAK cells are just the same as human LAK cells from other sources; (4) After a definite time co-incubation, the cord blood LAK cells and Raji cells could form atypical rosette-circles under light microscopy </plain></SENT>
