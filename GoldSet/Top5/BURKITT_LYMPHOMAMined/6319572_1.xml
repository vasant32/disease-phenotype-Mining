<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At a dosage of 0.03 to 0.1 mM, BVdU caused a marked inhibition of (i) spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (VCA) expression in B-95-8 and P3 hybrid cells, (ii) VCA expression and DNA synthesis in B-95-8 cells induced with croton oil and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi>, (iii) early antigen (EA) expression and DNA synthesis in Raji cells superinfected with EBV, and (iv) VCA expression and DNA synthesis in B-95-8 cells superinfected with EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In its inhibitory effects on these various parameters of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, BVdU appears to be comparable to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> [9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi>], another selective anti-herpesvirus drug which has been previously recognized as an effective inhibitor of EBV replication </plain></SENT>
