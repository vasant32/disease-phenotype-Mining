<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL2R alpha) gene is transcriptionally activated by both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol esters</z:chebi> and the HTLV-I trans-activator (Tax) protein through a mechanism that involves the interaction of inducible DNA binding proteins with a kappa B-like enhancer element (-267 to -256) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using mutated IL2R alpha promoter constructs in transient transfection and DNA binding assays, we now demonstrate that sequences located immediately upstream and downstream of the kappa B enhancer also contribute to the regulation of IL2R alpha gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One upstream sequence termed UE-1 is preferentially required for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> relative to Tax-induced activation and specifically interacts with a constitutively expressed 56-kD cellular factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, two overlapping downstream elements between <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> -252 and -239 appear to be required for both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> and Tax-induced activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of these elements, an Sp1-like sequence, binds a constitutively expressed 100-kD T-cell protein consistent in size with Sp1 isolated from HeLa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second element, located between the kappa B and Sp1 sites, resembles the decanucleotide core of the serum response element (SRE) from the c-fos gene and interacts with a constitutively expressed factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings implicate a functional role for multiple constitutively expressed DNA binding proteins, in addition to the inducible kappa B-specific factors, in the overall regulation of IL2R alpha gene activation </plain></SENT>
