<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), although not an indispensable factor for the development of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, is apparently associated with the 20-fold higher incidence of the disease in Equatorial Africa compared to the incidence in other parts of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether different EBV subtypes are associated with the appearance of the malignant phenotype, we have compared the EBV genomes carried in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> cells with those carried in the nonmalignant lymphoblastoid cells from the same individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From three patients with EBV -associated Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines as well as spontaneously established lymphoblastoid cell lines representing the nonmalignant counterparts were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA in these cell lines was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization, using a set of cloned EBV DNA fragments as probes that recognize polymorphic regions in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a number of different polymorphic markers to distinguish one isolate from another, the virus genome found in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells could also be identified in the nonmalignant cells of the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one case, in which two independent lymphoblastoid cell lines were established, evidence was obtained that this patient was infected by at least two distinct EBV subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the risk associated with EBV is related to cofactors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> and the mode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rather than to peculiar <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The situation seems to be totally different from papillomavirus-associated diseases, in which the risk of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> appears to be associated with particular <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> strains </plain></SENT>
