<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We herein studied if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">ketoconazole</z:chebi> may suppress B cell IgE class switching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-4 plus anti-CD40-induced IgE secretion was enhanced in peripheral blood surface IgE- B cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001047'>atopic dermatitis</z:hpo> patients compared to those from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors, and the secretion was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">ketoconazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">Ketoconazole</z:chebi> suppressed interleukin-4 plus anti-CD40-induced germline and mature epsilon transcripts in surface IgE- B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">Ketoconazole</z:chebi> also inhibited interleukin-4 plus anti-CD40-induced activation of germline epsilon promoter in human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The regions -171/-155 bp containing CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein element and -155/-109 bp containing Stat6 and nuclear factor kappaB elements were required for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">ketoconazole</z:chebi>-induced inhibition of the germline epsilon promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">Ketoconazole</z:chebi> inhibited interleukin-4 plus anti-CD40-induced enhancer activities of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein and nuclear factor kappaB, and those of composite elements of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein/Stat6 or of Stat6/nuclear factor kappaB, but did not alter that of Stat6 in Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>cAMP analog reversed the inhibitory effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">ketoconazole</z:chebi> on interleukin-4 plus anti-CD40-induced IgE secretion, germline and mature epsilon transcripts, and epsilon germline promoter activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-4 plus anti-CD40 increased intracellular cAMP by activating cAMP-synthesizing adenylate cyclase in surface IgE- B cells, and the increase was greater in the cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001047'>atopic dermatitis</z:hpo> patients than in those from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">Ketoconazole</z:chebi> suppressed interleukin-4 plus anti-CD40-induced activation of adenylate cyclase in surface IgE- B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">ketoconazole</z:chebi> may suppress interleukin-4 plus anti-CD40-induced B cell IgE class switching by inhibiting cAMP signal, and stress its prophylactic effects on allergic diseases </plain></SENT>
