<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in ethnic distribution or sex ratio between children with AT and ST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age was younger in those with AT than with ST (4.7 vs 7.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 3 major histologic AT types were Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo>, with a relative increase after 1978 in those with abdominal Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A comparison of our therapeutic results in AT treated before and after 1981 shows significant improvement in the actuarial survival at 5 years: 71.1% of those treated after 1981 were then alive with no evidence of disease, vs only 32.8% of those treated before 1981 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since 1981 the actuarial survival at 5 years in our children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> and abdominal Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is about 80% </plain></SENT>
