<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to analyse retrospectively the patient survival and mortality risk factors in renal transplant children at Edouard-Herriot hospital, Lyon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and ninety four patients 0 to less than 18 years of age received a renal transplant between April 1987 and January 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We collected data concerning the age at transplantation, the mean duration of dialysis prior to transplantation, the type of donor (living related: LRD, or cadaver: CAD) as well as long term follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients died during the study period and we collected mortality and morbidity factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age at transplantation was 9.5 years (range: 0.6-17.9 years); 16 children were transplanted before 2 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty six percent received a first graft, 10% a second graft, and 3% a third graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One third of the patients had preemptive transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The graft was carried out respectively from a LRD in 18% and from CAD in 82% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (5.7%) died during this period; four of them were transplanted twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred within 2.4 years after transplantation (range: 2 days-6.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five of these deceased children developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rejection episode treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> pulses and OKT3 monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four had a cytomegalovirus (CMV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and three required repeated surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (4/11), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> (2/11), neurological involvement (2/11), Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1/11) and unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> (2/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The main causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in renal transplant children are <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The improvement in patient survival probably will come from both better preventive approach to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nosocomial infections</z:e> and a less aggressive immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
