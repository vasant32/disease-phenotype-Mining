<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one cases of ALL previously studied by classical metaphase cytogenetics were retrospectively analysed using a centromere-specific chromosome 7 probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five cases with karyotypic abnormalities of chromosome 7 (2 with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 7, 2 with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 and 1 with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> &amp; tetrasomy 7) showed a correlation with FISH results, whereas in five other cases <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 was found in 12-43% of cells only by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The unexpected detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 in these latter ALL patients suggests that either these clones are quiescent or unable to enter mitosis in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that FISH and metaphase cytogenetics must be combined whenever possible to obtain comprehensive karyotypic information </plain></SENT>
