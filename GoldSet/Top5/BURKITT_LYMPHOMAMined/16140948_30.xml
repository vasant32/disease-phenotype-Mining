<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study examines the preponderance and mechanism of mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) activation in three distinct types of transformed B lymphocytes that differ in expression of the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three types [EBV-immortalized cells that express a broad spectrum of the virus-encoded genes (type III latency; EBV+/III), EBV-positive cells that express only a subset of the EBV-encoded genes (EBV+/I), and EBV-negative, germinal center-derived cells (EBV-)] universally displayed activation of the mTOR signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, only the EBV+/III transformed B cells displayed also activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway that is considered to be the key activator of mTOR and of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway that coactivates one of the immediate targets of mTOR, p70 S6K1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activation of the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK, but not of the mTOR pathway, was inhibited by serum withdrawal and restored by insulin growth factor-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, activation of mTOR, but not PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK, was sensitive to nutrient <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both direct Akt (Akt inhibitors I-III) and a PI3K inhibitor (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> at 1 nmol/L) suppressed Akt phosphorylation without significantly affecting mTOR activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi>, a potent and specific mTOR inhibitor, suppressed profoundly proliferation of cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three types of transformed B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>U0126, a MEK inhibitor, had a moderate antiproliferative effect only on the EBV+/III cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that mTOR kinase activation is mediated in the transformed B cells by the mechanism(s) independent of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also suggest that inhibition of mTOR signaling might be effective in therapy of the large spectrum of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
