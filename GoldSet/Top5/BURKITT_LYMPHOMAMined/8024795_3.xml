<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biotinylated first-strand cDNA is generated from one cell type and immobilized onto magnetic streptavidin beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Poly A+ <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, isolated from a different cell type by use of oligo-dT beads, is then hybridized to the immobilized cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beads with hybridized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> are subsequently removed from the solution by attraction to a magnet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cell-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, left in solution, is finally converted to a radiolabeled cDNA probe in order to screen cDNA libraries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we present an example of a successful subtraction strategy involving three cell types: the pre-B-cell line Reh; 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>)-stimulated Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line Daudi; and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-stimulated T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This strategy was chosen due to our interest in gene products known to be expressed in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-stimulated B and T lymphocytes, but not in Reh cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several previously unknown genes were identified </plain></SENT>
