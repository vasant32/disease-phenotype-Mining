<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Namalwa sublines examined are DNA fingerprint-identical and derived from a monoclonal source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recombinant DNA clones were used to map the Ig heavy chain gene mutations to a region between the VDJ and C mu segment of the locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This region is associated with Ig heavy chain class switching in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 24 clones established from one subline, three were found to have additional VDJ-C mu region mutations, indicating a high frequency of mutation at this locus </plain></SENT>
