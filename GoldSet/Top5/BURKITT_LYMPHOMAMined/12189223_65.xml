<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo> (KS) and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in the general population has markedly increased since the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> epidemic in 1981 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, during the 1990s, the dynamics of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> epidemic changed, as human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rates slowed and effective antiretroviral therapies were introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the impact of these changes on the general population incidence of KS and NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Age-standardized incidences for KS and NHL from 1973 through 1998 were obtained from nine population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries that participate in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the mid-1990s, KS incidence declined sharply in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decreases in KS incidence were most evident in San Francisco, where KS rates among white men had risen from 0.5 per 100 000 people per year in 1973 to between 31.1 and 33.3 from 1987 through 1991 and then declined to 2.8 in 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With background NHL incidence in the general population being much higher than that for KS, changes in incidence related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> epidemic were most evident in subgroups at high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In San Francisco, NHL rates among white men rose from 10.7 in 1973 to a peak of 31.4 in 1995 and then declined to 21.6 in 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NHL types that were most highly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated declined most steeply, whereas the incidence of NHL types not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> was either stable or increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Changes in KS and NHL incidence since the mid 1990s may reflect declines in the number of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and improved immune function in such individuals following the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapies in the 1990s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Notably, non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated NHL incidence has continued to increase steadily through 1998 </plain></SENT>
