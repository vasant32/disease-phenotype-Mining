<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These results confirmed a previous report (F. de Ferra and C </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in S- adenyosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine was not observed in lymphoblastoid Raji cells, which are not growth inhibited by interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When Daudi cells and two other cell lines sensitive to growth inhibition by interferon were labeled with [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]methionine, two novel labeled compounds were detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis of cell extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These compounds were not present in untreated cells, and were either absent or present in reduced amount in extracts of cells resistant to the antiproliferative effect of interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of the labeled compounds was tentatively identified with 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA), a naturally occurring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi>, which was previously shown to inhibit murine lymphoid cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Addition of MTA to cultures of different cell lines resulted in inhibition of cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the MTA concentration was measured in Daudi cells treated in this way, a relatively low concentration of MTA was detected, which was comparable to that found in interferon-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It seems possible that the presence of MTA in interferon-treated cells contributes to the inhibition of cell growth </plain></SENT>
