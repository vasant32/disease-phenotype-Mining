<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> on two EBV-positive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines by immuno-fluorescence and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the producer line P3HR-1, the drug induced not only early antigen (EA) and virus capsid antigen (VCA) synthesis, as shown before, but also increased the number of cells containing virus particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transition from VCA expression to the formation of virus particles was much more effective in treated cells than in EBV antigen-producing cells of the same line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The productive cycle was associated with the development of characteristic morphological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the non-producer Raji cells, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> induced EA in only a minor fraction of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were, however, clear signs of differentiation in the direction of plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two days after the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> 80% of the Raji cells could be classified as plasmablasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 72 h, 20% of the cells appeared as typical plasma cells </plain></SENT>
