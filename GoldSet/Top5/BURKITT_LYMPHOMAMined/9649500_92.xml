<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deregulation of bcl-6 expression by chromosomal rearrangements and point mutations of the bcl-6 promoter region are implicated in the pathogenesis of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The signals regulating bcl-6 expression are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that antigen receptor activation leads to BCL-6 phosphorylation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation, in turn, targets BCL-6 for rapid degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that BCL-6 expression is directly controlled by the antigen receptor via MAPK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This signaling pathway may be crucial for the control of B-cell differentiation and antibody response and has implications for the regulation of other POZ/zinc finger transcription factors in other tissues </plain></SENT>
