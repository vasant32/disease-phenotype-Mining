<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus is the leading candidate as one of these causative agents, because of its oncogenic properties in the laboratory and its association with two human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, African Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 49 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were grouped according to the histologic type, clinical symptoms and immune state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control group of 140 subjects was selected among healthy people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The antibodies against <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen were measured with immunoperoxidase test, antibodies to nuclear antigen with anticomplement immunofluorescent test, and antibodies to early antigen with immunofluorescence method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT: We found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had antibodies against <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen and nuclear antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found an elevated titers for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen in 69% of patients, early antigen in 41% and nuclear antigen in 55% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of elevated titers (&gt; or = 320 for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen and &gt; or = 40 for early antigen) and nuclear antigen was higher in patients than in control group; the differences were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, the geometric mean of early <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid and of nuclear antibody titers in patients were significantly higher than that in control group (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The possible role of Epstein-Barr virus in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> has been long investigated in epidemiological studies and the finding of Epstein-Barr antibody has been currently supported by the detection of genomic Epstein-Barr virus in diagnostic cells in some cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> varies in prevalence, morphologic findings and association with Epstein-Barr virus in different parts of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> in Yugoslavia and its relationship to Epstein-Barr virus has not yet been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results indicate that elevated titers of antibody against antigens associated with Epstein-Barr virus exist in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Whether this finding reflects a direct role of Epstein-Barr virus or whether this activity is a marker of the effect of a more fundamental factor, is not yet clear </plain></SENT>
