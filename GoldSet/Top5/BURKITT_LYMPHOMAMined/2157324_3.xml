<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytologic examination of peripheral blood smears in both cases showed the presence of numerous large abnormal cells; in one case the cells simulated those of a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytochemical and/or immunologic marker studies ruled out a hematopoietic origin of the malignant cells in both cases and confirmed a diagnosis of carcinocythemia </plain></SENT>
