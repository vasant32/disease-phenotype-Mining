<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the identification of two distinct farnesyltransferases (FTases) in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Separation of Daudi cell cytosolic fractions by ion exchange chromatography resulted in two peaks (FTases I and II) that, on gel filtration, show molecular masses of 90 000 and 250 000 Da, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting experiments showed that FTase I is composed of an alpha/beta-heterodimer of about 50 000 Da each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FTase II contained a beta-subunit that is immunologically indistinguishable from the beta-subunit of FTase I and the previously reported human and rat brain FTase but contained an alpha-subunit that reacted poorly with a rat brain anti-alpha-antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As in rat brain FTase, Daudi FTases I and II both required <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> for enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, their zinc requirements differed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29105">Zn2+</z:chebi>, FTase I had little activity (10%) whereas FTase II had 30% of its maximum activity (maximum activity obtained in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29105">Zn2+</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, whereas both FTases I and II were potently inhibited by KB-Ras C-terminal Cys-Val<z:chebi fb="84" ids="32607">-Ile</z:chebi>-Met <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48030">tetrapeptide</z:chebi> mimics, only FTase I but not FTase II required zinc for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> binding and inhibition </plain></SENT>
