<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The VH genes were derived from the VH 3 (one) and VH4 (six) families and both the IgM-positive (six) and the IgA-positive (one) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutated from their germline counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The VL genes were derived from V kappa 1 (one), V kappa 3 (one), V lambda 1 (four), and V lambda 2 (one) families and were also somatically hypermutated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patterns in VL sequences were consistent with a role for antigen in five of seven cases </plain></SENT>
