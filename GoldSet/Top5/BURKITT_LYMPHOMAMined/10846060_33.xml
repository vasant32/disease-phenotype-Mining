<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>), a potent activator of protein kinase C (PKC), induces reactivation of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the physiological stimuli responsible for the disruption of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latency are not well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) has also been shown to trigger the reactivation of EBV in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines; however, the effect of TGF-beta1 on ZEBRA expression has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To further understand this phenomenon, we have investigated the effect of TGF-beta1 on ZEBRA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the treatment of different EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines with TGF-beta1 induces a time-dependent activation of BZLF1 transcription with a corresponding increase in the production of the protein ZEBRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta1 has been shown to exert its effects through a wide range of intracellular routes; in the present study, we have explored these pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transient expression of Smad proteins on their own had no effect on ZEBRA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A specific inhibitor of p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK), SB203580, did not affect TGF-beta1-induced ZEBRA expression, whereas treatment with the MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126, dramatically decreased this induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that TGF-beta1 effect on BZLF1 expression requires the MAPK pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in Raji and B95-8 cells additional routes can be used, as (i) the inhibition of ZEBRA induction by PD98059 or U0126 was incomplete, whereas these inhibitors completely abolished <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-induced ZEBRA expression, (ii) TGF-beta1 induction of ZEBRA expression occurs in PKC-depleted cells, (iii) in Raji and in B95-8 cells, the effect of TGF-beta1 and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> are additive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Transient transfection of the EBV-negative B-cell line DG75 with a BZLF1 promoter-fusion construct (Zp-CAT) showed that under conditions where the BZLF1 promoter is activated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> treatment, TGF-beta1 had no significant effect on the expression of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, TGF-beta1 induction of BZLF1 transcripts is dependent on de novo protein synthesis, which suggests that TGF-beta1 induces BZLF1 expression by an indirect mechanism </plain></SENT>
