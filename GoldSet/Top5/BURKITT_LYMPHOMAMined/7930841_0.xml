<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The inability to measure precancer-related genetic damage accurately in blood cells of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has prevented the use in such patients of available biodosimetric methods to determine prior exposure to clastogenic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is because a substantial amount of disease-related genetic damage appears in the blood cells of these patients, thus masking genetic damage that may have been caused prior to the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a new approach that may be used to measure precancer-related chromosomal aberrations in such patients by totally separating the affected T lymphocytes from the malignant B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The approach employs stable chromosome translocations and will detect prior exposures above the detection limit of approximately 0.05-0.1 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The utility of this approach is illustrated by using blood lymphocytes from a nuclear dockyard worker who claims his B cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> was induced by work-related radiation exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood lymphocytes were obtained after diagnosis of the disease, but prior to therapy, and measurements were made of the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in PHA-stimulated lymphocytes without prior separation of T and B cells and in T lymphocytes after complete separation from B cells using a rosetting technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results show that the separation of T cells prior to PHA stimulation eliminates the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related chromosomal damage and thus appears to facilitate biodosimetry of pre-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> exposures in such patients </plain></SENT>
