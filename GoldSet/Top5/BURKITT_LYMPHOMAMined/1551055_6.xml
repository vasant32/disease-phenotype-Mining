<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Leukocytes cells contain relatively high concentrations of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26948,33283">thiamine</z:chebi>-dependent enzymes compared with erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because no other cause could be found, it was postulated that consumption of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26948,33283">thiamine</z:chebi> by blast cells was responsible for the deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After studying this patient, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18290">thiamine pyrophosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="35033,52279,9532">TPP</z:chebi>) effect was measured in five other consecutive patients with fast-growing hematologic <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two patients, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35033,52279,9532">TPP</z:chebi> effect was elevated slightly, but another patient had a definite <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26948,33283">thiamine</z:chebi> deficiency with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the clinician be alert for this underdiagnosed potentially fatal but easily treatable deficiency in nonalcoholic patients with fast-growing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
