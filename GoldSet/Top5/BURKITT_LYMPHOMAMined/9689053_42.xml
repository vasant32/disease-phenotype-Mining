<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MYC and the closely related MYCN encode highly conserved nuclear phosphoproteins (Myc and NMyc) that apparently function as transcription factors in the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified a large and highly conserved nuclear protein that interacts directly with the transcriptional activating domain of Myc (designated "protein associated with Myc" or Pam) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pam contains an extended amino acid sequence with similarities to a protein known as regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1), which may play a role in the function of chromatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding Pam (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi>) is expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the human tissue examined, but expression is exceptionally abundant in brain and thymus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pam binds specifically to Myc, but not NMyc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The region in Myc required for binding to Pam includes a domain that is essential for the function of Myc and that is frequently mutated in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi> is located within a 300-kb region on chromosome 13q22 </plain></SENT>
