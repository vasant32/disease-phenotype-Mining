<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The alpha 2 beta 1 integrin is expressed in a variety of cell types, but in cells of hematopoietic lineage, expression is restricted to megakaryocytes and platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin during megakaryocytic differentiation is a consequence of transcriptional activation of the alpha 2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have begun to characterize the role of the 5' flanking region of the alpha 2 integrin gene in regulating expression during megakaryocyte differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 5-kb fragment of the 5' region directs both cell type and differentiation-dependent expression of a reporter gene in the pluripotent hematopoietic K562 cells upon megakaryocytic differentiation and in the megakaryocytic cell line, Dami </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of a series of 5' deletion mutants indicates that expression of the alpha 2 integrin gene in cells with megakaryocytic features requires a core promoter region, a silencer region, and megakaryocytic enhancers in the distal 5' end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The organization of these three distinct regulatory regions of the alpha 2 promoter/enhancer suggests a common theme for megakaryocytic gene regulation shared with other megakaryocyte-specific proteins, including alpha IIb integrin subunit and platelet factor 4 </plain></SENT>
