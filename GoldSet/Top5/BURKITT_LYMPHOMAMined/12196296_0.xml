<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our research concerned the impact of chemotherapy on the haematological and biochemical profiles of patients diagnosed with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood diseases</z:e> and receiving treatment in Abidjan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study covered 57 patients, 26 of whom were receiving treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the most common type of malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1533163" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood disease</z:e> encountered (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of men was slightly higher, at 54%, and the average age of patients was 26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hyperleucocytosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and medullar blastosis were the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> arising from hyperleucocytosis and medullar blastosis caused increases in proteins from inflammatory reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase was moderate for alpha 1 globulins and haptoglobin and high (at least twice the reference levels) for C Reactive Protein (CRP) and orosomucoid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Full remission was only achieved in the cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in which the haematological and biochemical parameters reached near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> the treatment lowered the hyperleucocytosis but the high rate of CRP might indicate that the disease was reaching a more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, chemotherapy did not achieve full remission: the alpha 1 globulins, including orosomucoids, were the most sensitive proteins to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even though the rate of CRP was lowered, it remained high in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neither haematological nor biochemical data proved superior to the other in monitoring the effectiveness of the treatment or the gradual return of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It would be beneficial to combine them in order to obtain a clearer assessment of the effectiveness of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
