<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both cell lines expressed the same IgM, kappa phenotype as the original <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The karyotype of Es I was 46, XY, t(8;14), 2 p+, inv (6p), 17p-, and the cells of Es III had an additional i(7q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin gene studies demonstrated the identical monoclonal rearrangements in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither EBV nor HIV sequences were detectable in the malignant B cells at the genomic level, leading to the conclusion that mechanisms other than transformation by EBV or HIV may have contributed to the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in this patient and possibly also to the generally increased frequency in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
