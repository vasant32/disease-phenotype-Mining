<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) as an inducer or modulator of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and/or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha does not induce either <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in EBV-positive or -negative cell lines, regardless of the culture conditions of the cells or the presence or absence of cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast anti-IgM induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in two EBV-negative cell lines (Ramos and ST486) but not in EBV-positive cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since TNF receptor and CD40 belong to the TNF receptor superfamily and anti-CD40 is a known inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we tested for TNF-alpha's effects on the inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by anti-IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that TNF-alpha inhibits <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by anti-IgM in Ramos cells but not in ST486 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects are dose and time dependent; the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> achieved and the selectivity of the effect among cell lines are strikingly similar for both TNF-alpha and anti-CD40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore when both agents are tested together no additivity in the inhibition is observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is a direct effect of TNF-alpha and not a permissive effect of another cytokine, since it is observed in defined medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although anti-IgM induces both TNF-alpha secretion and TNF receptors in Ramos cells, the concentration of secreted TNF-alpha is too low to affect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition does not involve perturbation of the cell cycle distribution of Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore rapid induction of c-fos and the decrease in c-myc observed after anti-IgM treatment are both unaltered by TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that TNF-alpha is an inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Ramos cells, that its overall pattern of inhibition is similar to that of anti-CD40, and that both agents act at some point distal to the alteration of c-fos and c-myc by anti-IgM </plain></SENT>
