<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of mutant forms of the p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor are a hallmark of many transformed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple mechanisms such as increased stability of the protein and increased transcription of the gene can account for elevated p53 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent findings indicate that c-Myc/Max heterodimers can bind to an essential CA(C/T)GTG-containing site in the p53 promoter and elevate its expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have addressed the possibility that elevated mutant p53 expression is due to deregulated c-Myc expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that the human p53 promoter is transactivated by high c-Myc expression and repressed by high Max expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In examining the relative levels of c-Myc and p53 in human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and other B-lymphoid lines, we found that there is a correlation between the levels of c-Myc protein and p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, cells that express very low levels of c-Myc protein also express low levels of p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, while cells that express high levels of c-Myc tend to express high levels of p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the p53 gene can be a target for c-Myc in vivo, we assayed the effects of antisense c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> on the levels of endogenous p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the presence of antisense c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> leads to a reduction in the levels of c-Myc protein, p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and expression from the p53 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our findings support a direct role for c-Myc in elevating expression of the mutant p53 gene in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
