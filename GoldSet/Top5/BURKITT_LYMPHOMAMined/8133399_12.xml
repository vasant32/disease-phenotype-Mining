<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The introduction of microwave detection systems has significantly enhanced the sensitivity of immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The combination of protease digestion and microwave treatment including the use of heavy metal salts or <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> gives an Ig heavy and light chain detection system in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded material as good as that achieved using fresh frozen material, with the advantage of a well-preserved <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of this method depends on the heavy metal salt used and its concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> yields equally sensitive results, while avoiding the toxicity of heavy metal salts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heating times in the microwave oven also have an important influence on the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The microwave-based technique may allow for the improved accessibility of formalin-masked antigens, as was shown here for cytoplasmic and surface immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was demonstrated that formalin-fixed specimens of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> when subjected to the new protocol almost always showed surface Ig expression, giving results comparable to those obtained in frozen sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it could be shown that in cases of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-CLL) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e>, surface and cytoplasmic Ig could be detected, so that the difference may be just a quantitative one and thus may no longer be safely used as a criterion in differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In future, the wide use of this technique will allow for the study of Ig expression at the single cell level in morphologically well-preserved material </plain></SENT>
