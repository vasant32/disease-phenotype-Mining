<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B lymphocytes are exposed to low oxygen tensions during their development, but the influence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> on their <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> is associated with up-regulation of CXCR4 expression in human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant B cells, through both transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a dichotomic functional response to CXCR4 triggering was observed: both peripheral B cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> arising from mature B cells displayed increased responses to CXCR4 triggering under <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, whereas germinal center (GC) B cells as well as GC-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed CXCR4 receptor desensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was associated with differential modulation of key signal-transducing molecules, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 and regulator of G protein signaling molecule-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The unresponsiveness of GC-derived lymphomatous B cells to CXCR4 triggering under <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> may have implications for the development and pathogenesis of GC-derived <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
