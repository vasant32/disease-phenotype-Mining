<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The unique manifestation of the inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> (XLP), is the impaired control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene, which carries mutations or is deleted in the patients, has been identified (Xq25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The encoded protein (SAP, 128 aa) contains a single SH2 domain and binds to signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) and to other related surface molecules that are expressed on activated T, B and NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAP modifies signal transduction through its association with these molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initially it was assumed that SAP acts passively by interfering and blocking active interactions involving other SH2 carrying molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that SAP protein is expressed in activated T and NK, but not in activated B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding is in line with the fact that in vitro performance of effector cells derived from XLP patients is impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it is still not known why the severe symptoms (fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mononucleosis</z:e> or malignant lymphoproliferation in the survivors of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary infection</z:e>) are elicited by EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We studied SAP expression in several Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) derived lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells, certain lines expressed SAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> type I cells in the Burkitt line nomenclature: they expressed only one of the EBV encoded proteins (EBNA-1) and their phenotype corresponded to resting B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lymphoblastoid cell lines and type III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>, whose phenotype resembled activated B cells and expressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine EBV encoded proteins, were devoid of SAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The relationship between cell activation and SAP expression is reciprocal in T and B cells i.e. <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines, activated T and NK cells express SAP, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> blasts do not express SAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This opposite relationship may be exploited for studies about the function of SAP </plain></SENT>
