<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPPII) has been suggested to compensate for a reduced proteasome activity, partly based on evidence using the inhibitor Ala-Ala-Phe-chloromethylketone (AAF-cmk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that AAF-cmk induces the formation of polyubiquitin-containing accumulations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>osteosarcoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These accumulations meet many of the landmarks of the aggresomes that form after proteasome inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of experiments with chemical inhibitors and interference of gene expression, we show that TPPII inhibition is not responsible for these accumulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our evidence suggests that the relevant target(s) is/are in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, most likely upstream the proteasome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We obtained evidence supporting this model by inhibition of Hsp90, which also acts upstream the proteasome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although our data suggest that Hsp90 is not a target of AAF-cmk, its inhibition resulted in accumulations similar to those obtained with AAF-cmk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our results question the proposed role for TPPII as a prominent alternative to the proteasome in cellular proteolysis </plain></SENT>
