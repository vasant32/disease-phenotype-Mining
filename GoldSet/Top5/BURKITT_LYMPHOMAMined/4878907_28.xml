<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was noted that, in the course of IM, antibodies are formed which react in indirect immunofluorescence tests with membrane antigens of live cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> lines as well as from IM leukocyte cultures, including an autochthonous line in the case of one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sets of sera from IM patients were tested which included a serum collected weeks to years before <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the majority of these the pre-IM serum failed to react in membrane immunofluorescence (MIF) tests with any of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> cell lines employed, but in some cases the presera reacted with cells of some but not others of the lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Possible explanations for these discrepant results have been discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The antibodies involved in the MIF test are evidently distinct from those responsible for the EBV and heterophile reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximal MIF activity is attained long after the other two antibodies have reached maximal titers and antibodies to EBV and membrane antigens seem to persist for years whereas the heterophile reaction turns negative within a few months </plain></SENT>
