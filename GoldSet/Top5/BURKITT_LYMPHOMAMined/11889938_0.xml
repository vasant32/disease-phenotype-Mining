<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (LB), a very progressive malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, can now be cured by chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, protocols used currently by developed countries are costly and can cause problems of tolerance for underprivileged children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop a protocol of care for Malagasy children suffering from LB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study of the files of children aged under 15 aged years, hospitalised for LB with anatomo-pathological evidence, in the Antananarivo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Unit from October 1985 to June 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics, (paraclinical) investigations, treatment and responses to treatment were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 40 medical records included a LB anatomo-pathological evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of children was 7.5 years, with a sex ratio in favour of males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children were underweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maxillo-facial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> prevailed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other locations for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> had also been observed, both unique or immediately multiple </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients seem to have arrived at the hospital in the early stages of the disease, but lack of investigation probably introduced biases to the evaluation of these stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy, even though incomplete due to its cost, remained the main means of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Generally speaking, an immediate, favourable response was obtained, but the toxicity of chemotherapy, especially haematological toxicity, contributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall results indicated an immediate mortality rate of 22.5%, but there was loss of follow-up for many patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A specific protocol of LB care in Madagascar appears to be possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Such a protocol should be based on experience with treatments, and should take into account disease characteristics, the response of Malagasy children to the treatment, as well as the country's economic state </plain></SENT>
