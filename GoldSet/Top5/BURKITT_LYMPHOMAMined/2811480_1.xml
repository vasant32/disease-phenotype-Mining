<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus is rearranged in leukemic cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these patients, only cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> patients express mu chain protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown, however, that immunoglobulin heavy chain transcripts are expressed at levels similar to those found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these leukemic cell types and, in addition, some of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> with a more mature phenotype also express immunoglobulin light chain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, leukemic cells which had rearranged T cell receptor gamma chain genes were not found to express gamma chain transcripts, indicating that the transcription of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes in these cells may be regulated in a lineage-specific manner </plain></SENT>
