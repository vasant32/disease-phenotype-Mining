<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is little current insight into the natural history of childhood <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> or the timing of relevant mutational events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 gene fusion due to chromosomal translocation is frequently seen in the common form of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether this abnormality arises prenatally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified, by reverse-transcriptase PCR screening of blood or bone marrow, <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 fusion in 12 children, plus a pair of identical twins, aged 2-5 years from Italy and the UK, who had newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We amplified and sequenced the genomic <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 fusion gene with a long-distance inverse PCR method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primers were designed that could be used in short-range PCR to screen for patient-specific, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> clone-specific <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 genomic fusion sequences in neonatal blood spots from each child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: We initially identified <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 fusion sequences in blood spots from the identical twins, diagnosed with concordant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> at age 4 years, who shared a single or clonotypic <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 sequence that suggested prenatal origin in one twin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three children were excluded because control genes could not be amplified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the other nine patients, six had positive blood spots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blood spots that were classified as negative were uninformative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Our findings showed that childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> is frequently initiated by a chromosome translocation event in utero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Studies in identical twins show however that such an event is insufficient for clinical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and that a postnatal promotional event is also required </plain></SENT>
