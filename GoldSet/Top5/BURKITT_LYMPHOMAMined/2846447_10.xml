<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) is the only one of the EBNA proteins to have been implicated as an EBV-encoded transforming protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More detailed studies of this protein have been hampered by the lack of EBNA-2-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and of purified protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To overcome these problems, we isolated 5 hybridomas producing MAbs reactive with an 18 residue synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> corresponding to the carboxyterminus of EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of the 5 MAbs were specifically reactive with EBNA-2 in its denatured form on immunoblots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 5th antibody (115E) was reactive with the native form of EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By using a one-step immunoaffinity purification method with 115E cross-linked to protein-A-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi>, we purified EBNA-2 to homogeneity, i.e., more than 1,200-fold, from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A major 32-kDa associated protein and a less abundant 17-kDa protein were co-purified with EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation with 115E from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>-methionine-labelled cell extracts showed that the 32-kDa protein co-precipitated with EBNA-2 from EBV-positive cells, but was not detectable in immunoprecipitates of EBV-negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the immunoprecipitates or the purified proteins were immunoblotted with EBV-immune sera, only EBNA-2 was reactive, indicating that the associated proteins are of cellular origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation of cells labelled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>-orthophosphate showed that EBNA-2, but not the associated proteins, is a phosphoprotein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression level of EBNA-2 varied between different EBV-carrying cell lines, as measured by a 2-site ELISA based on antibody 115E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In indirect immunofluorescence, the 115E MAb gave an EBNA-2-specific characteristic granular staining pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These characteristics of EBNA-2 resemble those of other <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> transforming proteins </plain></SENT>
