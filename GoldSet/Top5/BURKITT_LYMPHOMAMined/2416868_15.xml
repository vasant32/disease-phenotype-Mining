<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human T <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines spontaneously release into their medium a suppressor lymphokine, T <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-derived suppressor lymphokine (TLSL), able to inhibit proliferation, DNA synthesis, and colony formation in a variety of malignant hemopoietic cell lines, as well as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myelomonocytic progenitor cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Titration curves indicated that the inhibitory activity in the crude supernatant preparations ranged from 10(-3)-10(-9): the supernatants from CCRF/CEM, HUT-78, and MOLT-4 cell lines were the most active, those from HPB-ALL, JM, and CCRF/HSB2 displayed an intermediate activity, and the Jurkat supernatant was the least active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Target cell lines of B cell origin (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) were more sensitive than granulocytic, monocytic, erythroid, and T cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Partial purification by <z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> precipitation and column chromatography demonstrated that TLSL is a protein with an Mr of 88,000, as determined by gel filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high Mr form (greater than 300,000) was produced in serum-free medium by one of the most active producer cell lines (CCRF/CEM), and appeared to be an aggregate of the 88,000 Mr form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither the partially purified fractions obtained nor the crude supernatant preparations displayed antiviral activity or contained interleukin 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike lymphotoxin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor, TLSL is <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi>: maximal inhibition of proliferation was observed 4-5 d after addition of crude supernatant to the target cells, and was not accompanied by a significant loss in cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The antiproliferative capacity of TLSL was manifested both in suspension and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treated target cells accumulated either in the G1 or in the S phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect of TLSL on the target cells is irreversible: even brief (1 h) incubation of sensitive cells with TLSL resulted in inhibition of proliferation measured 5 d later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although TLSL is produced by leukemic T cell lines, this lymphokine inhibits proliferation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood T cells in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> or alloantigens: T lymphocyte activation was inhibited by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the T cell supernatants tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when T cell lines were used as targets, no inhibition of proliferation was detected with two exceptions: the low producer Jurkat cell line was sensitive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the T cell-derived supernatants, and the intermediate producer CCRF/HSB2 cell line was sensitive only to the three most active supernatants, CCRF/CEM, MOLT-4, and HUT-78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The possible significance of TLSL and its relationship with other suppressor lymphokines previously described in other systems is discussed </plain></SENT>
