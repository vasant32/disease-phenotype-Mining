<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>P53 mutations have been identified in a progressively increasing number of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nuclear p53 protein is usually present in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells in minute concentrations, due to its short half-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> with p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> mutations show a higher nuclear protein concentration, detectable by immunohistological techniques, due to stabilization by complexing with other proteins such as heat-shock protein or <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of nuclear p53 protein detected by immunohistochemistry with the monoclonal antibody PAb 1801 were measured with the aid of an image analysis system in 83 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) and 13 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, as well as in 14 cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> thymus, reactive tonsils, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High levels of p53 protein (greater than 5 per cent of the cells) were present only in high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (in the proportion 13/55), with a peak incidence in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (5/8 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower levels (less than 5 per cent) of p53 protein were detected in low-grade B- and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, as well as in most of the cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, where p53 protein was selectively present in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 5/14 reactive tonsils or lymph nodes, occasional p53-positive cells were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a relationship between levels of p53 protein and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of NHL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
