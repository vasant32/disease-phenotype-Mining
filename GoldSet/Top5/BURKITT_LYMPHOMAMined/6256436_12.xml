<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Membrane Ig and insulin receptors were assayed in the EBV-negative Ramos <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line and its EBV-converted sublines by surface fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>125I-protein A-binding assay, immunoprecipitation, and insulin receptor assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The original Ramos line expressed surface IgM but not IgD and had a low concentration of insulin receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten of 10 converted lines expressed IgD and a variable but usually high insulin-binding capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular weight analysis of immunoprecipitated Ig showed the presence of 2 mu-chains and 2 delta-chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of each heavy chain type could be characterized as membrane Ig, whereas the other was cytoplasmic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antisera against the lambda-chain precipitated mu and delta heavy chains as well, indicating that the delta-chain expressed on the membrane of the EBV-converted Ramos lines is bound to the lambda light chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results show that the differentiation of a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line is not completely "frozen" and can be induced to change in a more "activated" direction by EBV conversion </plain></SENT>
