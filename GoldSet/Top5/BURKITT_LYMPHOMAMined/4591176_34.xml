<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study describes the presence of a receptor for fluid phase human C3 and C3b on Raji cell membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The binding of C3 and C3b was demonstrated indirectly by a fluoresceinated anti-C3 serum and directly by using radioiodinated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No other complement proteins or serum factors were needed to mediate binding of C3 and C3b to the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The possibility of enzymatic cleavage of C3 before or after its attachment on the cell membrane was ruled out by the demonstration of antigenically intact C3 on Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition and dissociation of Raji cell-EAC1423 rosettes by C3 and C3b indicated that both of these proteins bind to the same receptor site or closely associated receptor sites on Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>C3b-bearing Raji cells were immune adherence negative, indicating that C3b binding to the receptor is brought about through the immune adherence region of the molecule and not the C3d portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The C3 receptor on Raji cell membranes is uniformly distributed and can move on the membrane plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately 4 x 10(5) molecules of C3 or C3b bind per Raji cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The receptor had a higher affinity for C3 than C3b, as was shown by uptake experiments and inhibition of Raji cell-EAC1423 rosette formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Apart from the described receptor for C3 and C3b another specific receptor for C3b inactivator-cleaved C3b (C3d) bound to red cells was shown to be present on Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Raji cells cultured in medium containing fresh <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human serum and cobra venom factor were lysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained when C3b-bearing Raji cells were cultured in medium with fresh <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The lytic effect could be abolished by inactivating serum C3 proactivator (C3PA) and required C6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that C3b bound to the Raji cell membrane activates the complement system through the alternate pathway and results in membrane damage and cytolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that cell destruction by this mechanism may play an important role in vivo in controlling cell growth </plain></SENT>
