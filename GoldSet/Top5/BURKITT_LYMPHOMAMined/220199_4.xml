<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technique has now been applied to cell-surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> of different human hematopoietic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These lines included Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-carrying lymphoblastoid cell lines of presumed non-neoplastic origin, and malignant EBV-genome-positive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and EBV-negative non-Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral lymphocytes, both the lymphoblastoid type of cell lines and the different types of lines of proven malignant ancestry contained the fast-eluting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi> on their cell surface with very few exceptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is therefore concluded that (I) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1518171" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant conversion</z:e> of human lymphoid cell in vivo is commonly, but not obligatorily, associated with a specific change in the composition of the fucosyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi>, and (2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> of B lymphocytes does not lead only to the well-documented immortalization in vitro but also, as a rule, to the same type of alteration in fucosyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi> as was demonstrated for the neoplastic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It proved possible to distinguish several categories of hematopoietic cell lines due to the effect that pretreatment of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi> with neuraminidase or mild acid exerted on their subsequent chromatographic behavior </plain></SENT>
