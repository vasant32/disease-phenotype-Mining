<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines expressed intranuclear EBNA-1 as detected by anticomplement immunofluorescence and Western blot assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cell lines differed in the level of EBNA-1 expression and the size of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The internal major late promoter of adenovirus was efficient in directing the transcription of EBNA-1 in the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line BJAB, the murine T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Tikaut, RBL-5, EL-4 and in the mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> line MSWBS but was less efficient in Ramos, an EBV negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line, the human T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> line 1301TK and the P815-X2 mouse <z:mpath ids='MPATH_350'>mastocytoma</z:mpath> line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> transfected lines except MSWBS contained EBNA-1 in a truncated form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The truncated EBNA-1 polypeptide reacted with the conventional human antibody reagents in an EBNA specific fashion but failed to bind rabbit or human antibody directed against the glycine-alanine repeat sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MSWBS contained a truncated as well as a full size EBNA-1 polypeptide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It also reacted with antibody directed against the glycine-alanine repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the repeat sequence is regularly affected by the truncation </plain></SENT>
