<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and the classical non-specific cross-reacting antigens (NCAs) belong to the CEA gene family which is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis, CEA gene family members (CGMs) have only been reported on cells of myeloid and monocytic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed 62 childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (ALLs) and seven surface immunoglobulin positive (sig+) B-cell lines for the expression of the CEA family members CEA, NCA-50/90, NCA-95, NCA-160, CGM1 and CGM7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that members of the CEA family were present in 76% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALLs</z:e> of B- and T-cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In ALLs of B-cell origin, 82% of the samples expressed at least one CEA subgroup member: 38% NCA-50/90 (CD66c), 31% NCA-160 (CD66a), and 13% both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of seven B-cell lines solely expressed NCA-160 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In seven ALL of T-cell origin, sole NCA-160 expression was present in 29% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CEA and CGM1 were not expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALLs</z:e> or in the sIg+ B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 15 ALLs and seven B-cell lines which could be analyzed for CGM7 expression, the antigen was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NCA-95 was not expressed in 91% of the B-lineage ALLs, in T-lineage ALLs and in the B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, five B-lineage ALLs showed conflicting data on the binding patterns of two, on leukocytes specifically NCA-95 recognizing antibodies suggesting either expression of unknown forms of NCA-95 or NCA-50/90 or of a yet unknown member of the CEA family in these ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expression of CEA subgroup members in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> cells might have prognostic impacts, as an inverse correlation exists between NCA expression on leukemic blasts and the risk factor white blood count at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
