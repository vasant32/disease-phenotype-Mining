<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether abrogation of TRAIL <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is a feature in the genesis of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of GC-phenotype is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the integrity of the TRAIL pathway in Fas-resistant and Fas-sensitive Burkitt s <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Expression of TRAIL receptors was determined by flow cytometry and Western blots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> following exposure to TRAIL was measured by annexin-V/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> dual staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The integrity of the Fas and TRAIL apoptotic pathways was determined by Western blotting to assess cleavage of downstream caspases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analyses were used to determine the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and the profile of expression was correlated with response to TRAIL and CH11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> expresses both functional and decoy TRAIL receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> with a functional Fas pathway retained sensitivity to TRAIL: Frequent and compound loss of expression of pro-apoptotic proteins can be identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> resistant to Fas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, loss of Bax, Bak and Bcl-Xs did not compromise sensitivity to TRAIL: INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> frequently retain sensitivity to the TRAIL pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results underscore the utility of TRAIL-based therapeutic strategies in the treatment of those B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that may have compromised expression of several pro-apoptotic proteins </plain></SENT>
