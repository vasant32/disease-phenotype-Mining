<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human membrane cofactor protein (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>, CD46) is a receptor for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> virus and serves as a complement regulator which protects host cells from autologous complement attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> is highly polymorphic due to a variety of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splice products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> expression on T and myeloid cell lines are usually two-eightfold higher than those on their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts, whereas Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cell lines express less <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> than B cell lineages carrying no EB virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The molecule has a Ser/Thr-rich (ST) domain adjacent to the functional domain, namely short consensus repeats (SCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ST domain and a cytoplasmic tail (CYT) contribute to the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ST domain is encoded by three exons (A, B and C) and major ST isoforms are STABC, STBC and STC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the relationship between the expression levels and isoform usage of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> by flow cytometry using specific antibodies against STA and STC, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with size markers for each splice variant, and by RT-PCR/Southern blotting using a specific probe for STA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results were (1) the profiles of mean shifts of myeloid and T cell lines were STC &lt; STA on flow cytometry while those of B cell lines and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood cells were STA &lt; STC; (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines tested by RT-PCR expressed the messages for the isoforms STBC/CYT1, STC/CYT1, STBC/CYT2, and STC/CYT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The band for STABC/CYT2 overlapped that for STC/CYT1, and the band for STABC/CYT1 was marginal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines examined; (3) semi-quantitative analysis of the STABC isoforms by Southern blotting indicated the presence of high levels of the STABC messages in myeloid and T-cell lines in comparison with B lymphoid cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> leucocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the quantity of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> expressed parallels the STABC message level, which is up-regulated in T and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> cell lines </plain></SENT>
