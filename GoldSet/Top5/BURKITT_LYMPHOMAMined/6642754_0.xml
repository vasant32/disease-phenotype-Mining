<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its reactivity with antibodies from sera of patients with various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this presentation we describe the methods for further purification of GP40 from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radioiodinated purified GP40 was used in a double antibody precipitation assay, to measure the level of free anti-GP40 antibodies in sera of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies of patients at various stages of the disease revealed a close correlation between the level of free anti-GP40 antibodies and the stage of the disease, namely, low levels in advanced stages (C-D) and high levels in early stages (A-B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients in remission undergoing chemotherapy always had elevated levels of free antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, patients in relapse had decreasing levels of free antibodies </plain></SENT>
