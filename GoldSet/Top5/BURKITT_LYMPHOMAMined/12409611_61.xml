<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome has been detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of epithelial or mesenchymal origin such as nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100243'>leiomyosarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is little doubt that EBV can infect cells of numerous lineages in vivo, in contrast to its in vitro infectious spectrum, which appears restricted predominantly to B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show here that the EBV BALF4 gene product, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> gp110, dramatically enhances the ability of EBV to infect human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>gp110(high) viruses were up to 100 times more efficient than their gp110(low) counterparts in infecting lymphoid or epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, gp110(high) viruses infected the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line HeLa and the T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Molt-4, both previously thought to be refractory to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of several virus isolates showed that the amount of BALF4 present within mature virions markedly differed among these strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In some strains, gp110 was found expressed during lytic replication not only at the nuclear but also at the cellular membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heterologous expression of gp110 during the virus lytic phase neither altered virus concentration nor affected virus binding to cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It appears that gp110 plays a crucial role after the virus has adhered to its cellular target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>gp110 constitutes an important virulence factor that determines <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of non-B cells by EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the use of gp110(high) viruses will help to determine the range of the target cells of EBV beyond B lymphocytes and provide a useful in vitro model to assess the oncogenic potential of EBV in these cells </plain></SENT>
