<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic mutations in the perforin gene (PRF1) give rise to approximately 30% cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272199" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="FHL|FEL|HPLH1|FHLH|HPLH|HLH1">familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A frequent polymorphism, A91V (C to T transition at position 272), may impair processing of perforin protein to the active form, and has been suggested to increase susceptibility to childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of A91V in ALL, we genotyped 2272 children with de novo ALL registered on the Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group ALL Classification study P9900 and 655 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allele frequencies in the controls showed a very low frequency of the variant allele in blacks, 0.7% compared to 4% in white controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In light of this, analysis was restricted to a comparison of white cases and controls only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall genotype frequencies were similar in white ALL cases and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> white controls (P=0.58), indicating that in contrast to the previous report, A91V polymorphism is not associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PRF1 A91V frequency was significantly increased in children with BCR-ABL positive ALL (24 vs 8.5%; P=0.0048); however, this observation includes a relatively small number of cases and needs further exploration </plain></SENT>
