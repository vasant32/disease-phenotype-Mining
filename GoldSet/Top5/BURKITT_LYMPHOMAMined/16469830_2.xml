<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An immunohistochemical study was carried out on some of the most common kinds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> had serologically high levels of HbF as evaluated previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunoaffinity-purified anti-HbF was immunohistochemically used to study F cell distribution in the following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>: colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009551'>urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006118" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain tumours</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinoma</z:mp>, breast <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012114'>endometrial carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, HbF-containing red blood cells (FRBC) were present within thin-walled vessels or were disposed in dense clusters within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some of these cells were nucleated or binucleated HbF-erythroblasts or HbF-normoblasts (FNBS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two cases, high levels of mitoses within HbF-erythroblasts were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In half of the cases with transitional cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the urinary bladder, regional intratumoral blood vessels were found to contain 5-50% FRBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> examined, F cells were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FRBCs, however, were occasionally observed in the regional lymph nodes of some of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of HbF as a potential plasma marker is suggested by the high concentration of FRBCs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The apparent development of FRBCs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumour</z:e> tissues is an interesting observation, as these cells were previously thought to develop in medullary or lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is thus suggested that the colonic microenvironment may stimulate extramedullary fetal-type haematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
