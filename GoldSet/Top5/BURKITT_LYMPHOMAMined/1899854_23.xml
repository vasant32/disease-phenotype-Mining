<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>HLA class-I expression has been investigated by biochemical methods in 14 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines and the corresponding Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) derived from the same individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Selective down-regulation of one or more HLA class-I specificities was demonstrated in 9 out of 14 BL lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The defect was restricted to a single HLA-A allele in 3 of the lines (BL29, BL72, WW-I-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four lines (BL28, BL37, BL41 and Jijoye M13) showed down-regulation of both HLA-A and -C alleles, and one (BL36) failed to express one HLA-C allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line (WW-2-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) had lost one HLA-A and one HLA-B allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The allele-specific defects were mainly detected in cell lines that had maintained the phenotypic characteristics of the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of B-cell activation markers and the EBV-encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA)-2 correlated with up-regulation of the Cw4 allele in the P79 subline of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line Jijoye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with gamma-interferon (IFN) resulted in full or partial reversion of the HLA class-I defects in some of the cases but had no significant effect in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was not due to a cell-line-related unresponsiveness to IFN, nor did it reflect an allele-specific mode of regulation because the same allele could respond differently in different cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that defective expression of HLA class-I antigens, which appears to be more prevalent for alleles within the HLA-A and -C loci, is a common feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Different regulatory mechanisms appear to be involved </plain></SENT>
