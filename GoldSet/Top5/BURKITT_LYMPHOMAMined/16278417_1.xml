<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of a high affinity, rapidly internalizing anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody for selectively delivering high-energy (90)Y radioactivity to B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antibody, RFB4, was readily labeled with (90)Y using the highly stable chelate, 1B4M-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Labeled RFB4 selectively bound to the CD22(+) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Daudi, but not to CD22(-) control cells in vitro as compared with a control antibody, and was more significantly bound (P = 0.03) to Daudi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> growing in athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biodistribution data correlated well with the antitumor effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effect of (90)Y-labeled anti-CD22 (Y22) was dose-dependent, irreversible, and the best results were achieved in mice receiving a single i.p. dose of 196 microCi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These mice displayed a significantly better (P &lt; 0.01) antitumor response than control mice and survived &gt;200 days with no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histology studies showed no significant injury to kidney, liver, or small intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing mice treated with Y22 had no radiologic bone marrow damage compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing mice treated with the control-labeled antibody arguing that the presence of CD22(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> protected mice from bone marrow damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When anti-CD22 radioimmunotherapy was compared to radioimmunotherapy with anti-CD19 and anti-CD45 antibodies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three antibodies distributed significantly high levels of radioisotope to flank <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in vivo compared with controls (P &lt; 0.05), induced complete remission, and produced long-term, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that anti-CD22 radioimmunotherapy with Y22 is highly effective in vivo against CD22-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and may be a useful therapy for drug-refractory B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
