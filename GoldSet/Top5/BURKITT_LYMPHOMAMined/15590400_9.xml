<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene coding for NQO1 is subject to a genetic polymorphism at nucleotide position 609 (C--&gt;T) of the human NQO1 cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous individuals (C/T) have intermediate activity and homozygotes for the variant allele (T/T) are deficient in NQO1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, genotypes conferring lower NQO1 activity have been associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, particularly infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> carrying MLL/AF4 fusion genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated this association in our population and extended the analysis to other subgroups of pediatric hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> characterized by specific fusion genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 138 patients with childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) carrying distinct fusion genes (MLL/AF4=35; BCR/ABL=31; <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>/AML1=72), 71 cases of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 190 healthy control individuals for the NQO1 C609T polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When compared to the healthy control group, only children with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> significantly more often had NQO1 genotypes associated with lower NQO1 activity (odds ratio, 1.81; p=0.036), predominantly at a younger age (&lt; 9 years at diagnosis: odds ratio, 3.02; p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in our population the NQO1 C609T polymorphism does not confer an increased risk of the investigated entities of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there may be a modulating role for NQO1 in the pathogenesis of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
