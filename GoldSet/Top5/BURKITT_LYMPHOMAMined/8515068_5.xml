<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The deregulation of the c-myc gene in small non-cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (SNCL) with 8;14 translocations is thought to be due to the juxtaposition of this gene with the IgH chain locus, but exactly how the Ig locus contributes to the deregulation is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One widely considered hypothesis is that Ig gene enhancers, when moved near c-myc, might stimulate inappropriate transcription of this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate this hypothesis, we have tested the ability of the two known H chain enhancers, the JH-C mu intronic enhancer and the 3' alpha enhancer, to support transcription from c-myc promoters, by using transient transfection assays in a panel of 32 SNCL cell lines with 8;14 translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activity of the JH-C mu intronic enhancer varied widely among the cell lines tested and correlated with the presence of nuclear factors binding to the E4/octamer regions of the enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3' alpha enhancer was much less active than the intronic enhancer in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of our cell lines and seems unlikely to account for the c-myc deregulation (although the enhancer we tested was from the rat, because the human homologue is unidentified at present) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A marked difference was also seen in the ability of individual cell lines to support transcription from the unenhanced c-myc constructs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell lines supporting the lowest enhancer activity tended to support the highest level of transcription from unenhanced c-myc promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences in transcription from c-myc promoters were confirmed by stably transfecting constructs containing c-myc promoters in SNCL cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data strongly suggest that the importance of Ig enhancers for c-myc deregulation varies markedly in different cell lines and that, for many, trans-acting regulators of the c-myc promoters are as important or more important, than Ig enhancers in the deregulation of the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
