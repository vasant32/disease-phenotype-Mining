<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LB), a frequent, very progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with multiple factors, can be cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mortality rate remains high in Madagascar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyse the epidemiological aspects of LB as well as related socio-economical issues in order to improve successful treatment of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective study of files for children aged under 15 years, hospitalised for LB in the Antananarivo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> unit from October 1985 to June 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inclusion criteria were anatomo-pathological, clinical and/or X-ray results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studied parameters included age, sex, ethnic group, medical history, and the distance covered by the child before his/her hospitalisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The 77 cases of LB represented 16% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children aged under 15 years seen in the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of the cases corresponded to those of African endemic LB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of the children with LB came from areas with endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e>, the Eastern and the Centre of Madagascar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them belonged to underprivileged families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early medical advice was sought but distance from services delayed treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Various units referred the children, but especially oral surgeons (stomatologists) and ORL physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A strategy to ensure rapid treatment for children suffering from LB should be developed, from their region of origin up until treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This should involve parents as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members of the medical staff in charge of these children </plain></SENT>
