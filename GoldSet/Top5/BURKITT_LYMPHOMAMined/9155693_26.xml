<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sections of biopsy specimens from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases entered into the trial were stained with Giemsa and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were stained immunohistochemically for CD45, CD3, CD45RO, CD20, and CD30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sections were stained with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35682">naphthol</z:chebi> AS-D chloroacetate esterase or KP1 (CD68) to identify granulocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a minority of cases, additional immunohistochemical stains were performed when necessary to establish the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sections were reviewed by three pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 308 cases analysed, 293 were categorised as NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was only one case of low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over 80% of the cases fell into the categories Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (42.2%), lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (27.2%) and anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (15.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cases of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> presented most often with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">abdominal tumours</z:e> mainly of the ileocaecal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029295" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumours of the oropharynx</z:e> and nasopharynx were also common in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 84 lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 56 were of the T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, 12 of the B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> and 16 of indeterminate lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most of the T-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed mediastinal or pleural involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Infiltration of the skin and soft tissues was seen in 25% of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of B or indeterminate phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Forty six children were diagnosed as having anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the majority being of T or indeterminate lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Most patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> but involvement of the bones, soft tissues or skin was seen in seven patients and of the mediastinum and lungs in five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Childhood non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> high grade and frequently extranodal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>They fall mainly into the categories Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The separation of these subcategories can be made on the basis of <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunohistochemical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The anatomical distribution of these different categories of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is distinctive </plain></SENT>
