<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>IL-4 is known to induce a 1.8 kb constant epsilon (C) transcript in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a C germline or '<z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp>' transcript which is encoded by a germline exon (I) located 5' of the epsilon switch (S) region and the four C germline exon including 3' untranslated region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the human B cell lines examined, one Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cell line, DND39 (Epstein-Barr virus negative, sIgM+, CD40+), was found to respond to IL-4 and express the C germline transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Induction of C germline transcript in DND39 cells was entirely dependent on the presence of IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">Phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> enhanced its expression in DND39 cells as well as in the purified B cells in combination with IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> (PWM) enhanced the expression of C germline transcripts induced by IL-4 in PBMC but the enhancing activity was not observed when purified B cells or DND39 cells were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Supernatants obtained from PWM-stimulated PBMC strongly enhanced the expression of C germline transcript in DND39 cells when co-stimulated with IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the known cytokines tested mimicked this effect, suggesting that PWM may induce in T cells or monocytes a novel cytokine production that works synergistically with IL-4 and enhances the expression of IL-4-induced C germline transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar enhancing effect was observed when anti-CD40 mAb was added to the IL-4-stimulated DND39 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, transforming growth factor-beta strongly suppressed it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, DND39 cells resemble <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells in terms to responsiveness to IL-4 and should be a useful tool to study the molecular mechanisms of regulation of C germline transcription and class switching to IgE </plain></SENT>
