<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intact, but not disintegrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells induced resistance to VSV in human embryonic kidney, amnion and diploid, as well as in green monkey kidney cells employed as feeder layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A line of rabbit kidney or Earle's strain L cells was not protected under similar conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Depending upon the number of EB2 cells initially transferred, resistance developed within 1 day or in more than 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cell-free media collected from cultures of EB2 cells in the presence or absence of feeder layers of human cells were capable of conferring rapid protection against VSV to human-cell cultures but not to L cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The protective principle complies with present criteria for an interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results are compatible with the suggestion that EB2 cultures are latently infected with an as yet unidentified virus </plain></SENT>
