<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human neutrophils incubated with the anti-HLA-DR mAb Lym-1, plus <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>, induced significant cytolysis of B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells compared with Lym-1 and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> was independent of the ability of the compound to stimulate neutrophil-respiratory burst </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In fact, first, neutrophils from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740451" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">granulomatous disease</z:e> were cytolytically effective in spite of their inability to produce oxidants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, various kinase inhibitors exerted different effects on the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-stimulated cytolytic system and neutrophil-oxidative burst </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown the involvement of the FcgammaRII, CD11b-CD18 integrins, and CD66b <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> in the Lym-1 mAb-dependent cytolysis by GM-CSF-stimulated neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-stimulated system was inhibited by the anti-FcgammaRII mAb IV.3, the anti-CD18 mAb MEM 48, and the anti-CD11b mAb 2LPM19c but not by the anti-CD66b mAb 80H3 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17411">N-acetyl-D-glucosamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>- and GM-CSF-stimulated cytolysis was insensitive and sensitive to inhibition by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pertussis</z:e> toxin, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> and GMCSF as neutrophil stimulants uncovers the existence of distinct mechanisms of Lym-1 mAb-mediated cytolysis </plain></SENT>
