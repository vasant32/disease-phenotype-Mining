<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the factors that determine the differing growth requirements of low-iron-tolerant (LIT) versus high-iron-dependent (HID) cells for extracellular nontransferrin iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The growth of LIT cells HeLa and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1, when transferred from transferrin (5 micrograms/ml) medium into low-iron (5 microM ferric <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi>) medium, was not significantly affected while HID cells Jiyoye and K562 showed nearly no growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HeLa and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells, as well as Jiyoye and K562 cells, do not produce transferrin in sufficient amounts to support their growth in low-iron medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, similar rates of iron uptake in low-iron medium (0.033 and 0.032 nmol Fe/min and 10(6) cells) were found for LIT cells HeLa and HID cells K562 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the intracellular iron level (4.64 nmol/10(6) cells) of HeLa cells grown in low-iron medium was much higher than iron levels (0.15 or 0.20 nmol/10(6) cells) of HeLa or K562 cells grown in transferrin medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the activity (ratio activated/total) of the iron regulatory protein (IRP) in HID cells Jiyoye and K562 increased more than twofold (from 0.32 to 0.79 and from 0.47 to 1.12, respectively) within 48 h after their transfer into low-iron medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the case of LIT cells HeLa and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1, IRP activity stayed at similar or slightly decreased levels (0.86-0.73 and 0.58-0.55, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Addition of iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> (50 microM, i.e., about half-maximal growth-inhibitory dose) resulted in significantly increased activity of IRP also in HeLa and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the relatively higher bioavailability of nontransferrin iron in LIT cells, over that in HID cells, determines the differing responses observed under low-iron conditions </plain></SENT>
