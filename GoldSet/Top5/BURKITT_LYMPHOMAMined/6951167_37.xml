<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With this system we have examined the production of the HLA-A,B,C antigens, A human-mouse somatic cell hybrid was constructed which contained a human X-7 chromosome translocation carrying the HLA region; this hybrid was used as a donor of the X-6 translocation in the technique of microcell transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The X-6 chromosome recipient was the mouse embryonal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line PCC4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The microcell hybrid <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-6 retained the embryonal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> phenotype as judged by shape and absence of H-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the expression of the HLA-A,B,C genes was not extinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HLA-A,B,C antigen production of the cell surface, however, was not detected because this hybrid apparently could not make beta 2-microglobulin </plain></SENT>
