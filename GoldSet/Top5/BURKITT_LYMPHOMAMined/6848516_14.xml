<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thymidylate synthase-negative mutants of mouse FM3A cells were transformed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> prototrophs by human DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The stable transformants had only human thymidylate synthase and segments of human DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They grew normally but had unusually high levels of the human enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two transformants examined, however, neither was the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18077">dTTP</z:chebi> pool elevated nor the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16311">dCTP</z:chebi> pool decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA synthesis in permeabilized cells of a transformant was more efficient than that in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16284">dATP</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16497">dGTP</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16311">dCTP</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17622">dUMP</z:chebi> as substrates, but this was not so when <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17622">dUMP</z:chebi> was replaced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18077">dTTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike the mouse enzyme, the human enzyme in the transformants did not co-sediment with DNA polymerase alpha and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase in a <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> gradient, suggesting that the human enzyme is not incorporated into a multienzyme complex for DNA replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high levels of the human enzyme in the transformants were suppressed to various degrees by fusion with a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mouse line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No active hybrid dimer enzyme was found between the human and mouse enzymes, which each consist of two identical subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the human enzyme in the transformants seems to behave differently from the mouse enzyme and its overproduction seems to be necessary for supporting the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth of the transformants </plain></SENT>
