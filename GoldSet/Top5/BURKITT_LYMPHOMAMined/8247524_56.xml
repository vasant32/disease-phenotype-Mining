<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>c-Myc is phosphorylated at multiple sites in vivo, two of which we have identified near the amino terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In chicken Thr-61/Ser-65 are phosphorylated, as are the comparable positions, Thr-58/Ser-62 in human c-Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These residues are located within a domain that is implicated in transactivation and is important for the transforming potential of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these phosphorylation sites or nearby amino acids are frequently mutated in v-myc and in several c-myc genes from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro these two phosphorylation sites can be modified by <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> activated protein kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To address their biological importance we mutated these amino terminal phosphorylation sites separately and together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stably transfected Rat1A cells expressing the mutated proteins have an increased growth potential in soft agar compared to wt-c-myc transfectants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These altered transformation characteristics indicate that Myc function may be negatively regulated by the amino terminal phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
