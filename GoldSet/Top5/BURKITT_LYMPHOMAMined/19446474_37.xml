<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because presently known miRNAs have been identified by virtue of their abundant expression in a few cell types, many tissue-specific miRNAs remain unrevealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand the role of miRNAs in B cell function and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, we generated short-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> libraries from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B cells at different stages of development (naive, germinal center, memory) and from a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A combination of cloning and computational analysis identified 178 miRNAs (miRNome) expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and/or transformed B cell libraries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most notably, the B cell miRNome included 75 miRNAs which to our knowledge have not been previously reported and of which 66 have been validated by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> blot and/or RT-PCR analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Numerous miRNAs were expressed in a stage- or transformation-specific fashion in B cells, suggesting specific functional or pathologic roles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results provide a resource for studying the role of miRNAs in B cell development, immune function, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
