<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Set of 3-, 4-combination of monoclonal antibodies was used for exact definition of immunophenotypic characteristics of B-cells populations from healthy donors and aberrant, asynchronous, over/under-expressed phenotypes and detection changes in intensity expression of markers that characterized pathological leukemic B-cells at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These differences in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal cell patterns were very important and could be utilized for analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these findings we were able to clearly distinguish residual leukemic cells from hematogones (healthy B-lymphocyte precursors) too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also verified that in some cases the CD58 marker is overexpressed on CD10+, CD34+ blast cells at diagnosis and can be feasible used for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
