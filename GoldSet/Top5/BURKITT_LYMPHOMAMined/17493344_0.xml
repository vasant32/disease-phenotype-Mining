<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood dendritic cell (DC) subsets of patients and healthy controls were detected by flow cytometry, and the correlations between reconstitution of DC and cGVHD, relapse were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that compared with healthy subjects, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> had a significantly decreased proportion and absolute number of myeloid dendritic cell (MDC), MDC1, DC and the ratio of MDC/PDC (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were not statistically different in MDC2 and PDC between patients and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After transplant, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the proportion of WBC and absolute numbers of DC reached to healthy controls levels at 9 months (P&gt;0.05), besides the proportion of PDC which reached to healthy controls levels at 1 year (P=0.494) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with levels before relapse, the proportions of MDC1, MDC, DC and the ratio of MDC/PDC were lower, but proportions of MDC2 and PDC were slightly higher after relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with a 'high' PDC recovery profile had an improved cumulative incidence of cGVHD in contrast to patients with a 'low' PDC recovery profile on day 120 after transplantation (P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that compared with healthy subjects, de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients have a significantly decreased proportion and absolute number of DC and the ratio of MDC/PDC before haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; while ratio of MDC/PDC can be normalized with relative rapidity, the proportions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> DC subsets reached to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels on the whole at 9 months after transplantation, and also recovery level of DCs is correlated with occurrence of cGVHD and relapse </plain></SENT>
