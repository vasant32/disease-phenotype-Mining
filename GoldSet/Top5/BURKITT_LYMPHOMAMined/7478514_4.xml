<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies indicate that the rat B-myc gene contains a single exon which shows 77% nucleotide homology to the second exon of the rat c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its open reading frame (ORF) encodes a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> with a predicted molecular weight of 20 kD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have isolated a new, larger rat B-myc genomic clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of this clone confirmed the presence of one single coding exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a genomic mouse B-myc clone was identified and compared to the rat homolog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide analysis of B-myc coding and non-coding sequences suggests that it may be a functional gene evolved by selective duplication of part of the second c-myc exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the rodent B-myc open reading frames revealed two in-frame amino acid duplications in mouse B-myc and a 96% conservation at the amino acid level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both rat and mouse B-myc proteins contain an identical and unique stretch of 14 carboxy terminal amino acid residues not found in other myc proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vitro translation of rat and mouse B-myc ORF's yielded proteins that migrated as 26 kD bands in <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE and could be immunoprecipitated by a polyclonal panmyc antiserum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells transiently transfected with a B-myc expression vector showed that the protein was mainly localized to the nucleus </plain></SENT>
