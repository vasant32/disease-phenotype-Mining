<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> was shown to enhance EAC14oxy23b rosette formation with Raji lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This provided a specific and sensitive test to detect the solubilized C3b receptor either in crude or highly purified form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The property of the C3b receptor tested by this assay appears to be analogous to properties of beta 1H </plain></SENT>
