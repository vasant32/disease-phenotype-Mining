<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the relationship between cell surface sialylation and the adhesive properties of two clones (3G3 and 3D2) of a human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-8 to extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By flow cytometric analysis we found that the cell surface of 3G3 clone was highly sialylated and that of the 3D2 clone were hyposialylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cell surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> content was significantly greater in the 3G3 clone than in the 3D2 clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> assays showed that cell surface sialylation in the 3G3 clone cells might reduce their attachment to collagen type IV and fibronectin, compared to 3D2 clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">Sialic acid</z:chebi> metabolic complementation assays using several precursors of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> suggested that hyposialylation in the 3D2 clone resulted from low activities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi>-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-GlcNAc2-epimerase) which is a key enzyme in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From RT-PCR analysis the expression of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-GlcNAc2-epimerase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was found to be correlated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> content in the two clones of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, expression of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-GlcNAc2-epimerase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> may regulate the expression of sialoglycoconjugates which affect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to collagen type IV and fibronectin </plain></SENT>
