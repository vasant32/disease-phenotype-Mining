<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow hematogones (benign B-lymphocyte precursors) may cause diagnostic problems due to their morphologic and immunophenotypic similarities with neoplastic lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematogone populations in presented study containing 358 bone marrow specimens of 251 individuals always exhibited a continuous and complete maturation spectrum of antigen expression typical for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> evolution of B-lineage precursors; lacking aberrant or asynchronous antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast lymphoblasts of 19 bone marrows of precursors <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> patients showed maturation arrest and exhibited several immunophenotypic aberrancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hematogones were identified by 4-color flow cytometry using optimal antibody combinations in many bone marrow samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were more commonly found in higher numbers in children, and there was found a general decline in hematogones with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow hematogones were separately assessed as hematogones 1 population of early stage and hematogones 2 of mid-stage precursor B-cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In some (about 30%) of hematogones a third type hematogones could be assessed in bone marrow samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This small B-cell subpopulation was defined by CD10-positivity, coexpressing more mature markers CD19,CD20,CD22 and CD45bright </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These cells obviously blended with those of mature B-lymphocytes (CD10-negative) on CD45/SSC, and could be better recognized on CD10-gating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Quantitative immunophenotyping of this study completed the percent antigen expression data in two main hematogone subtypes and lymphocytes in 16 bone marrow specimens and precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> lymphoblasts in some samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased information on benign B-lymphocyte precursors, especially that of existence of the 3rd type hematogones could provide a basis for better discrimination of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells even in a very small amounts </plain></SENT>
