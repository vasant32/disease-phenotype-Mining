<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 50 children, 8 had no cytogenetic examination of the marrow at the time of diagnosis and 7 had a poor yield from the marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of the remaining children had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rest of the children had hyperdiploidy and structural chromosomal abnormalities (mainly translocation and deletions) in equal proportions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality of the whole group was about 26% with 2 lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 2 patients who relapsed while on treatment of whom 1 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic abnormalities were correlated with clinical variables known to have prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The group with hyperdiploidy had a significantly lower mean total white count at presentation and none of them died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The group with translocation abnormalities had a lower mean platelet count at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the group with hyperdiploidy and a great majority of the other 2 groups with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or structural cytogenetic abnormalities were of B cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median survival times for the hyperdiploid, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and translocation patients were 1800 days, 1450 days and 700 days respectively </plain></SENT>
