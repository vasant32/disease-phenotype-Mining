<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess complete remission (CR) and survival in patients with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ARL) receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the <z:chebi fb="25" ids="24433">Grupo</z:chebi> de Estudio del SIDA register of systemic ARL, which started in Jan 1994, to collect cases diagnosed at 15 institutions prospectively and with active follow-up every 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The date of censorship for this study was March 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 210 consecutive patients were diagnosed with ARL, with a median age 39 of years, 75.7% of whom were male, and with a median baseline CD4 count of 160 cells/microL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologic subtypes were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL; n = 153 [72.9%]), Burkitt and atypical Burkitt/Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>; n = 40 [19.0%]), T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (TC; n = 8 [3.8%]), and miscellaneous (n = 9 [4.3%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy with or without other modalities was administered to 186 (88.6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an intent-to-treat analysis of 184 patients who received at least 1 chemotherapy course with adequate follow-up to assess their response, 119 (64.7%) achieved CR, and the median length of survival (Kaplan-Meier analysis) was 52 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23 to 82 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factors independently associated with CR were histologic subtype and International Prognostic Index (IPI) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors independently associated with improved overall length of survival (OS) were CR, low IPI score, and histologic subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The single factor independently associated with disease-free survival was Ann Arbor stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ARL treated with HAART, CR was associated exclusively with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-related factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CR rate was poorer in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and TC subtypes and was inversely correlated with IPI score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>OS was independently associated with CR, IPI score, and the histologic subtype </plain></SENT>
