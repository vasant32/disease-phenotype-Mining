<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that an elongation of the IFN-beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> could be detected in virus-infected cells and that such a modification was not observed when the IFN-beta transcript was induced by a nonviral agent, poly(I-C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the cells with a transcriptional inhibitor (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> or 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole) resulted in further elongation of the transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characterization of the elongated IFN-beta transcript by primer extension and RNase H treatment showed that the modification was a result of an elongated poly(A) tail of up to 400 nucleotides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the poly(A) tail elongation of the IFN-beta transcript is associated with the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the presence of the elongated IFN-beta transcript correlated with a decrease of IFN-beta protein in the medium and in cell extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">Sucrose</z:chebi> gradient analysis of cytoplasmic extracts showed that IFN-beta transcripts with elongated poly(A) tails were found in the nonpolysomal fractions, whereas the shorter transcripts could be detected in both polysomal and nonpolysomal fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A longer form of the IFN-beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was also found in the nonpolysomal fractions of cells not treated with transcriptional inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the observed regulation of IFN-beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is not entirely dependent on the inhibition of transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this study provides the first example of a poly(A) tail elongation in somatic cells that negatively influences gene expression in vivo </plain></SENT>
