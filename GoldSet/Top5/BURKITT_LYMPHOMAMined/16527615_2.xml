<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally to other chromosome changes, a three-break rearrangement involving 6p21, 8q24, and 14q32, as well as cryptic translocations of IGH locus to MYC locus were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first case with colocalizations of MYC and IGH in a three-break rearrangement involving 6p21 and on an additional derivative chromosome as results of cryptic translocations </plain></SENT>
