<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have produced frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regressions</z:mp> and remissions, but it has been difficult to determine to what extent these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> responses have been due to antibody-specific targeted radiation, nontargeted radiation, and/or cytotoxicity mediated by the carrier monoclonal antibody (MoAb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, RIT was studied in athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice bearing s.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Raji human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> xenografts using two different pan-B-cell MoAbs, MB-1 (anti-CD37) and anti-B1 (anti-CD20), which differ in isotype (and thus the potential for interaction with host effector mechanisms) and isotype-matched control antibodies either in the unlabeled state or labeled with 131I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When a single i.p. injection of 300 microCi 131I-labeled MB-1 (IgG1) was compared to treatment with unlabeled MB-1 or 300 microCi 131I-labeled MYS control IgG1 MoAb, an antibody-specific targeted radiation effect of RIT was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>131I-labeled MB-1 produced a 44 +/- 19% (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size at 3 weeks posttreatment, while unlabeled MB-1 or 300 microCi 131I-labeled MYS control IgG1 antibody treatment resulted in continued <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> over this period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies demonstrated that MB-1 was incapable of mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity using Raji <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell targets and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar to the MB-1 studies, treatment with 300 microCi 131I-labeled anti-B1 produced a 64% reduction in mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, while 300 microCi of control antibody resulted in a 58% increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size over the same 3-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to MB-1, however, unlabeled anti-B1 (an IgG2a MoAb which in vitro studies showed to be capable of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity) also had a substantial antitumor effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, 300 microCi 131I-labeled anti-B1 and unlabeled anti-B1 treatment (using an equivalent amount of total protein in the treatment dose) produced a similar specific reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increasing the radionuclide dose of anti-B1 to 450 microCi in another experiment did not produce a significant difference in <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> compared to a 300-microCi dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the antitumor effects of 131I-labeled anti-B1 treatment were dominated by antibody-mediated cytotoxicity mechanisms, such that an antibody-specific targeted radiation effect could not be distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, antibody-specific targeting of radiation was the dominant mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> killing with 131I-labeled MB-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
