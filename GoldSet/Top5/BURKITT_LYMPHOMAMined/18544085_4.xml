<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic monoclonal antibody rituximab has previously been shown to kill B cells in a caspase-independent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The signalling pathways underpinning this novel <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathway are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study showed that rituximab treatment of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines induced a slow rise in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This rise was only witnessed in cell lines that were killed by antibody, suggesting a critical role for Ca(2+) in mediating rituximab-driven caspase-independent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the two main intracellular store-located Ca(2+) channels, i.e. the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi>-1,4,5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> receptor channels by dantrolene and xestospongen-c respectively did not prevent the rise in Ca(2+) seen with rituximab or protect cells from subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In sharp contrast, inhibition of Ca(2+) entry via plasma membrane channels with (2-aminoethoxy) diphenylborate or SKF-96365 or complete chelation of extracellular Ca(2+) with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30742">ethyleneglycol</z:chebi> bis (aminoethylether) tetra-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> inhibited the rise in [Ca(2+)](i) and increased cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, these data suggest that ligation of the CD20 receptor with rituximab allows a slow sustained influx of Ca(2+) from the external environment that under certain conditions can lead to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
