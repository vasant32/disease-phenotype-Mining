<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients (median age 35 years) with undifferentiated malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were collected over a 4 year period (1984-1988) and entered into a phase III protocol done under the auspices of the Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (ECOG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients who had their diagnosis made at surgery and had resection of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> were excluded from analysis of response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of the patients had Stage IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had marrow involvement and five had central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the patients received <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 45 patients evaluated for response showed a response rate of 67% (30/45) and a complete response rate of 40% (18/45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen responders continue disease-free with a median follow-up of &gt; 40 months and have an estimated 5 year survival of 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only two treatment related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were reported for the entire group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with undifferentiated non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had a longer survival than those with undifferentiated Burkitt's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We concluded that adult patients with undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> could be treated successfully with an aggressive multi-drug chemotherapy regimen, consisting of multiple alternating cycles of non-crossed-resistant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Toxicity with this aggressive prolonged regimen was acceptable </plain></SENT>
