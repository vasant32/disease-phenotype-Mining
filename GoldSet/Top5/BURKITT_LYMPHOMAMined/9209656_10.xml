<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However EBV is not detectable in 100% of cases using standard staining techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It still remains an open question whether in these EBV-negative cases EBV has never infected the cell, whether it has infected the cell and escapes conventional screening methods, or whether it has been lost again after initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The physical status of EBV in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BL60-P7 as well as in three somatic cell hybrids between BL60-P7 and its autologous EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell line IARC 277 was analyzed using conventional cytogenetics, Southern blotting, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Integration of EBV into the host genome of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BL60-P7 leads to an achromatic gap which causes a 'vulnerable site' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In hybrid cells, loss of integrated EBV, together with an adjacent chromosomal fragment, occurs during long-term cultivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The integrated EBV genome, including genes encoding for LMP and EBER, is partly deleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We assume that integration of EBV into the host cell genome could be a more common event in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Partially deleted EBV might escape standard detection assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The integration might constitute a chromosomal region prone to break events akin to the phenomenon of fragile sites, leading to the loss of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA as well as chromosomal DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This observation makes it tempting to speculate that under certain conditions EBV can act in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> by a so-called hit-and-run mechanism </plain></SENT>
