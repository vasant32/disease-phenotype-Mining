<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of in vitro runoff replication of forks initiated in intact cells, we found that transcribed c-myc genes in the germ line configuration in HeLa cells were replicated in the direction of transcription from origins in the 5'-flanking DNA, while the repressed, unrearranged c-myc genes of CA46 and ST486 cells were replicated in the antitranscriptional direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the transcribed c-myc genes of CA46 cells were replicated in the transcriptional direction, while the translocated, amplified c-myc genes of ST486 cells showed no preferred polarity of replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data also provided evidence for the existence of an endogenous barrier to DNA polymerases in the flanking DNA immediately 5' to the HeLa c-myc genes </plain></SENT>
