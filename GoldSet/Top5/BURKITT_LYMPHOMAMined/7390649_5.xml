<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous analyses in East Africa had produced conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Knox method used in those analyses dichotomizes the space and time scales and does not take into account the degree of closeness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Mantel method, a generalization of Knox's, does permit closeness between pairs of cases to enter into computations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To see whether this method could clarify matters, previously reported data sets from West Nile, Uganda and North Mara were reanalysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unexplained differences were found between West Nile and North Mara with respect to age, sex and temporal distributions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, and between the eastern and western parts of North Mara with respect to incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In West Nile between 1961 and 1965, there was clustering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the Mantel analyses and a few of the Knox analyses were highly significant (p less than 0.0025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since 1966, evidence of clustering is weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In North Mara, there was no statistical evidence of space-time clustering between 1971 and 1977, as there was none between 1964 and 1970 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The conflicting results in East Africa are compatible with a model involving several factors which "move about", or with a single factor which is <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> in some areas but constant in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, artifactual biases or coincidence may have created or wiped out the appearance of clustering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results of space-time clustering analyses permit little discrimination between infectious and non-infectious etiologic hypotheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Either one type or both may be operating </plain></SENT>
