<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association of EBV with this disease varies greatly from series to series and from country to country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies have shown differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> occurring in different parts of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, it has been reported that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> in developing countries differs from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> in Western countries in terms of epidemiological, pathological and clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These discrepancies among populations suggest an interaction with environmental factors and a direct role of different etiological agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At present, there are no data on the frequency of association of EBV with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> in equatorial Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, a large series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> cases have been collected at the University of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Nairobi</z:e>, Kenya, and at the Universities of Bologna and Siena, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cases have been reviewed and classified according to the REAL Classification and the presence of EBV has been assessed by in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A statistical difference in EBV expression was found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> from Kenya and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> from Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EBV-positive neoplastic cells were detected in 92% of Kenyan cases, whereas only 48% of Italian cases showed EBER1/2 positivity in the neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that, in Kenya, EBV plays a more direct role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, as it does for endemic Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
