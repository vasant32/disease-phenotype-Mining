<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The distinction between Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) is not always easy, so much so that the WHO 2008 Blue Book has incorporated a provisional category of "B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, unclassifiable with features intermediate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>." One of the immunohistochemical (IHC) markers used at times to differentiate between the two is IHC expression of BCL2, which was initially believed to be consistently negative in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Later it was recognized that weak BCL2 expression is still compatible with the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To verify or otherwise this current view this study was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved 39 confirmed cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, in both children and adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these cases had typical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, IHC profile, and Mib-1 index that are typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these cases were then stained with a monoclonal antibody against BCL2 oncoprotein, using 2-step Envision system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 39 cases, 31 cases (79.4%) were completely negative for BCL2, whereas 5 (12.8%) were weak focal positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, another 4 (10.2%) cases did show strong diffuse cytoplasmic staining for BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent in-Situ hybridization (FISH) for t(14:18) was optimally done on 6 out of 9 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these 4 cases were from adults with 3 out of 4 arising in the parotid region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two out of 4 cases also showed t(8:14) on FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that contrary to the common belief, strong BCL2 IHC expression is possible in typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in adults and cannot be absolutely relied upon to distinguish between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
