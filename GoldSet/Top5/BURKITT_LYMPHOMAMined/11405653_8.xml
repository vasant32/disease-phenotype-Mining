<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TSCs 1-8 exhibited potent cytotoxic activity against human <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> CCRF-CEM cells (IC(50) = 0.05-0.77 microM) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> HT-29 cells (IC(50) = 0.011-2.22 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Copper II complexes of TSCs 1-8 showed significant improvement in cytotoxic activity against HT-29 cells (IC(50) = 0.004-1.51 microM) by a factor of 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, complexation of ligands 1, 2, 4, and 6 with Fe(II) results in lowering of cytotoxic activity by a factor of approximately 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In clonogenic assays involving human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells of different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> origins, compounds 5, 7, 8, and their copper complexes 5Cu(II), 7Cu(II), and 8Cu(II) exhibited remarkable cytotoxic activities with mean IC(50) values of 6, 0.18, 1, 1, 0.37, and 0.37 nM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, the compounds were highly effective against human colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and large and small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TSC derivative 5 was evaluated in vivo in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice bearing LXFL 529 human large cell <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With respect to antitumor activity, application of 30 mg/kg/d resulted in moderate inhibition (42%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> was observed at a dose of 10 mg/kg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, a dose of 40 or 60 mg/kg/d resulted in 50 and 75% <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, respectively, in the treated mice, indicating the high toxicity of these compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using human liver microsomes, compound 5 was found to be rapidly and highly metabolized in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In actual fact, only 2% of the unmetabolized compound could be detected in the incubation medium after 5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The IC(50) for cell proliferation (0.006-0.022 microM) elicited by these compounds is much lower than that of the inhibition of [(14)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> incorporation into DNA (0.18-3.32 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These compounds are also noncell cycle specific agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, compounds 5, 5Cu(II), and 8 were found to be potent inducers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
