<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell density of the cultures was varied by modifying the number of cells initially seeded and growing for different periods of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under these experimental conditions the growth rate was not correlated with cell density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the activity of amino acid transport through Systems A and ASC, as assessed by the uptake of proline and serine, respectively, decreased as a function of cell density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This marked decrease of transport activity cannot be explained by large alterations of cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> since it was observed at a cell density range where minimal change of cell volume and surface area occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When a constant number of cells suspended in an identical volume of medium sedimented on different settling areas, a marked effect on amino acid transport activity occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that cell to cell contacts may be involved in the density-dependent regulation of transport </plain></SENT>
