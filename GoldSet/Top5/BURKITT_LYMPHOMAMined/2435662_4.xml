<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major antigen identified by this antibody on such B lymphocytes (BLCa) is a 55-kDa <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> or a group of similar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi>, with the MA6-reactive determinant localized on the carbohydrate moiety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On isoelectric focusing, this antigen exhibits a degree of charge microheterogeneity, migrating as a diffused band with an average isoelectric point at pH 5.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BLCa was also identified by another murine MAb, MA5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antigenic determinant recognized by this antibody is also localized on the carbohydrate moiety of the molecule, but, unlike the MA6-reactive determinant, it is shared by other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> from different types of cells </plain></SENT>
