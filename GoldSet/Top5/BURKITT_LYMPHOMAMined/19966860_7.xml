<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is noted for its transforming potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, it also acts as a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> and growth-relenting factor in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The underlying molecular mechanisms of the growth inhibitory property of LMP1 have remained largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that LMP1 negatively regulates a major oncogene, TCL1, in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MicroRNA (miR) profiling of LMP1 transfectants showed that among others, miR-29b, is upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LMP1 diminished TCL1 by inducing miR-29b through C-terminus activation region 1 (CTAR1) and CTAR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>miR-29b <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48010">locked nucleic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="48010">LNA</z:chebi>) antisense oligonucleotide transfection into LMP1-expressing cells reduced miR-29b expression and consequently reconstituted TCL1, suggesting that LMP1 negatively regulates TCL1 through miR-29b upregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The miR-29b increase by LMP1 was due to an increase in the cluster pri-miR-29b1-a transcription, derived from human chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using pharmacological inhibitors, we found that p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase-activating function of LMP1 is important for this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ability of LMP1 to negatively regulate TCL1 through miR-29b might underlie its B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> growth antagonistic property </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As LMP1 is also important for B-cell transformation, we suggest that the functional dichotomy of this <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein may depend on a combination of levels of its expression, lineage and differentiation of the target cells and regulation of miRs, which then directs the outcome of the cellular response </plain></SENT>
