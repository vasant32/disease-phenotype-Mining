<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The factor(s) stimulated the growth of both B cells 6410t, obtained from the blood of a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, and the human embryonic diploid fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With B cell lines Raji and P3HR-1.G5, obtained from the patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The growth factor(s) displayed cytotoxic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> effects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Growth-stimulating and cytotoxic activating of the factor were destroyed by a 15 hour exposure to low or high pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The activity was stable within pH values of 6-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With regard to heat stability, the activity destroyed at 70 degrees C within 1 hour but remained stable at 56 degrees C during 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The above factor(s) displayed biological activities similar to those of the previously known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) </plain></SENT>
