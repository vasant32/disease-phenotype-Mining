<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This protein is located in the cytoplasm in a soluble form and is induced by concentrations of interferon which induce the antiviral state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">Messenger RNA</z:chebi> prepared from interferon-treated human and bovine cells contains a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> which yields on translation in vitro a protein similar in size to the 15-kDa protein induced by interferon in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The human protein has been purified to homogeneity from interferon-treated human cells by ion-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> generated by V8 protease from the human and bovine 15-kDa proteins reveals that the two proteins are similar but not identical </plain></SENT>
