<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although RIT antitumor activity in vivo can always be improved with larger doses, clinical restriction on the dose toleration makes it critical to explore how RIT antitumor activity can be maximized without resorting to dose elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, a mathematical model was developed to explore functional correlations between the properties of several recombinant immunotoxins and their antitumor efficacies in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simulations were compared with experimental data of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenografts grown on <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice to assess parameters critical to optimal antitumor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We dissected out or held constant as many parameters of the model as possible to investigate the effect of the remaining parameters on the behavior of the system as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Empirical correlations between immunotoxin binding affinity and the target binding site density were obtained for several recombinant immunotoxins targeting either human A431 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> or CD46 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simulations reinforced the idea of binding site barrier for drug diffusion and suggested that optimal antitumor activity was achieved when the binding affinity is logarithmically dependent on the target binding site density </plain></SENT>
