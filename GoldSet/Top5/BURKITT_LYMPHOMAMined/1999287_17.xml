<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed a chromosomal translocation, t(2;8)(p11;q24), in a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, KOBK101 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The translocation reciprocally occurred between a site about 150 bp upstream from the J5 segment in the Ig kappa-encoding gene on chromosome 2 and the A-rich end of an Alu repetitive element located far downstream from the c-myc gene on chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Short segments of both parental chromosomes were deleted at the rearrangement site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A sequence related to the heptamer recognition signal for the V-J recombination of Ig genes and a topoisomerase I-recognition sequence were detected at the breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The V-J recombination occurred on both chromosome 2 and the translocated chromosome 2p- at the J3 and J4 segments, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The J region on the translocated chromosomes was mutated, as compared with that on the untranslocated chromosome, while the Alu element and its upstream sequence were conserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the following aspects to the chromosomal translocation of this cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A V-J recombination seems to have occurred at the proximal end of the J4 segment first, and then the translocation took place in the region between the J4 and J5 segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The translocation may have been mediated by the functions of topoisomerase I and the Alu repetitive sequence located at the breakpoint, although the possibility cannot be ruled out that the recombination machinery for Ig gene rearrangements functioned irregularly </plain></SENT>
