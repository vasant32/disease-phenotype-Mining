<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cytokines are frequently used after chemotherapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> to augment recovery of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and leukemic myelopoiesis is well investigated, little is known about effects of cytokines on growth and differentiation of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the expression of receptors for G-CSF, GM-CSF, SCF, IL-3, and IL-7 on <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) blasts and the effects of these growth factors (GF) on ALL blast colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The binding of fluorescence-tagged cytokines to receptors on ALL blasts was studied by flow-cytometry in 27 cases of ALL (24 precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, 3 T-ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receptor-binding for myeloid-associated GF was observed in the majority of precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> (G-CSF = 100%, GM-CSF = 65%, IL-3 = 83%, SCF = 74%), but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binding of labelled IL-7 was detected in both precursor B- (92%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of receptors for SCF in ALL was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction for c-kit <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in 19/21 cases tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of receptors for G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, and SCF was not associated with expression of myeloid antigens, or with specific cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effects of these GF on clonogenic cells were tested in the ALL blast colony assay and varied between samples, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cytokines were able to increase clonogenic growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The GM-CSF/IL-3 fusion molecule PIXY-321 was most effective in promoting colony growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In some cases inhibition of colony formation was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that ALL blast cells have receptors not only for IL-7, but also for G-CSF, GM-CSF, SCF, and IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ALL precursors can respond to these GF with changes in their clonogenic growth indicating the presence of functional receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Results may have implications for therapeutic approaches combining cytokines and chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
