<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> as a primary manifestation of the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients had simultaneous regional lymph node involvement documented by the findings of subsequent biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority (five patients) had solitary nodules involving the skin of the head and neck region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the skin biopsy specimens were classified as lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, two large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, two mixed small and large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and one small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disseminated disease subsequently developed in four patients in an interval that ranged from 4 to 30 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 8 to 56 months, and median survival was 56 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A literature review of 33 previously reported patients and our eight patients indicate that: skin of the head and the neck region is the most common site of involvement (56%); the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are diffuse (93%); lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is the predominant type (53%), with a high proportion showing a non-T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>; Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> of the skin are extremely rare; and most patients presented in an early clinical stage (Stage IE 56%, Stage IIE 21%), and prolonged disease-free survival was seen mostly in Stage I patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probability of survival for Stage I patients at 24 months was 0.71; while for Stages II to IV patients combined, it was 0.33 at 26 months </plain></SENT>
