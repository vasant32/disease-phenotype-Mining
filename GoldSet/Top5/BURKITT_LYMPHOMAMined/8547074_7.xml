<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By PCR analysis of 30 cell lines, including 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) and 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, we found homozygous deletions of at least one locus in 11 (37%) cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MTS1-specific sequences were deleted in 70% of ALL (reaching 86% in T-cell ALL) but in none of the non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MTS2-specific sequences were deleted in 40% of ALL and 17% of NHL cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed a higher frequency of MTS1 deletions in ALL than in NHL (P &lt; 0.001) and in T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> compared to B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (67% v 6%; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In ALL-derived cell lines deletions of the MTS2 gene only occurred in cases with MTS1 deletions but in NHL only in cases without MTS1 deletions </plain></SENT>
