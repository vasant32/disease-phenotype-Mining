<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The RIT HA22 contains the Fv portion of an anti-CD22 antibody fused to a 38 kDa fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As PE38 is a <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> protein, patients frequently produce antibodies that neutralize its activity, preventing retreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have earlier shown in mice that PE38 contains 7 major B-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> located in domains II and III of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we present a new mutant RIT, HA22-LR-6X, in which we removed most B-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> by deleting domain II and mutating 6 residues in domain III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HA22-LR-6X is cytotoxic to several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, has very low nonspecific toxicity, and retains potent antitumor activity in mice with CA46 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To assess its immunogenicity, we immunized 3 MHC-divergent strains of mice with 5 microg doses of HA22-LR-6X, and found that HA22-LR-6X elicited significantly lower antibody responses than HA22 or other mutant RITs with fewer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, large (50 microg) doses of HA22-LR-6X induced markedly lower antibody responses than 5 microg of HA22, indicating that high doses can be administered with low immunogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our experiments show that we have correctly identified and removed B-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> from PE38, producing a highly active immunotoxin with low immunogenicity and low animal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future studies will determine if these properties carry over to humans with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
