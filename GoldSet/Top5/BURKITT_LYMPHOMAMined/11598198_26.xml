<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that TGFbeta-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is caspase-dependent and associated with activation of caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show here that caspase-8 inhibitors strongly decrease TGFbeta-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in BL41 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These inhibitors act upstream of the mitochondria because they inhibited the loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential observed in TGFbeta-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TGFbeta induced caspase-8 activation in these cells as shown by the cleavage of specific substrates, including Bid, and the appearance of cleaved fragments of caspase-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data show that TGFbeta induces an apoptotic pathway involving sequential caspase-8 activation, loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential, and caspase-9 and -3 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Caspase-8 activation was Fas-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> domain protein (FADD)-independent because cells expressing a dominant negative mutant of FADD were still sensitive to TGFbeta-induced caspase-8 activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This FADD-independent pathway of caspase-8 activation is regulated by p38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, TGFbeta-induced activation of p38 and two different inhibitors specific for this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase pathway (SB203580 and PD169316) prevented TGFbeta-mediated caspase-8 activation as well as the loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, our data show that p38 activation by TGFbeta induced an apoptotic pathway via FADD-independent activation of caspase-8 </plain></SENT>
