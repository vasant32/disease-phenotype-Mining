<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> revealed a considerably delayed response in comparison to that observed with heat treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 4 h after heat (43.5 degrees C) exposure, 50% of the cells were undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> whereas that level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was only reached after 16 h of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> (5 mM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by both treatments was accompanied by a marked increase in hsp70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximum response in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> preceded a rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in both cases, and the response was transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a corresponding increase in the level of hsp70 protein after exposure to both heat and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> which coincided with the pattern of increase in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> but protein levels remained high during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
