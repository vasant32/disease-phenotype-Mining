<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, deletion of p16/p15 locus has been shown to be highly specific to lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, and more particularly to T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in the other subsets of ALL, deletions of p16 and p15 are relatively rare events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether these genes are inactivated by methylation of the 5' CpG islands, we examined 35 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines and 29 childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients by Southern blot, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found methylation of p16 in 12 (50%) of 24 ALL cell lines, 5 (50%) of 10 AML cell lines without homozygous deletion of p16, and 11 (38%) of 29 AML patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines subjected to p16 methylation were found to have lost p16 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The p15 gene was methylated in 10 (34%) of 29 ALL cell lines, 6 (60%) of 10 AML cell lines without homozygous deletion of p15, and 15 (52%) of 29 AML patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results revealed the frequent methylation of p16 and p15 genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> despite a low frequency of p16 and p15 deletions and mutations in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the study for expression of RB protein, we found no expression of RB in 4 of 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inactivation of the p16 gene was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cell lines with expression of RB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither amplification nor rearrangement of cyclin D1 gene was found in any cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that inactivation of p16 and p15 genes is one of the most common genetic events in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, and plays an important role for the RB/p16 pathway in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
