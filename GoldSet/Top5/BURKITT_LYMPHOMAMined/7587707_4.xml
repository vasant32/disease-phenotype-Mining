<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an effort to improve detection of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-mediated multidrug resistance (mdr), several dyes were compared to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">rhodamine 123</z:chebi> (R123) in efflux assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two dyes (SY-38 and SY-3150) were found that provided better sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These dyes were effluxed by a cell line known to be mdr-positive (P388/R84) but not by an mdr-negative cell line (P388) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efflux was blocked by both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efflux from KG1a cells was less than from P388/R84, just as has been seen with R123 and daunomycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In further experiments, a model system was used to demonstrate two-color immunofluorescence plus efflux measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was done using a sequential staining method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A procedure was devised that, at least for this model system, allowed single-step staining with both dye and antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the efflux measurement was slightly compromised by using this one-step staining method </plain></SENT>
