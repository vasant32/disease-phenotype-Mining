<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To investigate the clinical and pathologic features as well as the MYC translocations of childhood Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) from China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourty-three cases of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were retrospectively investigated in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, immunophenotype, genotype, treatments and survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinically, there was a marked male predominance in sex distribution (M: F=9.75:1); abdomen was the most frequent extranodal sites of involvement (46.5%), followed by jaws and facial bones (16.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two third of the patients were in stageI ~ II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, 69.76% of the cases showed classical histologic features, while 30.24% of them showed greater nuclear pleomorphism in size and shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five cases (11.6%) were positive for EBER1/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one of the 40 cases (77.5%) had the aberration of IGH/MYC translocation while 7 (17.5%) had non-IGH/MYC translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (69.7%) received operation and/or chemotherapy while 13 patients (30.3%) received no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients (62.8%) died of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, 16 alive, with the average survival time 4.9 and 48.7 months respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High IPI, advanced clinical stage, increased serum level of LDH and no chemotherapy received as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size≥10 cm were related to the lower survival rates of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Several differences were showed in this group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, including a much higher ratio of male patients, more cases in stageII, clinically inconsistent treatment and a very poor outcome </plain></SENT>
