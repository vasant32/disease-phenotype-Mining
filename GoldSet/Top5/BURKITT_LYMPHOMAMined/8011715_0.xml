<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These characteristics were herewith investigated in the authors medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of the patients in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed were reviewed studying the usual clinical, epidemiological, histological and biological variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients: 10 with non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and four with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence was 5% of the total number of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients of the former and none of the latter had previously uncomplicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The following histologic types were observed: two Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 4 undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 4 immunoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> among the non Hodgkin cases and two with mixed cellularity, one lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and one undetermined among the Hodgkin's cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent of the patients with non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 50% of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> presented a IV-B stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median of survival was 2.5 months (limits 1-8) for non Hodgkin cases and 11 months (limits 1-36) for the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> in the authors' medium is similar to that referred in other studies although a high proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> may be found </plain></SENT>
