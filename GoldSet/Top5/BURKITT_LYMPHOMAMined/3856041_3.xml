<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two cell lines differed in sensitivity when exposed to heat: The MM cells were unaffected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> (42 degrees C), whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells were sensitive to this temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the MM cells, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> potentiated the cytotoxic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (ADM), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> (DHAD), and quelamycin but did not enhance that of aclacinomycin (ACM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the exposure of cells to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> compounds at 0 degree C resulted in almost complete disappearance of cell kill effects except with ACM; ACM retained substantial cell kill effects even at the given low temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, ADM- or DHAD-induced cell <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> was also potentiated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>; ACM produced only additive cell kill </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 0 degree C, ACM's effects virtually disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines have a substantial variety in heat sensitivity and that not every <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> antitumor agent is potentiated by temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ACM's thermoresponse is unique among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49322">anthracycline antibiotics</z:chebi> studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it was shown that normothermic cell kill by ADM was not affected by hyperthermic preheating; however, preheating of appropriate duration produced important influence on subsequent hyperthermic ADM-induced cell kill </plain></SENT>
