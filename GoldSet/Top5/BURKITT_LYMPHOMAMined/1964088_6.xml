<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consistent with findings obtained with transient expression assays, we observed marked accumulation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B in the nucleus of Namalwa B lymphoid cells, which constitutively express Tax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, NF-kappa B activity was not detected in the nucleus following long-term expression of Tax in Jurkat T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability of both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> and cytokines to activate NF-kappa B was also blocked in Jurkat cells constitutively expressing Tax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the activation of other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-inducible transcription factors, such as Fos and Jun, was unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, depending on the cellular environment, the short- and long-term effects of Tax expression can be quite different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, one function of Tax in cells infected with HTLV-I might involve cell-type-specific suppression, as opposed to activation, of distinct signal pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cells lines described here should be useful for the delineation of signaling pathways utilized in the selective regulation of gene expression </plain></SENT>
