<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of alpha(1)-acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (AGP), which mainly contains alpha2,6-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi>, on anti-IgM antibody (Ab)-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Ramos cells, which are derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When Ramos cells were incubated with anti-IgM-Ab in plates coated with AGP, neuraminidase-digested AGP (asAGP) or alpha2,3-sialylated AGP (2,3AGP), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was suppressed only in those coated with AGP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also studied the effects of CD22, which is expressed on the surface of mature B cells and binds to sugar chains containing alpha2,6-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi>, with anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody (mAb) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These contradictory results suggested that the recognition molecules for alpha2,6-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> on AGP, which inhibits B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, is distinct from CD22, or that different binding domains of CD22 between alpha2,6-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> and anti-CD22 mAb exert opposite functions of suppression or enhancement to anti-IgM Ab-induced B cells </plain></SENT>
