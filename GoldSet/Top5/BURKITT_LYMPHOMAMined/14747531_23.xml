<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We have found that in three different clones of EBV-infected lymphoblasts the levels of expression of LMP1 in individual cells in each clone ranged over 100-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This difference is due to a difference in levels of the LMP1 transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In these clones, cells expressing high levels of LMP1 incorporated less BrdU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We also found that induction of expression of LMP1 or of a derivative of LMP1 with its transmembrane domain fused to green fluorescent protein instead of its carboxy-terminal signaling domain resulted in phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha in EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This induction of phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha was also detected in EBV-infected lymphoblasts, in which high levels of LMP1 correlated with high levels of phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that inhibition of gene expression and of cell proliferation by LMP1 occurs normally in EBV-infected cells </plain></SENT>
