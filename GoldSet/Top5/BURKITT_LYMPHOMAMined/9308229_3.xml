<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over the past several years, our laboratory has been instrumental in the elucidation of the structure of the mouse Pvt 1 locus as a means of understanding the relationship between these two divergent Txs which, nevertheless, produce indistinguishable disease phenotypes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have recently constructed transgenic mice harboring a translocated Pvt 1/Ck segment in order to determine whether 1). these mice produce the Pvt 1/Ck fusion product 2). these mice are immunocompromised and 3). these mice develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of a B cell origin </plain></SENT>
