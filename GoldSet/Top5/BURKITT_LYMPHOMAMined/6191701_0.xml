<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They showed a marked less sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> than the cells at the exponential phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cell kinetic analysis revealed that the stationary phase was occupied by G1 cells, which were different from exponential G1 cells at various points of metabolic and nutritive state except for DNA content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, by synchronizing the exponential cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi>, the response of G1 cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, their sensitivity to the drug was found to almost coincide with that of the stationary cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the less sensitivity of the stationary cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> was due to the total occupation of the stationary phase by G1 cells showing originally resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
