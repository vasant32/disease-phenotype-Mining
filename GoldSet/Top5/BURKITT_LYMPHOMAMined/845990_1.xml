<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Intravenous injection of cells and their tissue culture supernatants (CS) from human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) induced the formation of lesions on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chicken embryo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Injection of cells and CS from non-LCL and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human lymphocytes induced few or no lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Irradiated chick embryos were more sensitive to lesion formation than were nonirradiated embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The log10 CAM lesions induced in irradiated (500 rads) embryos were a linear function of the log10 cells (from LCL) in the inoculum; the slope was 1.0, within experimental error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The formation of CAM lesions did not depend on the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) since lesions were also induced by cells and extracts derived from EBV genome-free LCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesion-inducing activity associated with CS was filterable through 0.22-mu filters, sedimented at 78,000 x g, and sensitive to inactivation by heat (56 degrees C for 30 min), UV irradiation, <z:chebi fb="59" ids="35255">chloroform</z:chebi>, sera from chickens immunized against CS, and certain human sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesion-inducing activity associated with cells and extracts was resistant to 5,000 rads of gamma-radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B2/B2 embryos (the B locus is the major histocompatibility locus of chickens) were more sensitive to lesion formation than were B15/B21 and outbred embryos; this suggested a genetic influence on lesion formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the irradiated chicken embryo may be a highly sensitive and useful means for the detection of an unidentified or unknown agent or agents that may play an important role in human oncogenic lymphocyte transformation or might interact with transforming viruses </plain></SENT>
