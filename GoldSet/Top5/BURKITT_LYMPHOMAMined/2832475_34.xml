<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> producing system of EBV-BLCL (B cell oxidase) was compared with the phagocytic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>-oxidase and the relationship of the capacity to produce <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> to the presence of the EBV-genome was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two EBV-transformed B cell lines F1 and HELL generated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> in response to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> (2.3 nmol/10(6) F1 cells x 1 h and 6.27 nmol/10(6) HELL cells x 1 h with 1 microgram/ml of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>), whereas no <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> release was detected with the EBV-positive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line WIL-2 and the EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">plasmocytoma</z:e> line U-266 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, F1 and HELL showed lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence (CL) after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-treatment, whereas no CL responses were detected from WIL-2 or U-266 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, F1 and HELL cells contained a low potential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38551">cytochrome b</z:chebi>-245 (10.9 and 61.0 pmol/mg protein, respectively) and also a 45 kDa <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33079">diphenylene</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50317">iodonium</z:chebi> (DPI)-binding <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, both components of the phagocytic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>-oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, neither the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38551">cytochrome b</z:chebi>-245 nor the 45 kDa DPI-binding <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were detected in WIL-2 and U-266 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, DPI inhibited <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> production by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-stimulated EBV-BLCL and polymorphonuclear granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, F1 line cells showed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase-inhibitable lucigenin-dependent CL when triggered by protein A-bearing staphylococci (Cowan strain I) or by a mAb directed against human IgG in the presence of solid-phase goat anti-mouse-Ig antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From a panel of eight EBV-BLCL, only five responded with CL when exposed to protein A-bearing staphylococci, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed CL when treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inasmuch as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight EBV-BLCL possessed surface Ig and a "functional" oxidase, their differential response to cross-linking of surface Ig may be determined by differences in signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> production by EBV-BLCL appears thus related to expression of an electron transport chain structurally homologous, if not identical, with the "phagocytic" <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>-oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Apparently, the presence of EBV-genome in B cell lines does not per se lead to expression of this oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests that nontransformed B cells may, at a certain differentiation stage, also express a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>-generating chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>From the finding of stimulation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production of EBV-BLCL via surface Ig it appears possible that also Ag may be able to trigger such B cells to production of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> which might have an important role in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of B cells </plain></SENT>
