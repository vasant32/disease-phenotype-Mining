<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ligands is being explored for immunotherapy of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It will be critical to identify which of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ligands identified are the most active functionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the Cytosensor microphysiometer, SUP-B8 cells and B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells obtained from patients were found to acidify their extracellular environment within minutes of specific activation by surrogate <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ligands or by anti-idiotype antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This signal was blocked by pretreatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of SUP-B8 cells with dimeric and tetrameric specific <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ligands caused a rapid increase in extracellular acidification rate, which peaked after 10 min at approximately 15 and 20% above basal rates, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These responses were blocked by excess monomeric <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the ability of different <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ligands to induce a signal directly on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, thereby establishing their relative affinity to the surface immunoglobulin receptor, acidification rate changes were measured at varying <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The microphysiometer signal correlated with the known relative affinities and antiproliferative potencies of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This approach is particularly useful for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> cells that cannot be cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The signal may be predictive of the efficacy of treatment with synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ligands and may be useful in the evaluation of ligands for other cell surface receptors with biological effects on B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
