<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Functions of exosomes released by "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" cells are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In fact, several studies have been carried out on exosomes derived from hematopoietic cells, but very little is known about NK cell exosomes, despite the importance of these cells in innate and adaptive immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we report that resting and activated NK cells, freshly isolated from blood of healthy donors, release exosomes expressing typical protein markers of NK cells and containing killer proteins (i.e., Fas ligand and perforin molecules) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These nanovesicles display cytotoxic activity against several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines and activated, but not resting, immune cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also show that NK-derived exosomes undergo uptake by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> target cells but not by resting PBMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exosomes purified from plasma of healthy donors express NK cell markers, including CD56+ and perforin, and exert cytotoxic activity against different human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> target cells and activated immune cells as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this study propose an important role of NK cell-derived exosomes in immune surveillance and homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this study supports the use of exosomes as an almost perfect example of biomimetic nanovesicles possibly useful in future therapeutic approaches against various diseases, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
