<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that this reflects human recognition of the foreign mouse protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have found that the amount of antibody administered also influenced pharmacokinetic behavior when murine monoclonal antibody was administered to mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p-Isothiocyanatobenzyl-EDTA, a new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> which forms complexes with 111In that are stable in vivo, was conjugated to Lym-1, a murine anti-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetics of two doses (20 and 0.2 micrograms) of the 111In labeled radiopharmaceutical were studied in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> bearing BALB/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>About 20% (0.04 microgram) of the 0.2-microgram dose, compared with 8% (1.6 micrograms) of the 20-micrograms dose, was found in the liver at 48 h after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both doses demonstrated a biological half-life of approximately 120 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At least 75% of the 111In was excreted by the kidneys, and essentially <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 111In in the urine remained chelated by the EDTA portion of p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-EDTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From these observations of a dose dependent uptake of this radiopharmaceutical by the liver we conclude that there is a recognition phenomenon in mice for this murine monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
