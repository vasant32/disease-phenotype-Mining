<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A rabbit antiserum raised against the strongly stimulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line DAUDI, after appropriate absorption with EB1, inhibits MLC stimulation by both B cell lines and allogeneic lymphocytes, whilst lectin-induced proliferation is not significantly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indirect immunofluorescence and 125I-staphylococcal protein A binding to cells pre-incubated with this antiserum suggest that the antigen is present on both peripheral B and T cells, as well as on B lymphoblastoid and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this antiserum is directed against lymphocyte activating determinant(s) (LADs) and that these are distinct from the serologically defined DR antigens </plain></SENT>
