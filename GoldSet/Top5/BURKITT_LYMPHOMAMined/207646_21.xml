<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both jijoye lines were superinfectable, inducible, and carried EBV and C3 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Virus-producing P3HR-1 cells and recently derived non-producer sublines lacked EBV-receptors and C3 receptors, could not be superinfected, but were IdUrd inducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two long-passaged, non-producer sublines of P3HR-1 reexpressed EBV and C3 receptors to an equal degree (different in the two sublines) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBV-superinfectability became partially reestablished in the subline with the higher expression of EBV and C3 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that the EBV-receptor/C3 receptor negativity of the producer P3HR-1 sublines and their recent non-producer derivatives is due to negative selection by the growth-inhibitory, cytopathic P3HR-1 virus variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The closely linked disappearance and reappearance of EBV-receptors and complement receptors gives further support to the idea that these two receptors are either identical or closely linked constituents of the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
