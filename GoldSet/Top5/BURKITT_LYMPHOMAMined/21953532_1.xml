<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lectin recognized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4139">D-galactose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18024,47962">D-galacturonic acid</z:chebi> and had a 32 kDa dimer consisting of two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-bonded 16 kDa subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen N-terminus amino acids were identified by Edman degradation, having unique primary structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lectin blotting analysis with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated lectins has shown that AKL-2 was a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> with complex type <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17411">N-acetyl D-glucosamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> at non-reducing terminal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two protein bands with 38 and 36 kDa in the crude extract of sea hare eggs after purification of the lectin was isolated by AKL-2-conjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> column and elution with 0.1 M <z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">lactose</z:chebi> containing buffer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It suggested that the lectin binds with an endogenous ligand in the eggs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AKL-2 kept extreme stability on haemagglutination activity if it was treated at pH 3 and 70 °C for 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glycan binding profile of AKL-2 by frontal affinity chromatography technology using 15 pyridylamine labeled <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> has been appeared that the lectin uniquely recognized globotriose (<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>α1-4Galβ1-4Glc; Gb3) in addition to bi-antennary complex type N-linked <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16153">N-acetyllactosamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surface plasmon resonance analysis of AKL-2 against a neo-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, Gb3-human serum albumin showed the k(ass) and k(diss) values are 2.4 × 10³ M⁻¹ s⁻¹ and 3.8 × 10⁻³ s⁻¹, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AKL-2 appeared cytotoxicity against both Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji cell and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> K562 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The activity to Raji by the lectin was preferably cancelled by the co-presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28053">melibiose</z:chebi> mimicing Gb3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, K562 was cancelled effectively by <z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">lactose</z:chebi> than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28053">melibiose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It elucidated that AKL-2 had cytotoxic ability mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> structure to cultured cells </plain></SENT>
