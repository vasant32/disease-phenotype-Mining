<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cultured Burkitt cells were examined by immunofluorescence, autoradiography, and electron microscopy in an effort to identify the stainable cells with those harboring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e>-type virus particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immediately after a 2-hr pulse of (3)H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi>, from 30 to 60% of the cells revealed heavy nuclear labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most cases the grains were evenly dispersed, but in about 3 to 5% the grains showed a focal distribution and occasionally they extended into the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such nuclear foci were rarely seen at 8 hr after the pulse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the analysis was restricted to preselected immunofluorescent cells, up to 80% showed label at 8 hr and cytoplasmic grains were prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To reduce cellular <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (DNA) synthesis, cells were X-irradiated with 3,000 to 6,000 R, and the isotope pulse was applied 1, 4, or 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas the total number of labeled cells decreased in roughly twofold steps at the respective intervals (from 40 to 10%), the incorporation of (3)H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> into fluorescent cells was not affected by X irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In each series, about 70% of the fluorescent cells contained label when they were examined at 24 and 48 hr after the pulse, whereas at 8 and 72 hr fewer were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the earlier intervals, unlabeled fluorescent cells most likely represented cells which had completed <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA synthesis prior to the pulse; at the later intervals, unlabeled fluorescent cells were probably cells which commenced <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication after the pulse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data support the conclusion that the immunofluorescent cells are the ones which harbor virus, and also confirm the expectation that the virus is a DNA virus from a member of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This conclusion was firmly established by sectioning and electron microscopic examination of individual fluorescent cells, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which contained numerous virus particles, whereas the nonstained cells prepared in a similar manner were free of them </plain></SENT>
