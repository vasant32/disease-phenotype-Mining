<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that two distinct ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathways for beta-catenin are active in the same Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells: Along with the classical <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>-synthase kinase 3beta-dependent destruction machinery, degradation of beta-catenin through seven in absentia homolog 1 (Siah-1) ubiquitin ligase is functional in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that inhibition of endogenous Siah-1 stabilizes and activates beta-catenin in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The principal Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein, latent membrane protein 1, is involved in beta-catenin up-regulation, and expression of latent membrane protein 1 in B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells is associated with decreased Siah-1 RNA and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we demonstrate the significance of the endogenous Siah-1-dependent ubiquitin/proteasome pathway for beta-catenin degradation in malignant human cells and its regulation by a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> oncogene </plain></SENT>
