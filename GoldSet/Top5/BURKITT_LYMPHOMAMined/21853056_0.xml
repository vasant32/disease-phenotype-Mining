<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In B-lymphocytes, EBV expresses a restricted subset of genes, the Latency III program, which converts B-lymphocytes to proliferating lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1) and the other Latency III associated proteins are also expressed during virus replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LMP1 is essential for virus replication and egress from Akata Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, but a role in epithelial cell replication has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have investigated whether LMP1 enhances EBV replication and egress from HEK293 cells, a model epithelial cell line used for EBV recombinant molecular genetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (wt) and LMP1-deleted (LMP1Δ) EBV <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome (BAC) based virus replication and egress from HEK293 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following EBV immediate early Zta protein induction of EBV replication in HEK293 cells, similar levels of EBV proteins were expressed in wt- and LMP1Δ-infected HEK293 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LMP1 deletion did not impair EBV replication associated DNA replication, DNA encapsidation, or mature virus release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, virus from LMP1Δ-infected HEK293 cells was as infectious as EBV from wt EBV infected HEK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Trans-complementation with LMP1 reduced Rta expression and subsequent virus production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that LMP1 is not required for EBV replication and egress from HEK293 cells </plain></SENT>
