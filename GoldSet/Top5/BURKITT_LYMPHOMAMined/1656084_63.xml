<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BHRF1 is also transiently expressed in some latently infected cell lines in the absence of expression of other lytic cycle proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BHRF1 shares distant, but significant, colinear primary amino acid sequence homology to Bc12, a cellular gene strongly implicated in the evolution of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experiments reported here used a molecular genetic approach to examine the role of BHRF1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Isogenic EBV recombinants having either <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> BHRF1 or a null mutation due to a translational stop signal in place of the 24th BHRF1 codon were used to infect primary B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BHRF1 mutant recombinants did not differ from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> in their ability to infect and transform the growth of primary B lymphocytes, to replicate in the resultant lymphoblastoid cell lines, or to initiate a second round of primary cell transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the entire BHRF1 open reading frame did not destroy the ability of the mutant virus to maintain cell growth transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significance of these findings with regard to the role of BHRF1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> is discussed </plain></SENT>
