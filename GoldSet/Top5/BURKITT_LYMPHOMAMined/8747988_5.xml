<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It was the aim of this study to examine the prognostic value of the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>), with the help of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) who underwent sequential high-dose therapy with peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) support, and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) of the subclass M4Eo who underwent high-dose consolidation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Basis for the application of a PCR assay in these disease entities are the following specific gene rearrangements: the t(14;18) translocation in a high percentage of NHL, the clonal rearrangement of the Ig heavy chain locus resulting in a unique complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) for MM region and the inversion 16 characteristic for the M4Eo subclass of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before the G-CSF-supported cytotoxic chemotherapy was given, 65% of the 52 patients with low- and intermediate-grade NHL enrolled into the study had PCR+ bone marrow (BM) and/or peripheral blood (PB) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (29 of 52) were autografted with a PCR+ transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of harvests containing t(14;18)+ cells was two-fold less in patients mobilized in first remission than in those with a history of previous treatment failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was also reflected when examining the B cell contents of the harvests measured as CD19+ cells with a 3.3-fold smaller proportion of CD19+ cells in leukapheresis (LP) products of patients mobilized in first remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who received a PCR- transplant are in remission and remained PCR- in BM and PB samples post-transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversion to PCR-negativity in BM and PB samples post-transplantation was observed in 11 of 19 patients who were also in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 6 of 29 patients who were autografted with PCR+ products relapsed, while 4 of them presented with PCR- samples on several occasions post-transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with MM, the assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> in PBPC harvests was based on the CDR3 regions of the Ig heavy chain locus as a marker for clonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The great majority of LP products (17 out of 19) contained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To prove positive enrichment procedures for the elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, CD34+ and CD19+ cell fractions obtained from LP samples in an experimental setting via preparative flow cytometry were analyzed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> resulting in PCR-negativity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CD34+ fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results of the four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M4Eo and inversion 16 are preliminary, with a tendency of persistence of PCR-positivity after finishing the high-dose consolidation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In one case, recurrence of disease was accompanied by an increase of the signal strength in the PCR assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Longer follow-up periods are necessary to determine the prognostic value of these PCR findings in the different disease entities </plain></SENT>
