<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transcription of the human proto-oncogene c-myc is governed by two tandem principal promoters, termed P1 and P2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In general, the downstream promoter, P2, is predominant, which is in contrast to the promoter occlusion phenomenon usually observed in genes containing tandem promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A shift in human c-myc promoter usage has been observed in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and in certain physiological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms that regulate promoter usage are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present studies identify regulators which are required to promote transcription from both human c-myc promoters, P1 and P2, and have a role in determining their relative activities in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A novel regulatory region located 101 bp upstream of P1 was characterized and contains five tandem repeats of the consensus sequence CCCTCCCC (CT element) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The integrity of the region containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five elements is required to promote transcription from P1 and for maximal activity from P2 in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A single copy of this same element, designated CT-I2, also appears in an inverted orientation 53 bp upstream of the P2 transcription start site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This element has an inhibitory effect on P1 transcription and is required for P2 transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The transcription factor Sp1 was identified as the factor that binds specifically to the tandem CT elements upstream of P1 and to the CT-I2 element upstream of P2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the recently cloned zinc finger protein ZF87, or MAZ, was also able to bind these same elements in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The five tandem CT elements can be functionally replaced by a heterologous enhancer that only in the absence of CT-I2 reverses the promoter usage, similar to what is observed in the translocated c-myc allele of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
