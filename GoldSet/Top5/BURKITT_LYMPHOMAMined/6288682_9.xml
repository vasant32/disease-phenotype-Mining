<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the purification of a protein that is responsible for the effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> precipitation, chromatography on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> and cellulose, molecular sieve chromatography on Bio-Gel A-5, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> gradient centrifugation, the factor was enriched about 300,000-fold compared to calf serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under neutral conditions, the protein chromatographed as a high molecular weight protein of about 5.5 X 10(5) both in its active and inactive form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both forms of the molecule sedimented at about 7 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The factor is an acidic protein with a pI of 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It seems to be composed of high molecular and low molecular weight subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nanogram amounts of purified factor are sufficient for measurable inducing effects </plain></SENT>
