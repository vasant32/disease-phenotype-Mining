<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three monoclonal antibodies against human liver ferritin were selected to study antigenic determinants (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi>) of human isoferritins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These monoclonal antibodies were found to form immunoprecipitin lines with ferritin in double diffusion tests (Ouchterlony), indicating multiple <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on a single ferritin molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibodies revealed high species specificity as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies MA301 and MA311 appeared to recognize different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi>, since they did not inhibit each other in competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, MA309 recognized both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> for MA301 and MA311 with similar competitive inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> were not detectable when ferritin was treated with 8M <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> (pH 2.5) and were detectable upon reconstruction by dialysis against 2 M <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> (pH 7.2), suggesting that these monoclonals recognize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> in the tertiary structure of the ferritin molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a matter of fact, these monoclonals react preferentially with intact ferritin molecule and only negligibly with subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isoelectric focusing patterns of human ferritins demonstrated that liver, spleen, placenta, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e> cells (Li-7) transplanted in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice contained basic isoferritins, whereas HeLa cells (<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>), Wa cells (EB virus-transformed B cells), and Raji cells (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) contained acidic isoferritins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Human heart ferritin displayed a somewhat intermediate pattern between liver and HeLa ferritins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In spite of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> population of human isoferritins, the dissociation constants (Kd) of the three monoclonal antibodies to liver, HeLa, and heart isoferritins were quite similar </plain></SENT>
