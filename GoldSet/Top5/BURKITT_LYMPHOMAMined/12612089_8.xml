<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, multiple frameshifts are identified in repetitive sequences within an Epstein-Barr virus unspliced early gene, LF3, which is associated with the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replicative cycle and also transcriptionally expressed in many virally associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the DNA strand encoding LF3, there are three open reading frames, only one of which contains an initiation codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most (&gt;95%) of the gene consists of numerous (&gt;20, varying with cell source) GC-rich copies of a 102-bp direct repeat (called IR 4) flanked by small unique sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LF3 may express a protein if its initiation and termination codons reside in the same reading frame, but this is not always the case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frameshifting events, occurring in short runs of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39447">pyrimidines</z:chebi> (mainly C residues) in the repeats, give rise to mutations which may provide a mechanism for escape of an LF3 function from host surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequence studies link these frameshifts to DNA replication errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, the number of sites in LF3 at which such mutations can occur permits a very large amount of diversity in this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data also suggest a second degeneracy mechanism within the protein itself, which influences its stability and may reflect a host defense mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LF3 thus provides a potentially important model for studying the quest for supremacy between a virus and its host </plain></SENT>
