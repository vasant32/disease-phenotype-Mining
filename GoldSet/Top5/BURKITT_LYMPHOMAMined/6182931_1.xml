<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experiments with Friend-cell clones sensitive and resistant to interferon indicated that a number of changes in membrane transport occur rapidly after the addition of interferon to sensitive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While no change was observed in the activity of the (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>/K+) ATPase in Friend cells sensitive or resistant to interferon, a piretanide-inhibitable <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>,K+, 2Cl- co-transport system was specifically inhibited after interferon treatment of sensitive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, treatment of Daudi cells with purified molecularly cloned or standard preparations of human leukocyte interferon gave rise to no early changes in the transport of amino acids, 32Pi, <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi>, or 86Rb+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major change observed in Daudi cells was a marked reduction in the uptake and incorporation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi>, which begins to decrease after 8-10 h of exposure to interferon </plain></SENT>
