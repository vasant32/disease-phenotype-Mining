<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> in this EA induction system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell growth was not affected by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>-deficiency, but EA induction by most combinations of the inducers <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>), IdU (iododeoxyuridine), n-BA (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30772">n-butyric acid</z:chebi>), anti-IgM and EA inducing factor (EIF), was greatly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only the inducer combination <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>/n-BA was completely independent of the presence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, indicating a different induction pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Removing the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> moieties of the culturing serum did not result in reduced EA induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the lowered EA inducibility in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>-deficiency is due to the absence of the protein moiety (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> partially reconstituted the original EA inducibility, whereas <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">Lipoproteins</z:chebi> were particularly important during the first 4 hours of induction, the phase where inducers may act on cell membrane structures (e.g., receptors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> were also required throughout the incubation period, even in a late and inducer independent phase </plain></SENT>
