<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mild reduction of antibody (Ab) with dithiothreitol (DTT) resulted in introduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29917">thiol groups</z:chebi> into Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymer precursors used for the synthesis of the conjugates were based on N-(2-hydroxypropyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51759">methacrylamide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53440">HPMA</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymers</z:chebi> with a functional group at the polymer chain end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymers</z:chebi> were linked to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29917">thiol groups</z:chebi> of the reduced Ab via one-point attachment forming a star-shaped structure with central antibody surrounded by hydrophilic polymer chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither reduction nor polymer modification of Ab influenced binding activity of the Ab to its specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell membrane antigen as it was confirmed in vitro by standard flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anticancer drug DOX was attached to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53440">HPMA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi> chain in an Ab-polymer system via a pH-labile <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38532">hydrazone</z:chebi> linkage or via an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25676">oligopeptide</z:chebi> sequence degradable by lysosomal enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such Ab-polymer-DOX conjugates were fairly stable in aqueous solution at pH 7.4 and the drug was readily released in mildly acid environment at pH 5-5.5 by hydrolysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38532">hydrazone</z:chebi> bond or more slowly by enzymolysis with lysosomal enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> activity of the anti-CD20 monoclonal Ab-targeted conjugates tested on several CD20-positive or negative human and mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines confirmed considerable targeting capacity of the monoclonal Ab after its binding to the polymer carrier </plain></SENT>
