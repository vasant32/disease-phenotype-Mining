<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> synthesis-inducing activity for human and murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukaemia</z:e> cell lines had been detected in WEHI-3 conditioned medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EDR functions were analysed in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is released from cells immediately in response to various stressful conditions and enhances cell survival particularly at a lower concentration range and low cell density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At high cell density and high EDR concentration the opposite effect of an increase in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Its essential function within a tissue is considered to be the maintenance of growth homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cells kept in culture for weeks show a decreasing responsiveness to EDR supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was also noted in freshly cloned EDR-responsive mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukaemia</z:e> cells pointing to a molecular adaptation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Human haematopoietic progenitors were amplified 7-fold by EDR when kept at low cytokine levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At saturating levels progenitors giving rise to at least two lineages in semisolid medium (E-mix) respond to EDR with an average 1.87-fold increase in colony numbers and a bell-shaped dose-response curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the more mature BFU-E compartment a response was observed particularly in cases with low colony numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Given the release from irradiated stromal cells and the ability to partly substitute for stromal cells in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-70, EDR functions as a stromal survival factor for stroma-responsive cells </plain></SENT>
