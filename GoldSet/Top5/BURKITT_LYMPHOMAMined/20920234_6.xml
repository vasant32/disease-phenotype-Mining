<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assay its extent in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, methylation of 24 TSG was analyzed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines as well as in patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened for TSG methylation using methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) in 40 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines representing anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) as well as in 50 primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The methylation status of differentially methylated CD44 was verified by methylation-specific PCR and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene expression of CD44 and its reactivation by DNA demethylation was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and on the protein level by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by anti-CD44 antibody was analyzed by annexin-V/PI staining and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On average 8 ± 2.8 of 24 TSG were methylated per <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line and 2.4 ± 2 of 24 TSG in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, whereas 0/24 TSG were methylated in tonsils and blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, we identified that CD44 was hypermethylated and transcriptionally silenced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and most FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cell lines, but was usually unmethylated and expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concordant results were obtained from primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> material: CD44 was not methylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> patients (0/11) whereas CD44 was frequently hypermethylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients (18/29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cell lines with CD44 hypermethylation, expression was re-inducible at <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels by treatment with the DNA demethylating agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi>, confirming epigenetic regulation of CD44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD44 ligation assays with a monoclonal anti-CD44 antibody showed that CD44 can mediate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in CD44+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CD44 hypermethylated, CD44- <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines were consistently resistant towards anti-CD44 induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data show that CD44 is epigenetically regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and undergoes de novo methylation in distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes like <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus CD44 may be a promising new epigenetic marker for diagnosis and a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
