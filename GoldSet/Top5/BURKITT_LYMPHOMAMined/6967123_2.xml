<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Among 165 human B-cell lines examined, 57 were found to have karyotypic abnormalities that involved <z:hpo ids='HP_0003220'>chromosome breakage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sites of breakage were identified with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8711">quinacrine</z:chebi>-, Giemsa-, and reverse-banding techniques, and the distribution of 239 break points was plotted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A pronounced excess of telomeric and, to a lesser extent, centromeric breaks was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomes No. 7, 8, 9, 11, and 14 were involved in structural rearrangements more often and chromosomes No. 2, 5, 10, 20, and X less often than was predicted on the basis of their relative lengths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lines derived from patients with different categories of disorders varied in the distribution of break points throughout the karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this sample of cell lines, No. 8q; 14q translocations were found only in cultures derived from patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and were never observed to arise among other Epstein-Barr virus-carrying lines even after several hundred cell generations in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An additional feature, which was evidently restricted to lines derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, was the presence of interstitial insertion, deletion, or reduplication, particularly involving the long arm of chromosome No. 1 </plain></SENT>
