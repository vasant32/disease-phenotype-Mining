<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The characteristic chromosomal translocations that occur in certain human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> offer opportunities to understand how two gene systems can affect one another when they are accidentally juxtaposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the case of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, such a translocation joins the cellular oncogene, c-myc, to a region encoding one of the immunoglobulin genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In at least one example, the coding sequence of the rearranged c-myc gene is identical to that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gene, implying that the gene must be quantitatively, rather than qualitatively, altered in its expression if it is to play a role in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One might expect to find the rearranged c-myc gene in a configuration that would allow it to take advantage of one of the known immunoglobulin promoters or enhancer elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the rearranged c-myc gene is often placed so that it can utilize neither of these structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the level of c-myc <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> is often elevated in Burkitt cells, the translocation may lead to a deregulation of the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, since the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele in a Burkitt cell is often transcriptionally silent in the presence of a rearranged allele, a model for c-myc regulation is suggested that involves a trans-acting negative control element that might use as its target a highly conserved portion of the c-myc gene encoding two discrete transcriptional promoters </plain></SENT>
