<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exposure of cells from B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) to conjugate for less than 30 h had only a slight effect on cell growth, but on 48 h exposure a marked killing effect was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After recovery of growth, cells were re-exposed to conjugate for 9-14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of cells from the EB4 line (sIgG lambda) in this way yielded 4 variants which showed a marked reduction in levels of surface Ig lambda and secreted Ig lambda with slight, or no, reduction in MHC class II expression and similar growth rates to the parent line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variant lines retained their phenotype over long periods of culture </plain></SENT>
