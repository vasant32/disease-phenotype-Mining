<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Serum samples from 28 children with symptomatic human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were studied for the presence of HIV antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their humoral immune response profile, including anti-HIV specific isotypic responses and neutralizing titers, was characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, serum specimens from 12 of these children were tested for their ability to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against HIV envelope antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of our results showed that children with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>) were much more likely to have serum antigenemia and an absence of anti-p24 antibodies than those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001857" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">AIDS-related complex</z:e> (ARC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant association was also noted between a more stable clinical status and a strong anti-p24 antibody response with detectable antibodies to other HIV antigens in multiple antibody subclasses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the longitudinal evaluation of antigen/antibody profiles may aid in the assessment of prognosis for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sera from 6/6 patients with ARC and 4/6 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> were able to mediate ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between clinical status and the titers of neutralizing antibodies </plain></SENT>
