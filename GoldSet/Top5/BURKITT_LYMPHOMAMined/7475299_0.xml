<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A leukemic cell line, A1, derived from a child with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> was observed to have early B-cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When irradiated A1 cells were cultured with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells in presence of recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO), it stimulated burst forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to determine if other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells or cell lines also induce similar stimulation, we used different leukemic cell lines and fresh B-cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> in bone marrow bioassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> leukemic cells induce BFU-Es </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To further identify the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell derived factor (LDF), A1 cells were lysed and differentially centrifuged to separate plasma membrane protein from cytosolic and nuclear proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only membrane associated protein were shown to induce BFU-E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when spent medium was collected and used in the bioassay, it also stimulated BFU-E, suggesting LDFs may be shed from plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To further identify LDF, A1 plasma membrane associated proteins were separated by ion-exchange FPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Protein fractions were collected and were used in the bioassay to identify the fraction that induced BFU-Es </plain></SENT>
