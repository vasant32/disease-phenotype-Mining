<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The organization of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene of B precursor cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) was examined in order to elucidate the mechanism causing simultaneous TCR gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study using a 5'D probe lying 20 kb upstream of IgH D region genes was useful to distinguish diversity(D)-joining(J) recombination(DJ) from variable(V)-DJ recombination(VDJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, IgH gene structures determined by 5'D study well correlated to those recognized by DJ or VDJ transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgH gene rearrangements of B precursor cell ALL showed developmentally restricted gene recombination; DJ/DJ genotype in the most immature stage and VDJ/VDJ genotype in the relatively mature stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B precursor cell ALL with simultaneous rearrangements were frequently found in relatively mature cells, i.e., CD20 expressing cells on their surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, most of such dual genotypic ALL showed that at least one allele of IgH genes was VDJ recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that dual genotype was the incidental product by a putative common recombinase during the process of VH gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, since IgH gene rearrangements of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> unclassified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with dual genotype were DQ52 genotype, which indicates abortive gene rearrangements, it was also thought that dual genotype occurred due to the pluripotentiality of the stem cell </plain></SENT>
