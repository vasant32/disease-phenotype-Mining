<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential effects of combination therapy using magnetic nanoparticles of Fe₃O₄ (MNP-Fe₃O₄) and chemotherapeutic drugs on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proliferation, inhibition, and viability of Raji cells were detected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and trypan blue exclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage of cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was detected by flow cytometry using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi>-annexin V and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p53 and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) protein levels were measured by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that proliferation of Raji cells was inhibited by adriamycin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> in a dose-and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell sensitivity was improved and the 50% inhibitory concentrations of adriamycin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> decreased when combined with a MNP-Fe₃O₄ carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in Raji <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was accompanied by upregulation of p53 protein and downregulation of NF-κB protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the combination of MNP-Fe₃O₄ with adriamycin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> increased p53 protein levels and decreased NF-κB protein levels more than adriamycin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> alone, indicating that MNP-Fe₃O₄ could enhance the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs on p53 and NF-κB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar results for cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and protein expression were not observed for the groups treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> ± MNP-Fe₃O₄ (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a potential clinical application for MNP-Fe₃O₄ in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> or adriamycin in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
