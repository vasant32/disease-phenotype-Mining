<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the loss of genetic material in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> has been documented by cytogenetic studies and microsatellite typing, a global overview of losses of heterozygosity occurring throughout the genome was not yet available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have performed a high resolution allelotype analysis in 63 childhood B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 247 microsatellite markers, evenly distributed along the autosomes were typed in blast and in remission samples from every patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An average of 41 patients were informative for each marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LOH at one or several loci was observed in 41 of the 63 patients (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean values for the fractional allelic loss (FAL) and the hemizygosity index, calculated for each patient, were 0.03 (range 0 to 0.23) and 0.024 (range 0 to 0.18), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequently involved chromosomal arms were 9p (36%), 12p (31%), 20q (15%), 6q (12%), 5p (10%) and 10p (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three regions on chromosomal arms 9p, 12p and 6q were previously identified as the targets of recurring deletions, the target genes being identified for two of them (9p and 12p) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The three new regions defined by this allelotype may contain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor genes implicated in the initiation or progression of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
