<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The status of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptors (LDLR) in Daudi Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells was examined using a flow cytometric assay employing the fluorescent ligand <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, and a radioligand-binding assay using [125I]<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The binding is concentration-and time-dependent; and is specific, as judged by its competitive displacement in the presence of unlabeled <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, and inhibition by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30740">EGTA</z:chebi>, and 4 degrees C incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The regulation of the receptor and its functional role were then explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest the following: (a) In sharp contrast to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood lymphocytes, the LDLR levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells are basally elevated when cultured in fetal bovine serum (FBS) medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(b) In accord with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood lymphocytes, incubation in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>-deficient serum (LPDS) medium further up-regulates the level of the receptor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, and co-incubation with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42977">25-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> down-regulates the receptor level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the up-regulation is significantly smaller than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(c) Northern blots using a plasmid-DNA probe for LDLR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> point to a similar pattern for message regulation as is observed in direct binding studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(d) Although the LDLR level is constitutively high in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, availability of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, unlike transferrin, is not a growth requirement since incubation of cells in LPDS medium does not prevent proliferation of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(e) In contrast to anti-transferrin receptor antibody which results in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> upon binding, anti-LDLR antibody does not inhibit growth or induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest LDLR is expressed at a significantly higher level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although up-regulation and down-regulation of LDLR are observed, this applies only to a small population of LDLR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The bulk receptor population is significantly resistant to down-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, notable differences in the functional role of the LDLR are found relative to the transferrin receptor which is also up-regulated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
