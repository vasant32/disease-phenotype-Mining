<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The 15;12 chromosome translocation in murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> and the 8;14 in human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> often link the cellular myc oncogene to the locus for constant regions of immunoglobulin heavy chains (CH locus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify how and why c-myc translocation occurs, we have sequenced the mouse and human c-myc genes and correlated c-myc transcription with c-myc rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both genes comprise three exons; the second and third encode the myc <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>, which is conserved between mammals and birds, particularly in its more basic C-terminal half </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Southern blots showed that four of 12 Burkitt lines have c-myc linked near CH switch regions and two near the joining region (JH) locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hence, immunoglobulin recombination machinery may participate in translocation, although the common myc breakpoint region around exon 1 does not resemble a switch region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumours</z:e> with breakpoints just 5' to exon 1, or distant from c-myc, had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> of 2.25 and 2.4 kb, which differ at their 5' ends, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> with breakpoints within exon 1 or intron 1 had altered c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> (2.1-2.7 kb in Burkitt lines), initiated within intron 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both types of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> probably yield the same <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since the untranslocated c-myc allele was generally silent, translocation to the CH locus must induce constitutive c-myc expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in immortal but non-tumorigenic lymphoblastoid cell lines may implicate c-myc in an immortalization step </plain></SENT>
