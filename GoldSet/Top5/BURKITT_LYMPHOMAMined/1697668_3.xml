<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell line, (NAB-2) deriving from a North American patient, exhibited a 8;22 (q22;q11-12) translocation involving the c-myc gene and lambda immunoglobulin genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, NAB-2 cells have two other consistent translocations: a 1;5 (p22;q23) and a 3;7 (p25;q22), with breakpoints close to the location of N-ras, fms, and raf-1 protooncogenes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization with myc, N-ras, and raf-1 radiolabeled DNA probes to NAB-2 chromosomes showed that none of these genes was relocated as a result of translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, by Northern blot analysis, the myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was represented by two transcripts, one approximately 2.4 kb and the other considerably larger (74 kb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The raf-1 gene transcript was also detected in NAB-2 cells; however, its size and level were similar to those seen in two other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the N-ras, fms, and fgr genes, which are frequently activated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, were not actively transcribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NAB-2 cells also have a chromatid defect visible as an achromatic region on the short arm of chromosome 2 near the locus of the kappa immunoglobulin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This alteration, which is a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> modification site caused by the Epstein-Barr virus or <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> products, had no influence on immunoglobulin synthesis, as NAB-2 cells concordant to the 8;22 translocation were positive for cytoplasmic and surface lambda light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although NAB-2 cells exhibit several chromosomal abnormalities, only translocation, 8;22 was associated with gene alterations relevant to the neoplastic development of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
