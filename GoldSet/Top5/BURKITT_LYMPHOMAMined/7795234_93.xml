<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The BCL-6 gene is known to be located on chromosome 3q27, at the breakpoint of the 3q27-associated translocations that occur frequently in human non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify the BCL-6 protein, two antibodies that recognized distinct domains of this protein were raised in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of lysates of BCL-6-expressing cells using both antibodies showed a broad 92- to 98-kD band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dephosphorylation of BCL-6 protein reduced the size of this band to 87 kD, suggesting that BCL-6 may be expressed in a phosphorylated form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining with both antibodies showed that BCL-6 protein was localized in the nuclei of most of the germinal center B cells and a small number of marginal zone B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, BCL-6 protein was expressed in follicular, Burkitt's, and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the BCL-6 protein, expressed in B cells of the germinal centers which are important in the maturation of immune responses, may play some physiological role(s) in the germinal center B cells </plain></SENT>
