<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathological and haematological diagnoses were reviewed, recoded according to International Classification of Diseases for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo>-3 and reclassified on the basis of ICCC-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sex and age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated, using the world population as standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five hundred and seventy-one HMs were registered in the Girona, Valencia and Zaragoza <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registries during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to ICCC-3, precursor cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> were the most frequent HMs in children and constituted 60% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HMs (an age-adjusted incidence rate of 42.7 per million children-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second most frequent childhood HM was Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (11.2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HMs), yielding an age-adjusted standardized incidence rate of 6.3 per million children-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With regard to myeloid lineage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemias</z:mpath> were the most frequent with a rate of 7.9 per million children-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The standardized incidence rates for lymphoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (1.19) and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (3.94) were statistically higher than the rates observed in Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with European data, Spain has a high incidence of lymphoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In particular, a high incidence of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
