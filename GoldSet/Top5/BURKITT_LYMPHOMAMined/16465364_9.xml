<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The comprehensive cytogenetic profiles of a panel of 10 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>)-derived B cell lines, designated Akata, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-28, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-41, Daudi, DG-75, Mutu I, Mutu III, Namalwa, Rael, and Ramos, respectively, are reported herein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The unique origin of each cell line was established using multiplex quantitative fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spectral karyotyping (SKY) revealed a large number of structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations, many of which had not been previously identified or resolved by conventional G-banding techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Notably, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 cell lines harbored the hallmark translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32), no other common structural aberrations were identified, although translocations involving chromosomes 3, 13, and 17 were frequently seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, analysis of chromosomal breakpoints by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) revealed a number of recurring aberrations, such as gain of chromosomes 7 and 20, gains of regions at 2p, 3q, 13q and 16q, and losses at 3p, 4q and 17p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, apoptyping (i.e. determination of in vitro responses to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> stimulation) of the cell lines suggested specific association patterns between karyotypic changes (e.g. translocations involving 17p, and gains of portions of chromosomes 7 and 20) and resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current molecular cytogenetic characterization of 10 BL cell lines has thus identified several novel sites of rearrangements; moreover, the combined karyotyping and functional assessment (apoptyping) of these cell lines serves to enhance their utility in future studies aimed at gene discovery and gene function </plain></SENT>
