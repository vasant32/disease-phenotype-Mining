<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the improving survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> due to better prevention and treatment of infectious complications, there may well be an increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280734" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AIDS-related malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV)-infected children in view of demographic data, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV disease</z:e> status, characters of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, and treatment outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Retrospective study was performed in HIV-infected children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> at Siriraj Hospital from January 1995 to October 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 6 year and 10 month period, there were 7 HIV-infected children (2 boys, 5 girls) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age at diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> was 3 years 7 months (2 years 6 months-5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>Hepatomegaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> were the most common presenting symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had NHL stage III or IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the predominant type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients were treated with appropriate chemotherapy and one patient also received antiretroviral therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only one patient with large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> stage IV who received both antiretroviral and chemotherapy has survived to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients died during chemotherapy treatment and one patient died before receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of these patients were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One of them with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> stage III also had central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) relapse at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mean survival time after diagnosis with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> was 11 months (15 days-3 years 1 month) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NHL is the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in HIV-infected children at Siriraj Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Age at presentation of NHL in these children is younger than their non-HIV counterpart </plain></SENT>
