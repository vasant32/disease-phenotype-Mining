<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined whether dCF and recombinant interferon-alpha A (rIFN-alpha A) were additive, synergistic, or antagonistic in their effects on the cultured B lymphoblastoid cell line Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment of Daudi cells for three to four days with doses of rIFN-alpha A that were growth inhibitory was unexpectedly found to increase the level of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity per cell two- to threefold and therefore to prevent the inhibition of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> by limiting concentrations of dCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the opposite effects of dCF and rIFN-alpha A on <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity did not lead to antagonistic effects on growth inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The higher concentrations of dCF (with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16335">deoxyadenosine</z:chebi>) necessary for appreciable growth inhibition could inhibit the increased <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity in rIFN-alpha A-treated cells, thus resulting in additive antiproliferative effects </plain></SENT>
