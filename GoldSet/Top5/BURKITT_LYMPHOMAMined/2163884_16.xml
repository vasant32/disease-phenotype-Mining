<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two clones were identical to an internal fragment of HeLa topo II cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The third clone, CAA5, had a different and novel sequence which shared significant nucleotide (62%) and predicted <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (70%) homologies with a region of the HeLa topo II cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that HeLa cells express at least two homologous forms of DNA topoisomerase II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The new HeLa topo II homologue is discussed in relation to topo II isoenzymes recently described in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and other cell lines </plain></SENT>
