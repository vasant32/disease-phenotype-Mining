<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken primarily to evaluate the relation of B and T cell markers in various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> to the currently accepted morphologic classifications and to determine the utility of various tissues in defining the cell of origin of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When histologically involved blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes or body fluids were studied, a B or T cell origin of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was identified in 26 of 28 (68 per cent) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A B cell origin was found in 17 adults classified as having nodular (N) or diffuse (D) poorly differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PDLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of T cell origin was observed in an adult with poorly differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-diffuse (PDLL-D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of PDLL-D in children were T cell in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The origin of American Burkitt's (stem cell) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in two children was the B cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When histologically involved blood was studied, a B or T cell origin was demonstrated in 10 of 21 (48 percent) adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evidence of a monoclonal proliferation of B lymphocytes in the blood was found two adults with more than 7 per cent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in Wright-Giemsa stained blood smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When neoplastic lymph nodes were studied, the diagnosis of a B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was made in 8 of 12 (67 per cent) adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Study of surface markers on malignant cells in cerebrospinal or serosal fluids frequently revealed a B or T cell origin of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>B and T lymphocyte numbers in the blood did not correlate with immunoglobulin or skin test abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in circulating B or T cell percentages at diagnosis were a poor prognostic sign in patients with PDLL-D </plain></SENT>
