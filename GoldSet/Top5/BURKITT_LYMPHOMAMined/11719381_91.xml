<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within EuroSIDA, a multicenter observational cohort of more than 8500 patients from across Europe, the incidences of NHL and subtypes (Burkitt, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e>, primary brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [PBL], and other/unknown histology) were determined according to calendar time of follow-up, and for those who initiated HAART (&gt; or =3 drugs) also time on HAART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Potential predictive factors of NHL were evaluated in Cox proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over 26 764 person-years of prospective follow-up (PYF) from May 1994 to December 2000, the incidence of NHL decreased from 1.99 (95% confidence interval, 1.51-2.47) before September 1995 to 0.30 (0.19-0.42) cases/100 (PYF) after March 1999 (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of NHL decreased significantly and most pronouncedly for PBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients who started HAART, the incidence of NHL decreased from 0.88 (0.60-1.16) within the first 12 months after starting HAART to 0.45 (0.31-0.60) cases/100 PYF after more than 24 months (P =.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an adjusted Cox model for patients on HAART, the latest CD4 cell count and plasma <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load were both significantly associated with diagnosis of NHL; the relative hazard was 1.39 (range, 1.14-1.69) per 50% lower CD4 cell count, and 1.51 (range, 1.21-1.88) per 1 log higher plasma <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the incidence of NHL among HIV-infected patients has decreased significantly after the introduction of HAART, and the decline was most pronounced for PBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After starting HAART, patients with insufficient immunologic and virologic responses were at highest risk of NHL </plain></SENT>
