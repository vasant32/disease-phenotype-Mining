<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The deregulation of expression of the c-myc gene in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> results from the translocation that links one c-myc allele to one of the immunoglobulin genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This physical linkage promotes interactions between c-myc and immunoglobulin gene regulatory elements that affect c-myc transcription initiation and elongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have located a region in the c-myc promoter that is required for the complete activation by the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This regulatory element contains a core sequence, GGGAGG, similar to the GA box recognized by the transcription factor Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>UV cross-link analysis indicated that the mass of this protein did not correspond to that of MAZ, suggesting that a protein related to but distinct from MAZ bound to this site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation of this regulatory element resulted in a loss of promoter activity induced by the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This site was also required for the c-myc promoter shift from P2 to P1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo footprinting revealed that this site was occupied on the translocated c-myc allele but not on the untranslocated allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings suggest that this regulatory element is required for the full activation of c-myc promoter activity by the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancer </plain></SENT>
