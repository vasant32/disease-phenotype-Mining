<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cell lines derived from the hemopoetic lineages are widely used as hosts for the production of biologicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cell lines have been demonstrated to undergo high levels of the active <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> program commonly referred to as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of overexpression of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> suppressor gene bcl-2 on the properties of a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were compared with the control cell line (transfected with a negative control plasmid) under a variety of conditions relevant to cell culture production technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In stationary batch cultures, there was a clear reduction in both the rate of total cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> during the decline phase of the bcl-2 transfected cell cultures as compared with that of the control cell cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nutrient analysis revealed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during the control cell cultures occurred following complete exhaustion of glutamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the bcl-2 transfected cell cultures continued to grow even though glutamine had been exhausted, and a significant decline in viability only occurred when <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> had also been completely exhausted.When cells were cultured in suspension without prior adaptation, the bcl-2 transfected cells grew significantly better, suggesting that the bcl-2 gene protected the cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> triggered by either the lack of substrate or the hydrodynamic environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence microscopy revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the control cells was almost entirely by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was almost exclusively by <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the delayed decline phase of the transfected cell cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both instances, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred before total exhaustion of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glutamine.The induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> following <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> is a major impediment to the development of culture strategies that optimize specific productivity by reducing the growth rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results presented here suggest that suppression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by bcl-2 under the condition of excess <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> allows the maintenance of cells in a growth-arrested state for much longer than would otherwise be possible.When cells were transferred to a range of commercial serum-free media, cell growth was, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, much better for the bcl-2 transfected cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, when cells were cultivated in glutamine-free medium, the control cells exhibited a decrease in viable cell number within the first 24 h whereas, for the bcl-2 transfected cell cultures, viable cell number did not exhibit any clear decrease until after 75 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clearly, these results indicate that the metabolic engineering approach can be used to alter advantageously the survival and proliferative capacity of cells in cell culture environments </plain></SENT>
