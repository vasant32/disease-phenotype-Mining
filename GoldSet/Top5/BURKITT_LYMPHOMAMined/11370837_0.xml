<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By PCR analysis we amplify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specific DNA sequences of clonal IgH rearrangement from a limited number of malignant cells against a background of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently described PCR based techniques for tracking <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) in B <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> have given promising but discordant results, with significant variations in the sensitivity and specificity of the procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have developed a three step single strand conformational polymorphism polymerase chain reaction (SSCP-PCR) strategy which is able to detect clonal malignant cells in B <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> at a frequency as low as 1 in 10(6) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since this method is simple, rapid, reliable and as specific as ASO-PCR, it could be especially useful in monitoring patients affected by B <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> in complete haematological and immunophenotypic remission </plain></SENT>
