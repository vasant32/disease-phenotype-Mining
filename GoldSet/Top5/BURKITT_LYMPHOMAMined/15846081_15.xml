<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor that has shown some promising results as an anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the question arose as to whether or not its COX-2-inhibitory function is required for its anti-tumorigenic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore employed dimethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> (DMC), which is a close structural analog of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> that lacks COX-2-inhibitory function, to investigate this question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By performing a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, we found that DMC potently mimics <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the anti-proliferative and anti-tumorigenic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cell culture, DMC effectively inhibits cell proliferation through the down-regulation of cyclins A and B and the ensuing loss of cyclin-dependent kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect appears to take place in vivo as well and results in significantly (p&lt;.002) reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in experimental animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results demonstrate that the anti-proliferative and anti-tumorigenic properties of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> and DMC are indistinguishable, at least in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, and therefore, that the COX-2-inhibitory function is not required for these effects </plain></SENT>
