<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry of lineage markers is useful in the classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess whether the study of lineage genes at the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> level would enable differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e>) from B-and T-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemias</z:hpo> (ALLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of four lineage markers [CD19, CD79a, CD3e, and myeloperoxidase (MPO)] by reverse transcription followed by real-time quantitative (RTQ)-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated 72 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> (40 AMLs with 23-93% blast cells plus 27 B-lineage ALLs and 5 T-lineage ALLs) defined by morphologic criteria at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RTQ-PCR analysis was performed on bone marrow without cell sorting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of each gene was calculated as the difference in the threshold cycle [DeltaCT; CT value of target gene minus CT value of housekeeping gene (Abelson)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patterns of expression were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the first, CD19, CD79a, and MPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were less abundant than CD3e </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the second pattern, MPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was more abundant than the other three <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the third, CD19 or CD79a was more highly expressed than CD3e and MPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The three patterns corresponded to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of cutoffs to establish qualitatively the pattern of coexpression of the four lineage markers provided the same information as the comparison among the four DeltaCT values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prospective use of the scoring system correctly classified each of 13 additional cases (8 AML, 4 B-lineage ALL, and 1 T-lineage ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Study of lineage markers at diagnosis by RTQ-PCR allows differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> without cell sorting, even when the bone marrow contains few blast cells </plain></SENT>
