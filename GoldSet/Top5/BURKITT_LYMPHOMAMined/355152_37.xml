<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chromosome studies were performed on malignant cells obtained from 27 patients with non-Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A marker chromosome affecting the long arm of No. 14 (14q+) was the single most frequent abnormality and was noted in 17 of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the 14q+ marker varied with the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, histiocytic, the frequency was 5 of 8; for mixed-cell type, 1 of 3; for poorly differentiated lymphocytic, 8 of 8; for well-differentiated lymphocytic, 0 of 3; for lymphoblastic, 0 of 1; for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, 2 of 3; and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e>, 1 of 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The donor chromosome involved in the 14q translocation was identified in 12 cases; certain chromosomes appeared to be affected more frequently than others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the break point was band 14q32 in most cases, the exact location of the receptor site on 14q was not always consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distal part of 14q24 was also involved as a receptor site in at least one translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that, in some types of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, cells with a 14q translocation have a proliferative advantage over cells with other chromosome rearrangments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of the 14q translocation may be important in the future for the distinction among morphologically different, but functionally comparable, subgroups of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
