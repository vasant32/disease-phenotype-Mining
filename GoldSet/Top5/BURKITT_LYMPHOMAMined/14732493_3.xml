<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of susceptible B cells occurs in response to surface IgM cross-linking mediated by self-antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This effect can be mimicked in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line BL60-2 by addition of anti-IgM antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to identify genes with differential expression in response to the apoptotic stimulus, total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> prepared from BL60-2 cells before and at different points in time after IgM cross-linking was used for Atlas arrays, high-density oligonucleotide microarrays (GeneChip arrays, Affymetrix) and in RNase protection assays (RPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of our major observations was the downregulation of six genes involved in the ligation of DNA strand breaks, like DNA ligases and DNA-PK, indicating a shutdown of DNA repair mechanisms in apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found changes on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level for several transcription regulators, including early growth response genes 1 and 2, TAFII30 and topoisomerase I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show accumulation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for the phosphatases CD45 and DUSP5 in anti-IgM stimulated BL60-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data provide a basis for further analysis of the differentially expressed genes and their roles in IgM-induced B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as well as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in other cellular systems </plain></SENT>
