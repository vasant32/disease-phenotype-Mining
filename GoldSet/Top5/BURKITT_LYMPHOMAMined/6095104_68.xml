<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> is characterized by chromosome translocations; usually the terminal portion of chromosome 8 containing the c-myc gene is translocated to chromosome 14, near the enhancer of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Less frequent are translocations of chromosome 8 to the kappa light-chain locus of chromosome 2 or to the lambda light-chain locus of chromosome 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro, EBV induces B cells to proliferate and secrete immunoglobulin and antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in vivo the infected B lymphocytes are under immunological control, so that abnormal proliferation is found only in immunosuppressed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such patients are subsequently liable to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Burkitt believed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> he had described resulted from interaction between a virus(es) and a "reticuloendothelial system altered by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and heavy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by malarial or other parasites" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We report here that during an attack of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024535" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Plasmodium falciparum malaria</z:e>, T-cell subpopulations are radically altered so that, in vitro, B lymphocytes infected with EBV proliferate abnormally to secrete large amounts of immunoglobulin and antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon offers some explanation for the increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumour</z:e> and the high levels of immunoglobulin found in people living in areas where P. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024535" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">falciparum malaria</z:e> is common </plain></SENT>
