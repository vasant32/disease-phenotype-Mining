<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, bispecific mAbs (bsAbs) were recombinantly constructed from veltuzumab (humanized anti-CD20) and epratuzumab (humanized anti-CD22) and evaluated in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While none of the parental mAbs alone or mixed had notable antiproliferative activity against Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells when not cross-linked, the bsAbs [eg, anti-CD20 IgG-anti-CD22 (scFv)(2)] were inhibitory without cross-linking and synergistic with B-cell antigen (BCR)-mediated inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bsAbs demonstrated higher antibody-dependent cellulary cytoxicity (ADCC) activity than the parental mAbs, but not complement-dependent cytoxicity (CDC) of the parental CD20 mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cross-linking both CD20 and CD22 with the bsAbs resulted in the prominent redistribution of not only CD20 but also CD22 and BCR into <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, appreciable translocation of CD22 into <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts was also observed after treatment with epratuzumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the bsAbs inhibited Daudi <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> transplant growth, but showed a significant advantage over the parental anti-CD20 mAb only at the highest dose tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that recombinantly fused, complementary, bispecific, anti-CD20/22 antibodies exhibit functional features distinct from their parental antibodies, perhaps representing new candidate therapeutic molecules </plain></SENT>
