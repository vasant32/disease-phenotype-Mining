<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 54-year-old man with primary gastric Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was evaluated for appetite loss and intermittent midepigastric pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upper gastroduodenal endoscopy detected an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> in the lesser curvature of the body, and biopsy specimens revealed infiltration of medium-sized lymphoblasts with "starry sky" macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The infiltrated cells were positive for a B-cell marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated marked enlargement of the gastric wall, but no enlargement of lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings led us to diagnose primary gastric Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient responded dramatically to CHOP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) chemotherapy, but 6 months after his initial admission, the disease recurred in the stomach and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lymphoblastic cells were positive for B-cell markers (CD 10, 19, 20, and human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-DR) and showed an abnormal karyotype, 47, XY, t(8;14)(q24;q32), +12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these cells, the Epstein-Barr virus genome was detected by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis revealed rearrangement of Ig heavy and light chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, c-myc gene rearrangement was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eight months after the beginning of chemotherapy, the patient died of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first description of a genetic analysis of primary gastric Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
