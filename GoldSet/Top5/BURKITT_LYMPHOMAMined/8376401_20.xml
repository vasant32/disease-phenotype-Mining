<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a previous study we demonstrated that the differentiation agent <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> causes a rapid reduction in the expression of c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in the rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line SW837 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This effect was blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> causes the induction of an activity that has a negative effect on c-myc expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present work we demonstrate that the rapid decrease in the level of c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, upon treatment of SW837 cells with 2 mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, is followed by a slower decrease in the level of p53 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and an increase in the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> levels for fibronectin and a placental type alkaline phosphatase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using in vitro elongation of nascent transcripts to measure transcription and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> chase experiments to measure <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> stability, we show that the reduction in expression of c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> is due to an increase in the block to transcriptional elongation, rather than a decrease in transcriptional initiation or an increase in degradation of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> induces an activity that increases the transcriptional block in SW837 cells, and that regulation of transcriptional elongation is an important mechanism for regulating c-myc expression in this cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A shift in relative usage of the two major promoters in the c-myc gene accompanies the reduction in expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The potential significance of this finding with respect to transcriptional elongation is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the exon 1/intron 1 boundary region of the c-myc gene cause an increase in transcriptional elongation in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We sequenced this region in a series of cell lines derived from colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which had an elevated level of c-myc expression, to determine if a similar mutational mechanism is at work in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the lines examined had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc DNA sequence, suggesting that the deregulation of c-myc expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> is not due to a cis mutation in this region </plain></SENT>
