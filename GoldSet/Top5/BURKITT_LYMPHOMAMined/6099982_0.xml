<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only one of these patients who had a solitary spinal-cord involvement by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) was considered to have primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of NS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other cases, NS was only secondarily involved by MLPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was most commonly observed in association with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and occurred in 49.3 and 67% of such patients who were previously untreated or previously treated, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>Nervous</z:mp> system (NS) involvement at presentation was much less commonly observed in non-Hodgkin's (NHL), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) at the rate of 6.7, 4.4 and 0% respectively of previously untreated patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intra-cranial NS disease was identified as a poor prognostic feature as this was associated with a reduction of the probability of prolonged survival from 48% to less than 20% among patients with intra-cranial and/or extra-cranial disease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Management of MLPD with high rate of NS involvement should include effective delivery of chemotherapy into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CFS</z:e>, both by direct injection intrathecally and through filtration across the blood-brain barrier following high-dose intravenous injection of agents like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
