<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new human cell line, WSU-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, was established from a malignant ascitic fluid occurring in a patient with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The established line grows in a single-cell suspension with a doubling time of 19 hours and expresses L3 morphologic features by the French-American-British classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunologic study revealed that WSU-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells express IgM-lambda both in the cytoplasm and on the surface and react with monoclonal antibodies to B-cell antigens (B1, B4, BL3, BL4, HLA-DR, and common <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> antigen [CALLA]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cells are negative for T-cell and myeloid/monocyte antigens as well as Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that WSU-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> corresponds to an intermediate stage of B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and WSU-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells had a hyperdiploid karyotype carrying the 8;14 chromosome translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies showed that WSU-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> has a rearrangement of c-myc proto-oncogene and expresses c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">Phorbol ester</z:chebi> 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were able to induce several phenotypic changes on WSU-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of total cellular protein showed that either <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> or IFN-gamma induced both the synthesis or loss of several proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the protein patterns indicated that some proteins were uniquely responsive to either <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> or IFN-gamma and others were common to both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This cell line should be valuable for future studies of cell proliferation, differentiation, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> concerning this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
