<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the clinical benefit of the prophylactic use of urate oxidase in children with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), we analyzed the incidence and complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor lysis syndrome</z:e> (TLS) in children with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) or stage III/IV Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) level &gt; or =500 U/l before and after the introduction of a protocol amendment to use urate oxidase for the prophylaxis of TLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from 1791 children with NHL enrolled in the two subsequent multicenter studies NHL-BFM 90 and 95 were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of the side effects TLS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100519'>anuria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, and other complications during the first 2 weeks after admission were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Until March 1996, no urate oxidase was used (period 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From November 1997 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> or stage III and IV B-NHL and LDH &gt; or =500 U/l should receive urate oxidase prophylactically (period 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In between (period 2), urate oxidase was given in a minority of hospitals therapeutically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initial chemotherapy was identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 78 children (4.4%) developed a TLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> had the highest risk to develop a TLS (26.4%) followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>/Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a LDH &gt; or =500 U/l (14.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In period 1, 16.1% and 9.2% of the latter children developed a TLS or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100519'>anuria</z:hpo>, respectively, compared to 12.3% and 6.2% in period 3 ( p=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> remained unchanged (5.0% vs 4.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> the differences in the incidence of TLS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100519'>anuria</z:hpo> between period 3 and period 1 were more pronounced, reaching significance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100519'>anuria</z:hpo> (15.4% vs 3.8%, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that patients with the highest risk to develop a TLS might benefit from the prophylactic use of urate oxidase </plain></SENT>
