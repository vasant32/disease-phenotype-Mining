<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now report cytokinetic and DNA ploidy findings of the rare L3 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry analysis of nineteen samples was performed by simultaneous DNA-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> staining with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51739">acridine orange</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DNA indices and cell cycle distributions were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-index of the G0/G1 cells was 17.9 +/- 8.7 and the number of cells in S phase and S + G2M were 21 +/- 10.6 and 28.0 +/- 13.9 percent respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was found in 6/19 (31.6%) and in two cases multiple aneuploid cell lines were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and multiple abnormal stemlines adversely affected survival (p less than 0.05), while kinetic parameters did not affect survival (p greater than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cytokinetic data are significantly different (S phase and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-I; p less than 0.001) than previously reported for the L1 and L2 ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormal DNA stemlines were found in cases with no detected cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that L3 ALL is characterized by significantly increased proliferation and provides a means for a flow cytometric identification of this subtype as compared to L1 and L2 ALL </plain></SENT>
