<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the new trifunctional antibody, Bi20 (FBTA05, anti-CD20 x anti-CD3), that connects B cells and T cells via its variable regions and recruits FcgammaRI(+) accessory immune cells via its Fc region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bi20 mediated efficient and specific lysis of B-cell lines and of B cells with low CD20 expression levels that were derived from CLL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, T-cell activation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell killing occurred in an entirely autologous setting without additional effector cells in 5 of 8 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In comparison, rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal CD20 antibody, demonstrated a significantly lower B-cell eradication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, Bi20, but not rituximab, upregulated the activation markers CD25 and CD69 on both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the presence of accessory immune cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD14(+) accessory cells and the monocyte cell line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 were activated via binding of the Fc region of Bi20, given that T cells were simultaneously engaged by the antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bi20 induced a strong Th1 cytokine pattern characterized by high IFN-gamma and very low IL-4 secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Bi20 may offer new immunotherapeutic options for the treatment of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
