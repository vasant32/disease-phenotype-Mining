<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single institutional study we evaluated the epidemiological, clinical, immunological, virological, histopathological and the outcome of eleven HIV/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients with oral cavity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (OCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine were males and seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860112" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">intravenous drug abusers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median of age was 33 years and the median of CD4 T cell counts at the time of diagnosis was 97 cell/µL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> presented as large and ulcerated masses involving the gingiva, the palate and the jaw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>); three were Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and the final case was a plasmablastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was found in three of the ten tested cases by in situ hybridization (EBER 1 and 2 probes) and immunohistochemistry (LMP-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e> virus-8 (HHV-8) was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in only one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients died without specific treatment; four received chemotherapy and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and three of them presented a prolonged survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Combination of HAART and chemotherapy should modify the poor prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients with OCL </plain></SENT>
