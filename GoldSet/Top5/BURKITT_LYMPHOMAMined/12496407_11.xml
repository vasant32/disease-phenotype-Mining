<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the cross-linking of cluster of differentiation (CD)24 induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and that this phenomenon can be enhanced by a B cell Ag receptor (BCR)-mediated signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we extend our previous observation and report that CD24 also mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in human precursor-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines in the pro-B and pre-B stages accompanying activation of multiple caspases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, simultaneous cross-linking of pre-BCR clearly inhibited CD24-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in pre-B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also observed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were involved in the regulation of this apoptotic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-BCR cross-linking induced prompt and strong activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1, whereas CD24 cross-linking induced the sustained activation of p38 MAPK, following weak extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SC68376, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, inhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction by CD24 cross-linking, whereas anisomycin, an activator of p38 MAPK, enhanced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK-1, enhanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction by CD24 cross-linking and reduced the antiapoptotic effects of pre-BCR cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, whether pre-B cells survive or die may be determined by the magnitude of MAPK activation, which is regulated by cell surface molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings should be important to understanding the role of CD24-mediated cell signaling in early B cell development </plain></SENT>
