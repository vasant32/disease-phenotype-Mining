<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: [corrected] <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> as well as leukemic B-cell progenitors were examined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: [corrected] In a survey of the expression of a broad range of signal transduction molecules, the Src-family protein tyrosine kinases were found to be differentially expressed in early B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>[corrected] Analysis of freshly prepared precursor-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> cells and B-lineage cell lines showed Hck and Lyn are major Src-family protein tyrosine kinases expressed in this type of leukemic blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>[corrected] However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of Hck and Lyn expression was found in these cells, and precursor-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> cells subsequently were classified according to the expression pattern of Hck and Lyn as Hck/Lyn dual-negative, Hck-predominant, Hck/Lyn dual-positive, and Lyn-predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further studies on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-lineage cells indicated that the Src-family protein tyrosine kinases are expressed sequentially in a differentiation-dependent fashion during B-cell ontogeny and that the predominant expression of Hck is a common feature in B-cell progenitors, whereas Lyn expression is more significant in mature B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the biologic significance remains unknown, sequential expression of Src-family protein tyrosine kinases should play a role in regulation of early B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
