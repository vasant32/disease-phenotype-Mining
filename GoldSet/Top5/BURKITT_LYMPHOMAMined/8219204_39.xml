<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>p53 overexpression has been found to be a fairly common feature in high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the majority of tumoral cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results vary from series to series, from 25% to 33% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess whether immunohistochemical positivity for p53 correlated with the presence of structural gene abnormalities, DNA from 16 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with high and low p53 values was amplified and sequenced to determine the existence of point mutations in the highly conserved regions of the p53 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the group of 8 cases containing high levels of protein, 3 cases showed missense point mutations at the codons mapping between exons 5 through 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 8 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> containing undetectable or low levels of p53 protein, 1 case presented a nonsense point mutation giving a stop codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No missense mutations were detected in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The finding of p53 mutations in 4 of 16 cases confirms the presence of p53 gene mutations in high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> distributed over different histologic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These include Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, together with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e>, and large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the absence of mutations in 5 of the 8 cases that overexpressed p53 suggests that the nuclear or cytoplasmic stabilization of p53 protein could also depend on other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The absence of detectable levels of p53 protein cannot discount the existence of p53 mutations, as is shown by a case of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in which a nonsense mutation was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The impact of this range of p53 alterations on clinical course and treatment response of the patients deserves to be explored, in an attempt to differentiate the specific consequences of each one </plain></SENT>
