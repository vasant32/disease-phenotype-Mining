<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This dynamic stretch of DNA can form at least three different topologies: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi>, or higher order secondary structures that silence transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current report, we identify the ellipticine analog GQC-05 (NSC338258) as a high affinity, potent, and selective stabilizer of the MYC G-quadruplex (G4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cells, GQC-05 induced cytotoxicity with corresponding decreased MYC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and altered protein binding to the NHE III(1) region, in agreement with a G4 stabilizing compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further describe a unique feature of the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line CA46 that allowed us to clearly demonstrate the mechanism and location of action of GQC-05 within this region of DNA and through the G4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, these data present, as far as we are aware, the most direct evidence of intracellular G4-mediated control of a particular promoter </plain></SENT>
