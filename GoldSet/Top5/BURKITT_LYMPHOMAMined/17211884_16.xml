<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A paradigm is the activation of the c-myc gene by chromosomal translocations in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite expression of a restricted set of Epstein-Barr <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> (EBV) antigens, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells are not recognized by antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) because of their inability to process and present HLA class I-restricted antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cells of EBV-driven posttransplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> (PTLD) are recognized and rejected by EBV-specific CTLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether the poor immunogenicity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells is due to nonexpression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigens, overexpression of c-myc, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To understand the basis for immune recognition and escape, we have compared the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression profiles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and EBV-immortalized cells (as PTLD model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the genes expressed at low level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, we have identified many genes involved in the NF-kappaB and interferon response that play a pivotal role in antigen presentation and immune recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a cell line in which EBNA2 and c-myc can be regulated at will, we show that c-MYC negatively regulates STAT1, the central player linking the Type-I and Type-II interferon response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Switching off c-myc expression leads to STAT1 induction through a direct and indirect mechanism involving induction of Type-I interferons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>c-MYC thus masks an interferon-inducing activity in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings imply that immune escape of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells is not only a matter of in vivo selection but may be additionally promoted by activation of a cellular oncogene </plain></SENT>
