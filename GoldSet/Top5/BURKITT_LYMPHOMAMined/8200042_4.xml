<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human peripheral gamma delta T cells, coexpressing the V gamma 9/V delta 2 chains of the T cell receptor, lyse Daudi cells but not Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have screened four other Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (HH514, DG75, Ramos, and Wilson), as well as cells derived from a fresh Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, to see if any of them can be recognized by human gamma delta T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo>-derived lines MOLT-4, CEM, and K562 have also been included in these studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> tested, only Daudi, DG75, and HH514 could be lysed by V gamma 9/V delta 2+ T cell clones derived from the peripheral blood of healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These T cell clones were also able to lyse the NK sensitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> lines K562 and MOLT-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When bulk cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were cultured with different Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines, only Daudi stimulated the outgrowth of gamma delta T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, only Daudi cells could stimulate proliferation of gamma delta T cell clones, and the response was enhanced significantly in the presence of interleukin-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data and our prior observations showing the use of the V gamma 9/V delta 2 TCR type by Daudi-reactive human gamma delta T cells indicate that Daudi cells are not representative of other Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
