<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are occasionally found in other B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Translocations involving the heavy chain locus (IGH) place the MYC gene either in cis with both the intronic enhancer Emu and the IGH 3' regulatory region (3'RR) or in cis with only the 3'RR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The result is deregulated MYC expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have led to some controversy as to when, during B lymphocyte development, IGH/MYC chromosome translocations take place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A related issue, relevant not only to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> development but also to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls on IGH gene expression, is the stage, during B lymphocyte development, at which the 3'RR is capable of activating MYC expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have developed mice transgenic for a human MYC (hMYC) gene under control of the four core enhancers from the mouse Igh 3'RR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unlike other transgenic mouse models where premature and inappropriate MYC expression disrupts <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell development, the hMYC transgene in these studies carries a mutation that prohibits MYC protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a result, hMYC expression can be analyzed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data show that hMYC is expressed almost exclusively in B-lineage cells and is induced to high levels as soon as bone marrow cells reach the immature B cell stage </plain></SENT>
