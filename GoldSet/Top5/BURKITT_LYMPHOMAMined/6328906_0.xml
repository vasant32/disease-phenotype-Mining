<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a methodology suitable for the large scale production and partial purification of human lymphoblastoid interferon with a minimum expense and reasonable (10%) degree of purity of product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells used were Namalwa lymphoblastoid cells, which have the advantage of being both easy to grow and well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum to a density of 1.5 - 2 X 10(6) cells/ml and then diluted 50% by the addition of serum free medium containing 2mM <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 48 hours, the medium was removed and the cells induced to produce interferon by Sendai virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Typical initial interferon titres were in the region of 4 - 4.8 log units/ml, while specific activities were in the region of 10(6) units/mg protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The initial stage in the purification involved batchwise adsorption of the interferon to Procion red- HE7B <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> CL6B  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> was then packed into a column, washed with 0.5M KC1 and the interferon eluted with 2M KC1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The interferon was further purified by gel filtration to give an activity of approximately 10(7) units/mg protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Yields were between 30-50% of the initial interferon in a volume of 25 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further separation of the components of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> alpha interferon could be obtained on Procion blue-HER <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi>, or by utilizing reverse phase HPLC </plain></SENT>
