<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of action of the compound remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we have analyzed the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> on the cell proliferation of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> could effectively inhibit the growth of Raji cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further studies indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> treatment resulted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis showed that the expression of Bax, Bid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> C were up-regulated, while the expression of oncogene c-Myc was down regulated after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, poly (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP) cleavage was induced by the compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 expression was not significantly changed in Raji cells after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that the mechanism of action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> was to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> damage and therefore led to Raji cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We further investigated the in vivo effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> on the growth of xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> could effectively inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in the xenograft mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> could suppress the growth of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in both in vitro and in vitro systems </plain></SENT>
