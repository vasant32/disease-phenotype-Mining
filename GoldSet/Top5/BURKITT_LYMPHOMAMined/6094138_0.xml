<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using micro-titre plates has been established for determination of IgG and IgA antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated early antigen complex (EA) and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (VCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results obtained correlated well with the antibody titre determinations by the standard immunofluorescence technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ELISA was found to be about 15 to 30 times more sensitive than the immunofluorescence assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of its high sensitivity, specificity and rapid performance the enzyme-immunoassay is a useful tool for large scale epidemiological studies of EBV-associated diseases as well as for the early diagnosis and monitoring of patients with EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>: Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgA antibody titres to EA and VCA were determined in sera obtained from healthy controls, patients with EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> and various diseases known to be associated with EBV-reactivation, i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Except in sera of patients with nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, IgA antibodies to VCA and EA could only be detected at a rather high frequency (36% IgA anti-VCA+, 21% IgA anti-EA+) and in substantial titres in sera obtained from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_339'>lymphatic leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
