<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Macrophages were observed to show evidence of toxicity when exposed to lower concentrations of Imuthiol than inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation by the Raji lymphoid cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the mitogenic response of human mononuclear cells to phytohaemaglutinin (PHA) occurred after preincubation of adherent or non-adherent mononuclear cells with Imuthiol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This finding contrasts with the results with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33972">gold salts</z:chebi> where preincubation of adherent cells inhibits the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi>, while preincubation of non-adherent cells has no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specific toxicity of gold on monocyte/macrophages in vitro is not a feature of Imuthiol </plain></SENT>
