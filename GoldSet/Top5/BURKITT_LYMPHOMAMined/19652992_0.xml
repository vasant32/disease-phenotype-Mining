<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on the effects of rituximab treatment in combination with irradiation are, however, limited and inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to investigate the effects of rituximab (R) on cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by X-irradiation in Raji <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and to evaluate its mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found the cell growth inhibition by irradiation was enhanced by additional rituximab exposure both in cells precultured with rituximab followed by irradiation (R + irradiation) or in cells treated in the reverse sequence (irradiation + R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>R + irradiation combination treatment induced more apoptotic cells than irradiation and irradiation + R treatment as early as 12 h after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 h, both combination treatments, R + irradiation and irradiation + R, showed apoptotic cells, which were significantly different from irradiation alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>G2/M cell cycle arrest was observed after irradiation alone and the combination treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination treatment revealed an elevation in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in a radiation dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, rituximab enhanced the cell growth inhibition and apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by the oxidative agent, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that rituximab mediates a significant in vitro radiosensitizing effect and induces cell cycle changes and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ROS probably play an important role in these events </plain></SENT>
