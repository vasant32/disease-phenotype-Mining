<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxic T cells (Tc) can be primed in vitro to specifically kill autologous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lymphoblastoid cell line cells (LCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antigen recognized by Tc on the LCL cells is designated LYDMA (lymphocyte determined membrane antigen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recognition of LYDMA may also require simultaneous recognition of HLA determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite its immunogenic potency, the genetic origin and molecular structure of LYDMA remains undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most LCL cells do not produce EBV virus, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> LCL cells appear to express an immunogenic, non-HLA class I, 47,000 Dalton determinant which is detected by several independently derived mouse monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This determinant is not readily detected on peripheral blood lymphocytes, nor on EBV-associated Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined the potential relationship between this 47,000 MW Epstein-Barr virus associated cell surface antigen (the EBVCS antigen) and LYDMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Populations of Tc generated by in vitro activation with irradiated autologous LCL cells were potent at destroying EBVCS bearing autologous LCL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The addition of anti-EBVCS antibody to this cytotoxic interaction had no suppressive effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, single cell derived, LYDMA reactive, Tc clones able to specifically destroy autologous LCL were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity could be inhibited by monoclonal antibody to HLA-Class I determinants, but not by monoclonal antibodies to EBVCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, these LYDMA reactive Tc clones do not recognize the same antigenic determinant as the monoclonal antibodies specific for EBVCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It remains uncertain whether this 47,000 MW <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> that carries the serologically detected EBVCS antigen may be directly recognized by human T cells </plain></SENT>
