<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two EBV specific <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> each about 175 bases in length were synthesised and nuclease 51 mapping experiments determined that these in vitro products corresponded precisely to the in vivo species obtained from Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These two <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> molecules are transcribed by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase III and in common with other pol III-synthesised <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> the coding sequences contain intragenic control regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative abundance of the two <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> synthesised in vitro differs from that observed in vivo </plain></SENT>
