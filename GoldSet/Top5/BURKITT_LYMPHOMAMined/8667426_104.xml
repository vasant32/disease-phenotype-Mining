<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Arrest of the cell cycle in G2 phase following DNA damage helps protect cell viability by allowing time for DNA repair before entry into mitosis (M phase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abrogation of G2 arrest sensitizes cells to the effects of DNA-damaging agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37700">protein kinase C inhibitor</z:chebi> that may block G2 checkpoint regulation, has been reported to enhance the cytotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi>, a known DNA-damaging agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We studied the effect of UCN-01 on G2 checkpoint control in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> CA46 cells, whose sensitivity to various DNA-damaging agents and G2 response to DNA damage have been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the ability of UCN-01 to enhance the cytotoxicity of gamma irradiation in CA46 cells and human colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> HT-29 cells, both of which are mutant for p53 function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The influence of p53 function on UCN-01-mediated abrogation of the G2 checkpoint and enhancement of DNA-damaging agent cytotoxicity was studied in transfected human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> MCF-7 cells that either expressed or did not express the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850011,C0850009" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">human papillomavirus</z:e> type-16 E6 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MCF-7 cells have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> p53 function, and the E6 protein binds p53 protein and promotes its destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effect of UCN-01 on cell cycle arrest induced by gamma irradiation was studied in CA46 cells and in transfected MCF-7 cells by use of flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H1 phosphorylation assay was employed to measure cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase activity in extracts derived from irradiated and nonirradiated CA46 cells that had been either treated or not treated with UCN-01; the phosphorylation status of Cdc2 kinase protein in the same extracts was determined by use of western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect of UCN-01 on the cytotoxicity of gamma irradiation in CA46 and HT-29 cells was determined by use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">thiazolyl blue</z:chebi>) and clonogenic (colony-forming) assays, respectively; a clonogenic assay was also used to measure the effect of UCN-01 on the cytotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> in transfected and nontransfected MCF-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: G2 arrest induced in CA46 cells by gamma irradiation was minibited by treatment with UCN-01 in a dose-dependent manner; arrest in G2 was completely abrogated by exposure to 300 nM UCN-01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Biochemical markers indicative of the G2/M transition, including the activation of cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase and the suppression of Cdc2 threonine-14 and tyrosine-15 phosphorylation, were detected in irradiated cells treated with UCN-01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>UCN-01 enhanced the cytotoxicity of gamma irradiation in CA46 and HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MCF-7 cells with functional p53 protein were more resistant to G2 checkpoint abrogation by UCN-01 than MCF-7 cells with disrupted p53 function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>UCN-01 markedly enhanced the cell-killing activity of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> in MCF-7 cells defective for p53 function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: UCN-01 is a potent abrogator of G2 checkpoint control in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells with disrupted p53 function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>UCN-01 might be capable of enhancing the effectiveness of DNA-damaging agents in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with cells lacking <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> p53 function </plain></SENT>
