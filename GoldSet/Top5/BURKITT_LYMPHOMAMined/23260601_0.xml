<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">Nucleoside</z:chebi> analogues, including <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi>, and their precursors, have shown some efficacy against several Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated diseases, including active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and posttransplantation <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (PTLD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They have also been proposed as a possible treatment for EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including endemic Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> analogues in combination with chemotherapy in the developing world has not been studied and is necessary before any large scale efficacy trials are conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children 3-15 years old meeting inclusion criteria were assigned to a 3+3 dose escalation trial of combination <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35854">valacyclovir</z:chebi> (15 and 30 mg/kg, 3 times daily for 40 days) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CPM) (40 mg/kg day 1, 60 mg/kg on days 8, 18, and 28) or CPM monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were monitored for clinical and laboratory toxicity and had EBV levels measured regularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was our primary outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35854">valacyclovir</z:chebi> and CPM was safe and did not lead to any DLT compared with CPM monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common side effects were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site pain, which were similar in both arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with measurable serum EBV showed decreased loads over their treatment course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We recommend a phase II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35854">valacyclovir</z:chebi> dose of 30 mg/kg 3 times daily for 40 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also observed that 6 of our 12 patients with presumed Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had measurable EBV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> loads that decreased over the course of their treatment, suggesting that phase II studies should investigate this correlation further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study paves the way for a phase II efficacy trial of combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35854">valacyclovir</z:chebi> and CPM in the treatment of endemic Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
