<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, however, we reported that upon B cell receptor cross-linking and coculture with activated T cells, the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BL2 introduces mutations in its IgVH gene in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now confirm the relevance of our culture model by establishing that the entire spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> observed in vivo, including insertions and deletions, could be found in the DNA of BL2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we show that among four human B cell lines, only two with a centroblast-like phenotype can be induced to mutate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Triggering of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in BL2 cells requires intimate T-B cell contacts and is independent of CD40-CD40-ligand (CD40L) interactions as shown by 1) the lack of effect of anti-CD40 and/or anti-CD40L blocking Abs on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> and 2) the ability of a CD40L-deficient T cell clone (isolated from an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyper-IgM syndrome</z:e> patient) to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> in B cell receptor-engaged BL2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, our in vitro model reveals that T-B cell membrane interactions through surface molecules different from CD40-CD40L can trigger somatic hypermutation </plain></SENT>
