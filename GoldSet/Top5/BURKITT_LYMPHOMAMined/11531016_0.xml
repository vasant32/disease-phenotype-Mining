<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the expression of hybrid phenotype in 236 adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL; 188 B-lineage ALL and 48 T-lineage ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In B-lineage ALL, myeloid antigen (mAg) CD15 was concentrated in CD10-CD20- cases (49%); CD13 (42%); and CD33 (43%) in CD10+CD20- cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This trend had no correlation with the presence of Ph1 or t(4;11) chromosomal abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T-cell antigen CD2, CD4, and CD7 was seen in four, four, and two cases, respectively, and CD4+ and CD7+ cases commonly expressed CD13 and/or CD33 (CD13/CD33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In T-lineage ALL, expression of mAg, CD11b (47%), CD13 (38%), CD15 (28%), and CD33 (51%) was restricted to CD3- cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>B-cell antigen CD19 was found in two cases with CD7 solely as T-cell antigen, and these cases possessed CD13/CD33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD21 was detected in three cases with CD3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In whole ALL, CD13/CD33 was associated closely with the presence of stem-cell antigen CD34, and in T-lineage ALL, CD13/CD33 had a significant correlation with additional stem-cell features, such as HLA-DR, multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) and c-kit gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that immature ALL cells frequently express B+M+, T+M+, and occasionally B+T+M+ phenotype; that B+T+M- phenotype is extremely rare; and that mAg expression in B-lineage ALL is complicated as compared to T-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
