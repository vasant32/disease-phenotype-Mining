<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic C.B-17/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> bone marrow cells were engrafted poorly compared with syngeneic C3H/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> when transplanted into C3H/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> recipients, whereas cells of both strains were equally well engrafted into C.B-17/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C.B-17/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice were much more permissive for outgrowth of human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Raji), as well as for Epstein-Barr virus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> development after transplantation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human skin grafts were accepted by the C.B-17/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice but were promptly rejected by the C3H/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resistance to human RaJi cells could be adoptively transferred by infusion of C3H/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> splenocytes into C.B-17/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because the C.B-17/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> and C3H/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice equally lack both T and B lymphocytes, the latter may provide a relevant model for studies of non-T mechanisms of allograft or xenograft rejection </plain></SENT>
