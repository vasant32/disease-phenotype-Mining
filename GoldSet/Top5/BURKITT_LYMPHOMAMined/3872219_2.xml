<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Presence of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> during stimulation eliminated the requirement for specialized accessory cells in the response to cell mitogenic agents such as the lectin concanavalin A or treatment with neuraminidase and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antibodies directed against the T cell receptor-associated antigen T3 served as efficient stimuli, especially if aided by agents that cross-link immunoglobulin, indicating that a triggering signal is received by a T cell via aggregation of its antigen receptor complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Raji, was found to selectively trigger Jurkat cells, suggesting the ability of those cells to respond to certain foreign stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Jurkat cell line has been instrumental in the purification of IL 2 and cloning of the corresponding gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest it can also serve as a useful model for induction of T cell responses </plain></SENT>
