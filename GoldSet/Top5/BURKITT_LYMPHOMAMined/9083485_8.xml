<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these new derivatives, thiocolchicone (8), wherein an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48374">acetamido group</z:chebi> in thiocolchicine is replaced by a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> oxygen at C(7), was obtained from deacetythiocolchicine (6) by Schiffs base equilibration and acid hydrolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reduction of thiocolchiocone with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50985">sodium borohydride</z:chebi> yielded the racemic alcohol 9, the structure of which was verified by X-ray crystallographic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Optically pure alcohols 9a,b were obtained by treatment of 9 with the optically pure reagent (1S)-(-)-camphanic <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> followed by chromatographic separation of the camphanate <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> and hydrolysis of the diastereomers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>X-ray crystallographic analysis established the aS,7S-configuration of 9a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Racemic and optically active <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> 11-15, 11a,b, 12a, 14a, and 15a were obtained by esterification of the corresponding alcohols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The compounds showing activity equivalent to or greater than (-)-thiocolchicione (2a) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the biological assays were three (-)-aS,7S optically pure enantiomers: the alcohol 9a, the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> 11a (an oxygen isostere of thiocolchicine), and the isonicotinoate 15a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> 8 and two (-)-aS,7S enantiomers (12a, 14a) had high activity in the biochemical assays with tubulin but reduced antiproliferative activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, optically pure isomers with the (-)-aS,7S configuration exhibited greater biological activity than racemic mixtures or isomers or isomers with the (+)-aR,7R configuration </plain></SENT>
