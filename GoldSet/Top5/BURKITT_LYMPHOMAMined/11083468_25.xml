<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we use immunogold electron microscopy to evaluate the subcellular distribution of P32 protein (gC1q-R) in cultured cell lines and in rat tissues embedded in the acrylic resin LR Gold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunogold labeling of Raji <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>, human fibroblasts, HeLa and B-SC-1 cells shows reactivity primarily within mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Highly specific labeling of mitochondria is also obtained in rat tissues, including adrenal gland, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, heart, kidney, liver, pituitary, pancreas, skeletal muscle, spleen, testes and thyroid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, strong P32 (gClq-R) reactivity is also present in (i) zymogen granules, condensing vacuoles, endoplasmic reticulum, and on the cell surface of pancreatic acinar cells, (ii) on the cell surface of microvascular endothelial cells in pancreas and kidney, (iii) on the cell surface and in nuclei of splenic lymphocytes, and (iv) in the acrosome of developing spermatids in testes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western immunoblots show that the polyclonal antibody to P32 (gC1q-R) used in this study reacts specifically with a 32-kDa protein in both purified pancreatic zymogen granules and in mitochondria, and no other proteins are reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence that P32 (gC1q-R) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> protein that also localizes outside mitochondria in certain cells and tissues under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physiological conditions </plain></SENT>
