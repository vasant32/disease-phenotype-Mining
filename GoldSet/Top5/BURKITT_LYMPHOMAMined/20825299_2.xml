<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most solitary hyperfunctiong regions on thyroid scan consist of benign tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report a patient with a Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that was infilterated into a region containing a hyperfunctioning nodule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: A 56-year-old man was referred to our <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">Endocrine</z:chebi> Unit in May 2009 due to the incidental discovery of a large left thyroid lobe nodule by a computed tomography study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This had been performed to search for a primitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153690" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bone metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was clinically and biochemically thyrotoxic with no evidence of humoral thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nodule had a dyshomogenous appearance at neck ultrasonography, with multiple hypoechogenic areas and calcifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(99m)-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">Technetium</z:chebi> thyroid scintiscan revealed a hot nodule with suppression of the contralateral lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> cytology indicated the presence of neoplastic cells not of thyroid origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> was obtained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50673">methimazole</z:chebi>, and the patient was submitted to left lobe thyroidectomy and istmectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis of the surgical specimen led to a diagnosis of Burkitt-like large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> harbored within a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000854'>thyroid adenoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After further staging, the final diagnosis was stage IV E Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with the involvement of the bone and the thyroid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first description of an aggressive Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that infiltrated an hyperfunctioning <z:hpo ids='HP_0000854'>thyroid adenoma</z:hpo>, thus presenting as a hot nodule at thyroid scintiscan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In our patient there was no humoral or histological evidence of thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, thus suggesting a metastatic seeding of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> within the hyperfunctioning <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040137" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid nodule</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Involvement of the thyroid gland by Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is extremely rare as is close localization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and a hyperfunctioning <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040137" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid nodule</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As highlighted by the present report, performing fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> cytology should be always considered in the clinical context of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> of unknown origin or when there are ultrasonography signs suggesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, even when the nodule is hyperfunctioning </plain></SENT>
