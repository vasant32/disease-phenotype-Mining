<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since 1988, 68 patients with a median age of 34 years (range 16 to 56 years) received dose intensification, including 25 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in first remission (12 lymphoblastic or Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 13 large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with risk factors), 20 aggressive non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in chemosensitive relapse, and 23 Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in chemosensitive relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The calculated 3-year overall survival and relapse-free survival was 72% (CI: 57-82%) and 61% (CI: 47-73%) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were seen in 4.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median duration of hospitalization was 30 days (range 19-51 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relapse-free 3-year survival for the separate treatment groups was 80% for lymphoblastic and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in first remission, 77% for large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with clinical risk factors in first remission, 39% for aggressive non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in chemosensitive relapse, and 59% for Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in chemosensitive relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These excellent results were obtained with acceptable toxicity and justify the use of dose intensification for a group of young patients with high risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
