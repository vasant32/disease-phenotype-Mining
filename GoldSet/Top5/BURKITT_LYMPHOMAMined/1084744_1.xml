<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human lymphocyte population which exhibits "spontaneous" cytolysis of EB2 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells has been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effector cell has EA and EAC' receptors but lacks E receptors and probably surface Ig. "Spontaneous" anti-EB2 cytotoxicity was not reduced by preincubation of the effector cells with plastic or iron <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> or by passage through cotton wool or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> columns but was reduced by passage through nylon wool columns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thymocytes were not cytotoxic to EB2 cells, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> cells (of B cell characteristics) had reduced cytotoxicity compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells from various lymphoid organs of rats and guinea-pigs were also cytotoxic to EB2 cells with reactivity in spleen greater than or equal to blood greater than lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spleen cells from neonatally thymectomized rats had increased cytotoxicity compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat spleen cells, suggesting that T lymphocytes are not essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effector cell in rat spleen did not adhere to cotton wool or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> columns, indicating some resemblance to its counterpart in human peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
