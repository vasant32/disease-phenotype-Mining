<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This protein has an estimated molecular weight of 20,000 (20 kD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the 20-kD protein is enhanced only in the membranes of cells whose growth can be inhibited by IFN-beta (Daudi, WISH, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60, diploid fibroblasts) but not in the membranes of cells whose growth is not inhibited by IFN-beta (Namalva, Raji) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a correlation between the IFN-beta-enhanced 20-kD membrane protein and the inhibition of cell growth by IFN-beta </plain></SENT>
