<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Zeta-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70), a member of the Syk family of protein tyrosine kinases, is normally expressed in T and NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While little is known about ZAP-70 expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B cells, it has been reported that ZAP-70 is expressed in a subset of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the expression and phosphorylation status of ZAP-70 in B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (Blin-ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: First, ZAP-70 protein expression was assessed by Western blotting and flow cytometry and ZAP-70 mRNA transcripts were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on human precursor B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiments were then carried out on cells obtained from 18 patients with Blin-ALL and from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ZAP-70 was constitutively expressed and phosphorylated on tyr319 in human precursor Blin-ALL cell lines as well as in primary B leukemic cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined Blin-ALL patients with pro-B, pre-B and B phenotypes, but not in malignant myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow revealed expression of ZAP-70 transcripts only in the CD34+ cell fraction (either CD19-CD10- or CD19+CD10+) but not in the CD34- cell fraction (CD19+sIgM- pre-B cells or CD19+sIgM+ immature B cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: ZAP-70 was found to be expressed in the CD34+ <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow compartment including earlier B-cell progenitors, but not in CD34- pre-B and immature B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, ZAP-70 was consistently expressed and phosphorylated in Blin-ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to determine whether ZAP-70 may play a pathophysiological role in Blin-ALL </plain></SENT>
