<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>5,10-MTHF is required for conversion of uridilate to thymidylate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other side, MTHFR enzyme causes methylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> into methionine, leading to methylation of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapeutic agents have different effects, but DNA is the target for most of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> is the cornerstone in DNA synthesis, we analysed herein if the polymorphisms in MTHFR gene can alter the susceptibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> risk and if it has an effect on chemotherapy response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifty-six patients with lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and 82 healthy controls were included into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither gene frequencies nor allel frequencies were found to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> risk significantly in both overall group and subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although it was not statistically significant, we found a 2.7-fold increased risk in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL)/Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients with TT genotype [odds ratio (OR), 2.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.88-8.2] than CC genotype but a 1.7-fold decreased risk with TT genotype in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>; OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.17-1.88) and a 1.8-fold decreased risk in Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with TT genotype (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.10-2.87) than CC genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The chemotherapy response was analysed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and ALL/Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> because these patients received standard chemotherapy protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was detected between responder and non-responders according to MTHFR T677C polymorphism, but the patients who had TT genotype respond 1.75-fold worse than CC (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.07-4.64) in ALL patients (p=0.59), and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, CT genotype revealed a 1.8-fold worse response than CC genotype (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.17-1.7), but TT genotype revealed 2.6-fold better response rates than patients with CC genotype (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 0.26-26.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a conclusion, MTHFR C677T polymorphism does not increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e>, and it does not have an effect on chemotherapy response significantly; however, the patients with TT genotype have a slightly increased risk for ALL, and they also respond worse than CC genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TT genotype slightly decreases the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, and the patients have much favorable response rates </plain></SENT>
