<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The conjugate consisting mainly of one molecule of protein A bound to two molecules of A chains (Mr 107,000) was purified by tandem affinity chromatography on ConA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> 4B and IgG-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> 4B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purified protein A-A chain conjugate was able to bind and kill human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells coated either with monoclonal mouse IgG2a anti-kappa antibody or with polyclonal rabbit anti-kappa antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic activity of protein A-A chain conjugate in conjunction with either mouse or rabbit anti-kappa antibodies was 10 times higher than that of rabbit IgG anti-mouse IgG coupled with A chain on Daudi cells coated with mouse anti-kappa antibody and 100 times higher than that of rabbit anti-kappa antibody coupled with A chain on non-coated Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic effect of protein A-A chain conjugate on antibody-coated Daudi cells (9 x 10(-12) M) was comparable with that of ricin toxin on non-coated Daudi cells (2 x 10(-12) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results recommend the use of protein A-ricin A chain toxin conjugate as a unique specific toxin for the "in vitro" killing of antibody-coated target cells </plain></SENT>
