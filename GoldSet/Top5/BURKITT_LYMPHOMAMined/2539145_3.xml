<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of kinase effectors allowed to detect some of the kinases involved in these phosphorylations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pp60src-like phosphotyrosine kinase and protein kinase C were involved in the phosphorylation of plasma membrane or nuclear EBV/C3dR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An additional calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase was also involved in nuclear EBV/C3dR phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>P120 RNP phosphorylation was under the control of protein kinase C and of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3312">CaCl2</z:chebi>/Calmodulin-dependent kinase but also of casein kinase II </plain></SENT>
