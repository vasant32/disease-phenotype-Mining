<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Various forms of inorganic <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi> are significant environmental contaminants that have multiple effects on cells, including the induction of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in lymphoid cells can mediate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immunotoxicity</z:e> following exposure to chemicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms regulating the sensitivity of B-lymphocytes to <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> are not understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the involvement of key <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase pathways and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29678">sodium arsenite</z:chebi> in a model system of chemically resistant and susceptible B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies revealed a differential requirement for the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29678">sodium arsenite</z:chebi> in the resistant EW36 versus sensitive ST486 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, activation of the JNK pathway was not required for arsenite-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in ST486 cells, whereas JNK pathway activation was always associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction in EW36 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we found that EW36 cells, which overexpress the Bcl-2 protein, can be substantially sensitized to arsenite-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by prior exposure to nonlethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, pretreatment with an inhibitor of p38 kinase acted synergistically with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> to further sensitize EW36 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of p38 prolonged a transient period of JNK phosphorylation that occurred immediately after heat shock treatment and involved the persistent activation of SEK1, one of the kinases upstream of JNK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly, the sensitization of resistant cells is characterized by a lowering of the threshold concentration of arsenite required to activate the JNK pathway and induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
