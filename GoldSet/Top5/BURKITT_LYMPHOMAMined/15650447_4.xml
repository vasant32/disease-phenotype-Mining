<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Anti-HLA-DR and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been effective for immunotherapy and radioimmunotherapy in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to compare the antilymphoma effects of Lym-1 and rituximab in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, using assays of viability, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), under conditions relevant to the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To characterize response relationships at varied concentrations of Lym-1 and rituximab, growth inhibition and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were assayed over 96 hours in four NHL cell lines derived from Burkitt's or large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Untreated cells and cells treated with an mLym-1 isotype-matched MAb were used as negative controls for direct assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot was used to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through the activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-ribase) polymerase (PARP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The indirect cytotoxicity of Lym-1 and rituximab was assayed at varied concentrations, using ADCC activity in the presence of purified peripheral blood leukocytes and CDC activity in the presence of human donor serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lym-1 and rituximab showed significant direct and indirect antilymphoma effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lym-1 had a substantial, and statistically greater, effect than rituximab over longer intervals of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Raji and B35M cells, Lym-1 induced potent growth inhibition reflected by 90% and 94% reductions in viable cells, respectively, whereas rituximab induced 63% and 56% reductions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concurrently, Lym-1 increased nonviable cells by 372% and 153% in these cells, respectively, whereas rituximab induced 139% and 43% increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lym-1-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was greater than that of rituximab in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lym-1, both the chimeric form and the mouse parent, mediate ADCC more effectively, in the presence of a total peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) population, than does rituximab, although the results for CDC activity were mixed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, Lym-1 had more potent direct and indirect cytotoxic effects than rituximab in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells under conditions achievable in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because the HLA-DR target antigen of Lym-1 is enriched on most B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, these results support its complementary use in patients as an alternative to CD20 for monoimmunotherapy and for combination immunotherapy with rituximab, because the HLA-DR and CD20 antigens are physically and functionally coupled on human B cells </plain></SENT>
