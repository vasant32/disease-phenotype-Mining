<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The direct measurement of drug suspensions on blood cell counters has been performed in an in vitro study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an ex vivo study, the haematological parameters were compared before and during Abelcet infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant interference effect was observed in platelet counts, together with minimal differences in the WBC, RBC, and Hb parameters in the in vitro study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the ex vivo study, there were statistically significant deviations only in RBC counts and in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) level, while there was no difference in the other parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is been reported that the drug accumulates very rapidly in the reticuloendothelial system and circulates minimally in the plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>That is why there is a significant deviation in the direct counting of platelets, while the platelet counts taken from the patients do not differ statistically </plain></SENT>
