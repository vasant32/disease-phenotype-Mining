<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A constitutional translocation t(3;8)(p14.2;q24.1) segregates concordantly with a familial form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This translocation moves the MYC oncogene, located at 8q24.1, onto the short arm of chromosome 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosome rearrangements that break in or near MYC can result in altered expression of this gene and are thought to be a primary change leading to the transformed phenotype in certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic diseases</z:e>, particularly Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Possible rearrangements of this gene in familial <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> have so far not been detected using standard Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used pulsed field gel (PFG) analysis to construct a restriction map that covers a 1500-kb region surrounding MYC, including over 1000 kb to the 5' and 550 kb to the 3' side of this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5' end of MYC contains a cluster of cleavage sites for rare-cutting restriction endonucleases, indicating the presence of an HTF island </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PFG analysis of DNA containing the t(3;8) rearrangement shows that the breakpoint is not located in the mapped region, making it unlikely that MYC is involved in this form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The map should facilitate study of other chromosome 8 rearrangements thought to break near MYC </plain></SENT>
