<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) shows its antitumor effect through binding to specific cell surface receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A DNA synthesis inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> (HU), has been successfully combined with IFN-alpha to improve the efficiency of IFN therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand the mechanism of this combination effect, expression of IFN-alpha receptors on the <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> cell line, K562, was studied before and after treatment with HU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cells were treated with HU at a dose of 0, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mmol/L for 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Binding assays were performed using 125I-labeled IFN-alpha at 4 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle analysis was carried out using flow cytometer following staining cellular DNA with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis was performed to evaluate the inducibility of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene expression by IFN-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">Hydroxyurea</z:chebi>-treated cells showed a dose- and time-dependent increase in binding of 125I-labeled IFN-alpha (maximal 2.5-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increase of binding was caused by an increase in the number of binding sites with a constant receptor affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle analyses suggested that upregulation of the IFN receptor may have occurred as a result of the alteration in the cell cycle distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IFN-alpha induction of the IFN-inducible gene IRF-1 mRNA in HU-treated K562 cells was 2-fold higher than that in untreated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thus, HU may have an ability to enhance the response to IFN-alpha probably because of its ability to upregulate the IFN-alpha receptors, suggesting that this may be involved in the mechanism of effective combination therapy of IFN-alpha with HU </plain></SENT>
