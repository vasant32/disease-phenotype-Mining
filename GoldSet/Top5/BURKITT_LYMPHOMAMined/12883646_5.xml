<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to examine this hypothesis further, we fractionated Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells into their cytosolic and nuclear components and examined for expression of the endogenous proform and active large subunit of caspase-3; procaspase-3 and its active p17 large subunit were identified in both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions of Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence staining together with ordinary and confocal microscopy confirmed the observations that procaspase-3 immunoreactivity was clearly identified in the cytoplasm and nucleus while Fas ligand staining was localized to the cell surface and PARP immunoactivity to the nucleus, which were used as controls; procaspase-3 exhibited granular nuclear immunoreactivity whereas PARP displayed diffuse nuclear immunoreactivity; both of which was more intense in the internucleolar regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we now present evidence that procaspases and their active large subunits are found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and that procaspases localized not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus are activated following application of apoptotic stimulus in Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells </plain></SENT>
