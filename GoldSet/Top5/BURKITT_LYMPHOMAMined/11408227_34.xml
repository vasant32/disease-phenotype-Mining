<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show that treatment of an EBV(+) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> led to a dose-dependent induction of EBV lytic antigen expression, including expression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase (TK) and phosphotransferase (PT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Azacytidine treatment for 24 h modestly sensitized the cell line to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleosides</z:chebi> tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To better characterize EBV TK with regard to various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> analogues, we expressed EBV TK in stable cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two EBV TK-expressing clones were moderately sensitive to high doses of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> and penciclovir (PCV) (62.5 to 500 microM) and to lower doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> (GCV) and bromovinyldeoxyuridine (BVdU) (10 to 100 microM) compared to a control clone and were shown to phosphorylate GCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar experiments in a transient overexpression system showed more killing of cells transfected with the EBV TK expression vector than of cells transfected with the control mutant vector (50 microM GCV for 4 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A putative PT was also studied in the transient transfection system and appeared similar to the TK in phosphorylating GCV and conferring sensitivity to GCV, but not in BVdU- or PCV-mediated cell killing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Induction of EBV kinases in combination with agents such as GCV merits further evaluation as an alternative strategy to gene therapy for selective killing of EBV-infected cells </plain></SENT>
