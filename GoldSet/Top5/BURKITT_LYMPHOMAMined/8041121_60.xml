<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been found to be associated with a type of gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (EBVaGC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, many questions remain unanswered, such as epidemiology, and pathologic features of EBVaGC and the significance of EBV in the genesis of EBVaGC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and non-neoplastic mucosa were evaluated to reveal the following issues: the incidence of EBVaGC in Japanese population, pathologic features and EBV genotype, clonality, and gene-expression in EBVaGC, localization of EBV in non-neoplastic stomach, and serum titer of anti-EBV antibodies in EBVaGC-carrying patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using PCR and EBER1 in situ hybridization, EBVaGC (definitely amplifiable EBV-DNA and positive EBER1-signal in the nuclei of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells) was found in 8 of 72 gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dominant genotype of EBV was type A (7/8), with type C (6/8), and F (8/8) restriction enzyme polymorphism, which are the predominant type of EBV found in throat washing of the general population in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBVaGC was found in the cardia (4/8) or body (4/8) of the stomach, and consisted of 7 advanced and 1 intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By Southern blot analysis of EBVaGC hybridized with right- and left-side probe adjacent to the terminal repeats, EBV was present in a monoclonal episomal form in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the EBVaGC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBVaGC lacked expression of EBNA2 (0/8) and LMP1 (0/8) by immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In non-neoplastic mucosa, EBER1 signal was identified in the infiltrating lymphocytes and shedding epithelial cells predominantly in fundic gland mucosa of patients with EBVaGC (8/8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with EBVaGC showed high titers of anti-VCA IgG (8/8), anti-VCA IgA (2/8) and anti-EA IgG (7/8) antibodies just before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EBV may infect the surface epithelium of the stomach through the reactivated EBV-carrying lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EBV may be a factor initiating EBVaGC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anti-EBV antibodies or EBER1 in situ hybridization may help to identify patients at high risk for EBVaGC </plain></SENT>
