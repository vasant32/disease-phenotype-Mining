<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antibody panel included 10 previously characterized monoclonals to antigens of known structure: HLA-A,B,C; Ia; and actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, a commercial reagent was shown to react with HLA chains in immunoblots, and not to cross-react with actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Target cells known to have strong, weak, or negative expression of the antigens were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the results were in complete accord with the established properties of the antibodies, antigens, and target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For example, HLA bands were detected in lymphoid cells with strong HLA-A,B,C expression, and also in a neuronal cell line with 0.5% of the lymphoid activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytoskeletal cross-reactions, or other unexpected specific bands, were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This work lays a foundation for interpreting immunoblot analyses of monoclonal antibodies to newly defined proteins of complex tissue </plain></SENT>
