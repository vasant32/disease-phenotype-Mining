<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Murine B cells have a restricted uptake capacity for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17376">cystine</z:chebi> and require cysteine for proliferation, which can be supplied efficiently by feeder cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have studied the role of cysteine and other compounds with free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29917">thiol groups</z:chebi> for survival and proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This toxicity could be counteracted by the addition of catalase, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> or bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which interfere with the production of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
