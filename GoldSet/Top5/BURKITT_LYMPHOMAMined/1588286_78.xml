<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, we showed that an 88-kD protein (p88) associates rapidly and quantitatively with newly synthesized murine major histocompatibility complex class I molecules within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This interaction is transient and dissociation of p88 appears to be rate limiting for transport of class I molecules from the ER to the Golgi apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we examine the relationship between p88 interaction and assembly of the ternary complex of class I heavy chain beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m), and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both murine and human beta 2m-deficient cells, in which little or no transport of class I heavy chains is observed, p88 remained associated with intracellular heavy chains throughout their lifetime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In murine RMA-S cells, which are apparently defective in accumulating <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ligands for class I within the ER, prolonged association of p88 with "empty" heavy chain-beta 2m heterodimers was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, p88 dissociated slowly in parallel with the slow rate of ER to Golgi transport of empty class I molecules in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The close correlation between p88 association and impaired class I transport suggests that p88 functions to retain incompletely assembled class I molecules in the ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that conformational changes in class I heavy chains induced by the binding of both beta 2m and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> are required for efficient p88 dissociation and subsequent class I transport </plain></SENT>
