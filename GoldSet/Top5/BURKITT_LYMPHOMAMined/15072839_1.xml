<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 1 microg ml(-1) concentration, almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 2-styrylquinazolinones showed some cytotoxic activity against the L1210 and K562 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, only 6-chloro-2-styryl-3-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidin</z:chebi>-2yl)-4(3H)-quinazolinone inhibited the growth of these cells by over 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This last compound was also the only member of the series that inhibited tubulin polymerization, with an IC(50) value of 5.8 versus 3.2 microM for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was also examined for effects on the growth of human MCF7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> cells and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> CA46 cells, which had IC(50) values of 0.34 and 1.0 microM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 10 microM 6-chloro-2-styryl-3-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidin</z:chebi>-2yl)-4(3H)-quinazolinone induced G2/M arrest (66%) in Burkitt cells, with a mitotic index of 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 3.4 microM, it caused disruption of the cellular microtubule system of the MCF7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both these cellular effects are consistent with its mechanism of action resulting from its inhibitory effect on tubulin assembly </plain></SENT>
