<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> protein (PML) nuclear bodies or nuclear domain 10s (ND10s) are multiprotein nuclear structures implicated in transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene regulation that are disrupted during replication of many DNA viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interferon increases the size and number of PML nuclear bodies and stimulates transcription of several genes encoding PML nuclear body proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, some PML nuclear body proteins colocalize at sites of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA synthesis and transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the relationship between lytic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) replication and Sp110b, a PML nuclear body protein, was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sp110b is shown to physically and functionally interact with the EBV protein SM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SM is expressed early in the EBV replicative cycle and posttranscriptionally increases the level of target EBV lytic transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SM bound to Sp110b via two distinct sites in Sp110b in an <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-independent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SM also specifically induced expression of Sp110b during lytic EBV replication and in several cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exogenous expression of Sp110b synergistically enhanced SM-mediated accumulation of intronless and lytic <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This synergistic effect was shown to be promoter independent, posttranscriptional, and the result of increased stabilization of target transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, inhibiting Sp110b expression decreased accumulation of an SM-responsive lytic EBV transcript in EBV-infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings imply that SM induces Sp110b expression, binds to Sp110b, and utilizes the recruited Sp110b protein to increase the stability of lytic EBV transcripts, indicating that Sp110b is a component of the cellular machinery that EBV utilizes to enhance lytic EBV replication </plain></SENT>
