<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety percent of cases had at least one mutation or genetic alteration, most commonly involving MYC and TP53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBV(-) cases were more likely than EBV(+) cases to have multiple mutations (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alterations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-related genes not previously described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Truncating mutations in ARID1A, a member of the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex, were seen in 17% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MCL1 pathway alterations were found in 22% of cases and confirmed in an expanded panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other clinically relevant genomic alterations were found in 20% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest the roles of MCL1 and ARID1A in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> pathogenesis and demonstrate that comprehensive genomic profiling may identify additional treatment options in refractory disease </plain></SENT>
