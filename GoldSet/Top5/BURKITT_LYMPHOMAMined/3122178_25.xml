<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1) by chromosomal walking is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hybridization experiments with the DNA of a somatic cell hybrid containing the region between JKCK and the telomer show that none of the major VK gene clusters is located downstream of CK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distance between the VK and JK genes was found to be 23 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The JK proximal VK gene is the B3 gene which is the only representative of subgroup IV in the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This gene and the neighbouring B2 gene (accompanying paper) are arranged in opposite orientation to JKCK and can therefore rearrange only by an inversion mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding is used, together with previous data, to delineate the rearrangement processes in the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> derived cell line BL21 as comprising an inversion in the first and a deletion in the second step </plain></SENT>
