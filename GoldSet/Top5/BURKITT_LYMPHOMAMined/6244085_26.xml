<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical stage and anti-EA titer were the best predictive factors, but lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> (UA) concentrations also correlated with stage and prognosis, whereas <z:chebi fb="22" ids="28358">lactic acid</z:chebi> (LA), which was significantly elevated in Stage D, did not significantly correlated with prognosis or with LDH and UA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these factors with the possible exception of LA reflect the total body burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden is the single most important prognostic factor in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and that this is reflected directly by LDH and UA concentrations, and probably indirectly by anti-EA titer </plain></SENT>
