<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we present a novel strategy for identifying proteins that are altered in their expression levels in a diseased cell using cell specific aptamers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using an intact viable B-cell Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Ramos cells) as the target, we have selected aptamers that recognize cell membrane proteins with high affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the selected aptamers that showed different recognition patterns with different cell lines of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, the aptamer TD05 showed binding with Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By chemically modifying TD05 to covalently cross-link with its target on Ramos cells to capture and to enrich the target receptors using streptavidin coated magnetic beads followed by mass spectrometry, we were able to identify membrane bound immunoglobin heavy mu chain as the target for TD05 aptamer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobin heavy mu chain is a major component of the B-cell antigen receptor, which is expressed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that this two step strategy, the development of high quality aptamer probes and then the identification of their target proteins, can be used to discover new disease related potential markers and thus enhance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diagnosis and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aptamer based strategy will enable effective molecular elucidation of disease related biomarkers and other interesting molecules </plain></SENT>
