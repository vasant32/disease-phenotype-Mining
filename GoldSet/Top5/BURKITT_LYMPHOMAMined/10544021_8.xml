<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether and how the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 can be activated by anticancer drug treatment in the presence of excess MDM2 is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we showed that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitor</z:chebi> of widely used anticancer drugs <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> activated wt p53 in BL2, a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line which overexpressed MDM2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activation of p53 was followed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in BL2 cells, while the same drug treatment did not induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Raji cells, another Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line which carried mutant p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activation of p53 was accompanied by phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 and elevated p21 and MDM2, both of which were at least partly blocked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi>, a kinase inhibitor against proteins with a PI3 kinase domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although MDM2 protein was rapidly cleaved and degraded after anticancer drug treatment, cotreatment with caspase inhibitor Z-VAD blocked degradation, while wt p53 remained activated, suggesting MDM2 degradation not to be essential for the activation of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> stabilized p53 without being further phosphorylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This p53 was co-immunoprecipitated with MDM2, but p53 activated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> barely complexed with MDM2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 in MDM2-overexpressing cells can be activated by anticancer drugs through phosphorylation of p53, alleviating inhibitory action by MDM2, and activating caspases which in turn downregulates MDM2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The activation of p53 in MDM2-overexpressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, which does not require the downregulation of MDM2, may have important implications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
