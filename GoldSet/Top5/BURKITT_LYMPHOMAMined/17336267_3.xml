<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dynamic relationship between Gb(3)/CD77 and key B-cell membrane proteins was studied in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with a focus on CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Engagement of Gb(3)/CD77 with SLT-B reduced the amount of CD20 and CXCR4 available, but levels of BCR, MHC Class II, CD21, CD27 and CD54 remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> promoted a decrease in the number of sites accessed by CD20, CXCR4 and Gb(3)/CD77 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Constitutive localisation of Gb(3)/CD77 to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts was unperturbed by either SLT-B binding or cholesterol <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, whereas the opposite was true for CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects were specific to SLT-B, highlighted by the inability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cholera</z:e> toxin B-subunit to alter CD20 availability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the binding of Gb(3)/CD77 by its cognate ligand transmits information within the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> bilayer of model <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to impact the behaviour of selective proteins, most notably CD20, via a mechanism influenced by the level of cholesterol within the membrane </plain></SENT>
