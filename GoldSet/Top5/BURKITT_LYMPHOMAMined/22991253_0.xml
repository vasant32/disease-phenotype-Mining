<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV reactivates during spaceflight, with EBV shedding in saliva increasing to levels ten times those observed pre-and post-flight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although stress has been shown to increase reactivation of EBV, other factors such as radiation and microgravity have been hypothesized to contribute to reactivation in space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a modeled spaceflight environment to evaluate the influence of radiation and microgravity on EBV reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BJAB (EBV-negative) and Raji (EBV-positive) cell lines were assessed for viability/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigen and reactive oxygen species expression, and DNA damage and repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBV-infected cells did not experience decreased viability and <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> due to modeled spaceflight, whereas an EBV-negative cell line did, suggesting that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> provided protection against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiation was the major contributor to EBV ZEBRA upregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combining modeled microgravity and radiation increased DNA damage and reactive oxygen species while modeled microgravity alone decreased DNA repair in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, EBV-infected cells had increased DNA damage compared to EBV-negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since EBV-infected cells do not undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as readily as uninfected cells, it is possible that virus-infected cells in EBV seropositive individuals may have an increased risk to accumulate DNA damage during spaceflight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More studies are warranted to investigate this possibility </plain></SENT>
