<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The biochemical nature of this Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated antigen was investigated by staining inhibition assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indirect immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis show that antibody 38.13 reacts with a protease-resistant structure present among the hydrophobic components extracted with <z:chebi fb="59" ids="35255">chloroform</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi> from the Ramos Burkitt's cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These components were further separated by ion-exchange chromatography and activity resides in the unbound (neutral) fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The staining antibody is specifically absorbed when preincubated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4139">D-galactose</z:chebi>, and to a lesser extent with N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28328">galactosamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 38.13 appears to recognize a determinant of carbohydrate nature, which is carried on a neutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
