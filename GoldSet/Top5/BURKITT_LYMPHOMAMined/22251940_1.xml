<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated SOX11 expression pattern in B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) subtypes to confirm specificity and used it as a feature to identify the first reported cases of cyclin D1-negative blastoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SOX11 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 140 cases of mature B-NHL, including 4 cases of suspected blastoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> that lacked cyclin D1 expression and 8 cases of CD5-positive diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, 5 cases of B or T lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear expression of SOX11 was found in cyclin D1-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (30/30, 100%) and in a case of cyclin D1-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> with typical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SOX11 was also expressed in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1/5, 20%) and lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (2/3 T-LBLs, 2/2 B-LBLs, overall 4/5, 80%), whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of DLBL (including CD5 DLBL) and other small B-NHL were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 4 suspected cases of blastoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> were also SOX11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cases had a complex karyotype that included 12p abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We confirmed prior reports that stated that SOX11 nuclear expression was a specific marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, including cyclin D1-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> with typical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding its use in identifying cases of cyclin D1-negative blastoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Routine use of SOX11 in cases of suspected CD5 DLBL might help identify additional cases of cyclin D1-negative blastoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
