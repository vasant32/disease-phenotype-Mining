<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize distribution and appearance of abdominal <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> detected with spiral computed tomography (CT) examination in patients with solid organ transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 1994 and April 2006, 198 patients underwent liver transplantation and 568 patients underwent renal transplantation in our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The abdominal CT studies were reviewed to determine the presence or absence of abdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> abdominal CT examinations were performed prior to immunomodulation or chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven renal and one liver transplantation patient developed an abdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 11 renal transplantation patients eight were diagnosed as abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo> (KS) and three as posttransplantation <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (PTLD) upon spiral CT examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two patients the transplanted organ itself had <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp>: one patient had PTLD with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the transplanted liver and the other a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> in the transplanted kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abdominal PTLD and KS showed imaging findings and the site of organ involvement somewhat different from nontransplant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common pathologies in KS were liver lesions (n=6) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>But in abdominal PTLD, the spleen (n=3) was the most involved organ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The early diagnosis of abdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> after solid organ transplantation is crucial for the patient's prognosis, especially under immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The abdominal spiral CT examination was an effective modality to depict a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> among patients with solid organ transplantation </plain></SENT>
