<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transition of cells from quiescence to proliferation requires an increase in the rate of protein synthesis, which is regulated in part by two key translation initiation factors, 4E and 2alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression and activity of both factors are increased transiently when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> resting cells are stimulated to proliferate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They are constitutively elevated in oncogene transformed cultured cells, and overexpression of either initiation factor in rodent cells makes them tumorigenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigate an association between the expression of translation initiation factors and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the expression of the protein synthesis initiation factors 4E and 2alpha by immunohistochemistry in reactive lymph nodes and several types of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> representing a wide range of clinical behaviors based on the Revised European-American <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> behavioral classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study included 7 benign lymph nodes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, 26 indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (6 marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 7 small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 13 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, grades 1 and 2), 16 moderately aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (8 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 8 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, grade 3), 24 aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (14 large-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 10 anaplastic large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>), and 15 highly aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (7 lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 8 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strong expression of initiation factors 4E and 2alpha was demonstrated in the germinal centers of reactive follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Minimal or no expression was seen in the mantle zones and surrounding paracortices, indicating that high expression of initiation factors 4E and 2alpha is associated with the active proliferation of lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most cases of aggressive and highly aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed strong expression of initiation factors 4E and 2alpha, in contrast to the cases of indolent and moderately aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in which their expression was intermediate between the germinal centers and the mantles of reactive follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was found between the expression of both initiation factors 4E and 2alpha and the Revised European-American <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> behavior classification (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, constitutively increased expression of initiation factors 4E and 2alpha may play an important role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and is correlated with their biological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
