<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considerable variation exists in the literature with respect to incidence of the various histological subtypes and sites of involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to ascertain the anatomic distribution, histological subtypes and sites of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> GIT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> presenting to a tertiary referral hospital in southern India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The histological material of 361 patients over a period of 10 years (2001-2010), with histopathological diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involving the GIT (both primary and secondary), was analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were reclassified according to the World Health Organization 2008 classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: These 361 cases include 336 primary and 25 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, where the involvement was secondary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> consisted of 267 males (79.64%) and 68 females (20.24%) with a male:female ratio of 3.93:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 45 years (range 3-88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) was the commonest subtype (222 cases; 66.71%), followed by low-grade marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type (34 cases; 10.12%) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (35 cases; 10.48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The commonest site was stomach (180 cases; 53.57%), followed by small intestine (79 cases; 23.51%) and large intestine (68 cases; 20.23%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were some uncommon types of GIT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> documented during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this largest retrospective single centre study from India, we establish that the pattern of distribution of primary GIT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PGLs</z:e>) in India is similar to the western literature in that the stomach is the commonest site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PGL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> is the commonest histological subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021071" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="IPSID">Immunoproliferative small intestinal disease</z:e> cases were seen in this study, which is uncommon in the west </plain></SENT>
