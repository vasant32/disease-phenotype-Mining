<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We attempted to determine whether or not Yersinia enterocolitica could invade two cell lines derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), P3HR-1, and Raji cells, and if the expression of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome could be activated by the invasion of the organisms into the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The invasiveness of Y. enterocolitica into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells was examined morphologically, using transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and the induction of EBV antigens in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells was examined by indirect immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Y. enterocolitica was clearly observed to invade P3HR-1 and Raji cells within 2 hr incubation at 37 degrees, after <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the invaded <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells did not show significant induction of EBV early antigen after cultivation for 72 hr at 37 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the present experiment failed to yield positive findings pertaining to the activation of EBV genome, our experimental system per se may still be a useful model when attempting to assess the effects of invading bacteria on the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome persistently carried in the host cells </plain></SENT>
