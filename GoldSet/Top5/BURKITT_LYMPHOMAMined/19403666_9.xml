<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> induces RUNX3, the consequent reduction in RUNX1 levels is required for the ensuing cell proliferation because forced expression of RUNX1 in an EBV lymphoblastoid cell line prevented cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-RUNX1 fusion gene from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> B-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> retains almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the RUNX1 sequence but does not prevent B-cell proliferation in the same assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) was found to be induced by conditionally expressed RUNX3 in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that RUNX3 binds to the RUNX1 promoter in a lymphoblastoid cell line and a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TLE binding VWRPY sequence from the C terminus of RUNX3 was found to be required for repression of the RUNX1 P1 promoter in a B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of repression in B-cell lines most likely involves recruitment of corepressor TLE3 or TLE4 to the RUNX1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate the importance of RUNX3-mediated repression of RUNX1 for EBV-driven B-cell proliferation and identify functional differences between human RUNX family proteins </plain></SENT>
