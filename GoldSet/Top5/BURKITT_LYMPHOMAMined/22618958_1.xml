<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) is endemic in parts of Tanzania, but there is scant country or region level data about burden and trends of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in Tanzania over the past three decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we update baseline epidemiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in northern Tanzania using recent data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: Data for childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> diagnosed at six hospitals in Mara and Mwanza regions in northern Tanzania during 2000-2009 were compiled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, and regional patterns were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Crude incidence rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were calculated by sex, anatomic site, geographical region, and calendar year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 944 cases, 549 (58%) were male (male/female case ratio 1.4:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among those with known anatomic site (92%), facial only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> represented a large proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in boys than girls (50% vs. 36%, P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> occurred at a younger mean age in boys than girls (6.8 years vs. 7.6 years, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Crude <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> incidence was 4.2 per 100,000, but varied by region (3.0 in Mwanza vs. 6.8 in Mara, P = 0.01), by district (1.4-22), by gender (5.0 in boys vs. 4.0 in girls), and by age group (2.0 in 0-4, 7.8 in 5-9, and 3.1 in 10-15 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> incidence peaked in 2001 and decreased gradually thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that male sex, young age, and geographical characteristics are risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in Tanzania </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> incidence declined with calendar year, but the significance of this finding is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Well-designed epidemiological studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in Tanzania may shed light on environmental characteristics underlying these patterns </plain></SENT>
