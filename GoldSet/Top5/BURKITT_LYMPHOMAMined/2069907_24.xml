<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed molecular cloning and sequencing of the breakpoints of a new chromosomal translocation involving the MYC protooncogene locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This secondary t(8;12)(q24;q22) was associated with a primary t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation in a case of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) in blastic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, Northern blot and nuclease analyses SI showed that MYC was strongly expressed with initiation of the transcription at both the 5' and 3' promoters as observed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; no coding change was observed in MYC putative regulatory sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint on chromosome 8 mapped to the 3' end of the MYC locus, in a region containing a potential Z-DNA tract, and where we identified two DNase 1 hypersensitive sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A rearranged MYC gene fragment was cloned and shown to contain chromosome 12 information by Southern blot analysis and by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A genomic probe subcloned from the isolated region of the chromosome 12 recognized a 1.8 kb transcript in virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the tissues tested but a preferential expression of this new gene, which we termed BTG1 (for B-cell translocation gene 1) was observed in the CLL cells and in tissues of lymphoid origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This chromosome 12 coding sequence is conserved in evolution and a transcript of similar size is present in murine tissues </plain></SENT>
