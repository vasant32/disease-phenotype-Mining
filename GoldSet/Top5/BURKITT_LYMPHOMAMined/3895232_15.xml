<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A higher proportion of effector-target conjugates was observed in the presence of human serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In similar experiments lysis of 1301, Rael, and P3HR-1 cells was unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines activated the alternative pathway of complement but they varied in the expression of receptors for complement component 3 (C3) and in the ability to fix the C3 cleavage products on their membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enhancement of lysis in the presence of human serum occurred only with those cells that bound C3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This characteristic was correlated to the expression of C3 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the nature of the deposited C3 was performed with Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Raji cells exposed to human serum bound C3b as indicated by the immunoadherence test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The C3b was further processed to C3bi, because the immunoadherence declined with time and conjugate formation increased with Daudi cells, which carry the C3 receptors CR2 and CR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that in the lytic assay lymphocytes with C3bi receptors are recruited in the presence of human serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We assume that the bridge of C3 molecules between targets and effectors increases the avidity of their interaction </plain></SENT>
