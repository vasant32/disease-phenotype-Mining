<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A patient is described who presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) and later developed a lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells from the CLL were typical mature B lymphocytes as could be assessed by morphologic, cytochemical, and surface marker analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells from the lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were immature B cells that expressed CD10, CD20, and HLA-DR markers, but not surface Ig or cytoplasmic mu chains, and were negative for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells of two continuous cell lines, obtained from the bone marrow and the peripheral blood of the patient, had the same phenotype as the lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, did not contain the Epstein-Barr virus genome, and displayed malignant features in vitro, including the capacity to form colonies in agar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two cell lines also shared identical chromosomal abnormalities, a finding which suggests that they derived from the same malignant cell already present in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such chromosomal abnormalities were not seen in the karyotype of the peripheral blood cells at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the Ig heavy chain genes using a DJ-specific probe showed the very same monoclonal rearrangement in the cells from the B-CLL, the lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the two cell lines, thus demonstrating their common clonal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, a monoclonal rearrangement of the lambda chain gene locus was found in the B-CLL cells only, a finding consistent with their exclusive capacity to express surface IgM lambda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This patient represents a rare case in whom a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> with mature malignant cells transforms into a lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> characterized by cells frozen at a very early maturational stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The possible mechanisms leading to such transformation within the same cell clone are discussed </plain></SENT>
