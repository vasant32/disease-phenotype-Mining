<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) a small number of "latent" proteins are expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These are the EBV nuclear antigens, EBNAs 1-6, and a latent membrane protein, LMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the expression of these proteins in a variety of EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whereas transplant and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from cotton-top tamarins appear to express the full range of antigens found in LCLs, we and others have found that in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and a nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) isolate, EBNA expression is restricted to EBNA-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(In NPC, but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, LMP may also be expressed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to ask what restricts the expression of EBNA 2-6 in NPC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells it seemed reasonable to consider the possibility that the DNA sequences normally regulating expression of these antigens could be chemically modified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, a tight inverse correlation between methylation of CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> in the 5' flanking region of the EBNA-2 gene and the expression of EBNAs 2-6 has been revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the NPC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, CpG methylation within the gene is also observed, as is specific methylation over the EBNA-I region I and II binding sites (in oriP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The significance of these observations is considered </plain></SENT>
