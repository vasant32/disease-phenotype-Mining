<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The B23 clone contained a 1.3 kb cDNA insert encoding a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> of 294 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 32,539 daltons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deduced B23 amino acid sequence contained 2 acidic domains rich in aspartic and glutamic acid, a feature shared by a number of nuclear and nucleolar proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The human B23 amino acid sequence showed 98% homology with rat B23 and 68% homology with the Xenopus laevis nucleolar phosphoprotein, NO38 showing that the primary structure of B23 is highly conserved among these species </plain></SENT>
