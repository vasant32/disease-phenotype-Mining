<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) from north-western Iran were investigated for the usage and somatic mutational pattern of their immunoglobulin variable region genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Potentially functional V(H) genes were amplified from 6/12 of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> masses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these were derived from the V(H)3 family, with 4/6 being derived from the most commonly used V(H)3 family member, V3-23 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraclonal sequence <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was also evident in 4/6 of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, showing that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells had undergone further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the five potentially functional mutated V(H) sequences showed a significant clustering of replacement mutations in the complementarity-determining region 2, consistent with a role for antigen in selection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pattern of extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo>, and intraclonal variation, in these mainly EBV+ve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, was similar to that previously reported in V(H) sequences of EBV+ve endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (eBL) and EBV-ve <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (sBL), with the mean level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> lying between those reported for eBL (7.7%) and sBL (4.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, VH gene bias and the distribution of mutations in the Iranian cases showed features which differed from those reported for endemic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
