<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the hybrid cells, D98/Raji and D98/HR-1, with IUDR induced the formation of EA and VCA and replication of virus DNA, whereas the same treatment of Raji cells induced only the formation of EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patterns of transcription of virus genomes in these three cell lines were, however, very similar: 25% without treatment with IUDR, 30% immediately after the treatment and 50% (entire genome transcription) three days after being transferred to fresh medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amount of virus <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in the cells, calculated from DNA-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> hybridization kinetics, was proportional to the number of virus genomes per cell, suggesting that every copy of virus DNA in these cells is actively transcribed </plain></SENT>
