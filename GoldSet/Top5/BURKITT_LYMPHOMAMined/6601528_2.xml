<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood lymphocytes were preactivated by coculturing with either fetal calf serum or with allogeneic continuous B-cell lines (LCCL) which were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These supernatants contained a population of L-929 cell-lytic LT forms which also selectively bind to the NK-sensitive K-562 cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, lytic LT forms for L-929 cells from cPBL and LCCL cultures did not bind to the NK-sensitive MOLT-4 or NK-resistant Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional studies reveal these supernatants contain a second set of LT forms which have cell-binding and cell-lytic activity detectable on MOLT-4 and K-562 cells in a 12 to 18 hr <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-release assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell-lytic form(s) for the MOLT-4 and K-562 cells were not stable for more than a week at -20 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that materials with LT activity are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> with respect to their capacity to recognize common and discrete cell-surface components on different types of target cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
