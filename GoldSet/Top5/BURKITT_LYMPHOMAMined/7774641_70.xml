<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endogenous antigen-processing function is restored in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines that have undergone Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced drift in culture to the group III phenotype typically displayed by EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared group I versus group III cells for their expression of proteasome components, transporter proteins and HLA-class I antigens, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which are thought to be involved in the endogenous antigen processing pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By Western blot analysis, there were not consistent differences in the low molecular mass protein subunits of proteasomes (lmp)-2, lmp-7 and delta, although the mb-1 proteasome subunit was regularly present at higher levels in group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines relative to group III lines or LCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast there were marked differences in the expression of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> transporter-associated proteins (Tap), with down-regulation of Tap-1 and Tap-2 in 8/8 and 7/8 group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surface levels of HLA class I antigens were also consistently lower in group I cells; this was not associated with an intracellular accumulation of free HLA heavy chains, such as is seen in the Tap-deficient T2 processing-mutant line, but instead reflected a reduced rate of HLA class I synthesis in group I cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of EBV gene transfectants of the B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines BJAB and BL41 showed that the virus-encoded latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1), which is one of several EBV antigens expressed in group III but not in group I cells, was uniquely able to up-regulate expression both of the Tap proteins and HLA class I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this was accompanied by a restoration of antigen-processing function as measured by the ability of these cells to present an endogenously expressed <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigen to CTL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These effects of LMP1 were similar to those induced in the same cell lines by interferon-gamma treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results implicate both Tap and HLA class I expression as factors limiting the antigen-processing function of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, and suggest that the accessibility of other EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> to CTL surveillance may be critically dependent upon their LMP1 status </plain></SENT>
