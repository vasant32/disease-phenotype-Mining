<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sera from a small sample of adult blood donors, healthy school children and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, non-haematologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, congenital and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> from Ibadan, Nigeria were screened for HTLV-I antibody by an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay and confirmed by investigational Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine of 236 positively screened samples could not be tested for confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seropositive reactivity was observed in nine of 123 blood donors, and 3 of 46 healthy school children but banding patterns on Western blot were often sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among non-Burkitt's non Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients six of 30 were HTLV-I positive including four of four with clinical features of adult T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ATL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other clinical conditions had a frequency of positivity indistinguishable from healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot patterns ranged from strong with multiple bands, which were uncommon, to those with only p24 and p21 envelope positive which were frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given the relative paucity of clinical ATL and the unusual Western blot patterns the true rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HTLV-I infection</z:e> may be lower than estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is possible that a cross-reactive HTLV-I-like virus accounts for this pattern </plain></SENT>
