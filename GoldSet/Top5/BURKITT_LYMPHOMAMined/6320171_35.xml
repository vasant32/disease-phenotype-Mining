<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new antigenic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> was identified in mouse L cells and in monkey COS-1 cells in which Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) was expressed as the result of gene transfer with cloned fragments of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The same-size protein (Mr, approximately equal to 78,000) was seen in stably transformed mouse cells harboring only the BamHI K fragment [approximately equal to 5.2 kilobase pairs (kbp)] or its BamHI/HindIII subfragment, I1f (approximately equal to 2.9 kbp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the latter DNA fragment is sufficient to code for the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In transfected COS cells, a deletion mutant of the I1f fragment (approximately equal to 2.3 kbp) gave rise to a truncated protein (Mr, approximately equal to 52,000), whereas the BamHI K fragment yielded a full-sized Mr 78,000 species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding indicates that EBNA is encoded by <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines or in immortalized lymphocytes, variation in the size of the I1f fragment correlated with the apparent molecular weight of the EBNA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBNA is truncated in two Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, Raji (Mr, 67,000) and P3JHR-1 (Mr, 70,000), which have deletion mutant I1f genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBNA in human lymphoid cells bearing a complete I1f fragment as part of the entire EBV genome is the same size (Mr, 78,000) as EBNA found after gene transfer of I1f alone into mouse or monkey cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these expression systems make an authentic EBNA after transfer of the appropriate EBV genes </plain></SENT>
