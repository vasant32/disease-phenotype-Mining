<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two established North American Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines were studied by chromosomal banding techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The SU-AmB-1 line previously shown to be negative for the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was found to have, among other changes, a translocation from the long arm (q) of chromosome 8 onto 14q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SU-AmB-2 line, which contains the EBV genome, also displayed the same 8/14 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results were compared with data from three EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines derived from patients with African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that a translocation from 8q onto 14q occurs in both African and North American Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and that this abnormality apparently is not related directly to EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This chromosome translocation therefore may be an important event in the development of human lymphocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, analogous to the occurrence of the Philadelphia chromosome rearrangement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
