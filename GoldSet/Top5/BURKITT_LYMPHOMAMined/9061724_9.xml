<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 1993, 53,988 visits were made to the ED of an urban children's hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six hundred ninety-six patients (1.3%) had a chief complaint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Half of these visits, distributed randomly throughout the year, were chosen for review; total sample size was 288 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient age ranged from two to 18 years (2-5 years, 24.3%; 6-12 years, 57.6%; 13-18 years, 18.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of ED diagnoses included <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> illness (39.2%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> (16.0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (15.6%), post-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (6.6%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">streptococcal pharyngitis</z:e> (4.9%), and tension <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (4.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> were identified at the time of ED visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only serious neurologic conditions diagnosed were 15 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (5.2%), one shunt malfunction, one newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, one Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patient with newly diagnosed <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> infiltration, and one punctate <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> post head trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two thirds of patients had radiologic and/or laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Positive findings were as follows: 45.6% of sinus radiographs, 16.3% of rapid streptococcal antigen tests, 60.9% of lumbar punctures, and 19.0% of brain imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of serious and nonserious conditions as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was compared to data from general EDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serious conditions presenting with the chief complaint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in the pediatric ED were not common in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most frequent diagnoses in our review were <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> illness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, in contrast to adult studies in which tension <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> were most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only 6.6% of patients had serious neurologic diagnoses, which is in the range reported for general EDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of the serious conditions in our study, 80% were <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
