<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients and 13 health volunteers entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were isolated as effector cells, and Daudi (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) cells as target cell, the cytotoxicity and ADCC mediated by Rituximab (10 microg/ml) of PBMNC at different E:T ratios were performed by standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-release-assay in vitro with or without IL-2-activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis was performed to identify PBMNC phenotype with or without IL-2-activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A marked decrease of cytotoxicity and Rituximab mediated ADCC in the patients as compared with that in health volunteers, the results being (5.80 +/- 1.16)%, (14.32 +/- 1.50)% and (14.29 +/- 1.68)%, (24.14 +/- 1.53)% (t = 3.693, P = 0.001 and t = 3.372, P = 0.003) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decrease was correlated with the therapeutic effect of Rituximab (r = 0.781, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxicity and Rituximab mediated ADCC in the patients could be partly recovered after IL-2 activation from (5.80 +/- 1.16)%, (14.32 +/- 1.50)% to (15.43 +/- 2.62)%, (35.79 +/- 2.58)% (t = 3.35, P = 0.003 and t = 7.17, P &lt; 0.001) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It may be a useful method for predicting the effect of Rituximab in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients to analyze the cytotoxicity and ADCC of their PBMNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The impaired activity of PBMNC could be partly recovered when IL-2 was administered before the use of Rituximab </plain></SENT>
