<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their detection is often impaired by technical problems, including the distribution of the breakpoints over large genomic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study reports a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method which allows the detection of specific chromosomal breakpoints in tissue sections from routinely fixed, paraffin-embedded samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hybridization was performed after demasking the DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previously validated locus-specific probes (cosmids, PACs) flanking the BCL1, BCL2 regions and similar new probes for the MYC breakpoint region were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cases studied were five mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) and five follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL), selected on the basis of a previously proved t(11;14) and t(14;18) and five randomly chosen Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), as well as 21 negative control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples, hybridization signals of sufficient intensity were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three different algorithms were used to score the hybridization signals in tissue sections, two of them taking into account the nuclei and their signal distribution indicative of chromosomal break, and one only considering the colocalization or segregation of the signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In control tissues, these algorithms resulted in cut-off levels of 9.1%, 1.3%, or 10.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples the percentages of abnormal cells/signals ranged from 28% to 80%, 13% to 49%, and 40% to 70%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that small locus-specific probes can be used in FISH for regular detection of translocation breakpoints on routine paraffin tissue sections </plain></SENT>
