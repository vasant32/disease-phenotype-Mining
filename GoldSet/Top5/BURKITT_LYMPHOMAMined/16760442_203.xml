<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The distinction between Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used transcriptional and genomic profiling to define Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> more precisely and to distinguish subgroups in other types of mature aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed gene-expression profiling using Affymetrix U133A GeneChips with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from 220 mature aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including a core group of 8 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> World Health Organization (WHO) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A molecular signature for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was generated, and chromosomal abnormalities were detected with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization and array-based comparative genomic hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We used the molecular signature for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to identify 44 cases: 11 had the morphologic features of diffuse large-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 4 were unclassifiable mature aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 29 had a classic or atypical Burkitt's morphologic appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, five did not have a detectable IG-myc Burkitt's translocation, whereas the others contained an IG-myc fusion, mostly in simple karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 176 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> without the molecular signature for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 155 were diffuse large-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these 155 cases, 21 percent had a chromosomal breakpoint at the myc locus associated with complex chromosomal changes and an unfavorable clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our molecular definition of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> clarifies and extends the spectrum of the WHO criteria for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In mature aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> without a gene signature for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, chromosomal breakpoints at the myc locus were associated with an adverse clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
