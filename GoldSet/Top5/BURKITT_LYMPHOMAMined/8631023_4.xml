<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have reported previously a preliminary study of a t(9;14)(p21-22; q11) in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This translocation had rearranged the TCRA/D locus on chromosome band 14q11 and the locus encoding the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene P16INK4/MTS1 (P16) on band 9p21 (D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Duro et al., Oncogene, 11: 21-29, 1995) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present report, the breakpoints were precisely localized on each chromosome partner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the 14q- derivative, the sequence derived from chromosome 9 was interrupted at 1.0 kb upstream of the first exon of P16, close to a consensus recombination heptamer, CACTGTG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the chromosome 14 breakpoint was localized at the end of the TCRD2 (delta 2) segment, and 22 residues with unknown origin were present at the translocation junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the 9p+ derivative, chromosome 9 sequences were in continuity with those displaced onto chromosome 14, and the 14q11 breakpoint was located within TCRJA29 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These features are consistent with aberrant activity of the TCR gene recombinase complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three coding exons of P16 were displaced onto the chromosome 14q-derivative, no P16 transcript was detected in the leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because the region spanning the P16 exon 1 was not inactivated by methylation and because the other P16 allele was deleted, the implication is that the chromosome breakpoint was likely to disrupt regulatory elements involved in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a whole, then, our results show that translocations affecting band 9p21 can participate to the inactivation of P16, thus justifying a systematic survey of translocations of the 9p21 band in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
