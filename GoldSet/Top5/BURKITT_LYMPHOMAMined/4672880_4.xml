<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three out of seven patients tested also showed diminished or absent lymphocytotoxicity when their cells were grown in mixed culture with <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi>-labelled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and absent response has never been observed in a large series of controls similarly tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both test systems impaired reactivity appeared to be partly caused by a factor present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> serum </plain></SENT>
