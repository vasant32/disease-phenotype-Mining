<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although there is convincing evidence of a link between B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) and the proliferation and survival of malignant B cells, previous observations about BLyS expression on B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, BLyS expression on human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines was evaluated by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, specificity of a monoclonal antibody (MAb) against BLyS, was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that MAb B7 was immunoglobulin G(3) (IgG(3)) and recognized recombinant human BLyS specifically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, MAb B7 bound to the histiocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line U937 in dosage-dependent manner, but not the T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Jurkat, suggesting that the cellular binding of MAb B7 was specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using this MAb, BLyS expression on two <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> cell lines (XG-7 and SKO-007) and two Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (Daudi and Raji) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAb B7 did bind to XG- 7 and SKO-007 (66.84% and 79.38% positive cells, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But MAb B7 did not bind Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, Daudi and Raji (4.09% and 3.02% positive cells, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It will be interesting to further analyze the expression of BLyS on B malignant cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, and to evaluate the correlation of its expression and patient prognosis </plain></SENT>
