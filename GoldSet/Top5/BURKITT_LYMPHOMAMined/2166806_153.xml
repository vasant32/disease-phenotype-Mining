<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The two Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) types, EBV-1 and EBV-2, are known to differ in their EBNA-2 genes, which are 64 and 53% identical in their nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Restriction endonuclease maps and serologic analyses detect few other differences between EBV-1 and EBV-2 except in the EBNA-3 gene family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the DNA sequence of the AG876 EBV-2 EBNA-3 coding region and have compared it with known B95-8 EBV-1 EBNA-3 sequences to delineate the extent of divergence between EBV-1 and EBV-2 isolates in their EBNA-3 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The B95-8 and AG876 EBV isolates had nucleotide and amino acid identity levels of 90 and 84%, 88 and 80%, and 81 and 72% for the EBNA-3A, -3B, and -3C genes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, nucleotide sequence identity in the noncoding DNA adjacent to the B95-8 and AG876 EBNA-3 open reading frames was 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used the polymerase chain reaction to demonstrate that five additional EBV-1 isolates and six additional EBV-2 isolates have the type-specific differences in their EBNA-3 genes predicted from the B95-8 or AG876 sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, EBV-1 and EBV-2 are two distinct <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> EBV strains that have significantly diverged at four genetic loci and have maintained type-characteristic differences at each locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The delineation of these sequence differences between EBV-1 and EBV-2 is essential to ongoing molecular dissection of the biologic properties of EBV and of the human immune response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The application of these data to the delineation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> recognized in the EBV-immune T-cell response is also discussed </plain></SENT>
