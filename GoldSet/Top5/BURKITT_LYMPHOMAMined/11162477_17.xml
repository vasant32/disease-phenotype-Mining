<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL) 4 is a potent and critical stimulator of immunoglobulin class switching from IgM to IgE in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IL-4 induces the expression of epsilon germline transcript (epsilonGT), which is critical to initiate IgE production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While searching for molecules that inhibit epsilonGT expression induced by IL-4, we found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenol</z:chebi> strictinin, which was isolated from tea leaves, was able to inhibit the IL-4-induced epsilonGT expression in the human B cell line DND39 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Strictinin also acted on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from healthy donors to inhibit IL-4-induced epsilonGT expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strictinin demonstrated similar inhibitory activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from atopic donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, strictinin decreased ovalbumin-induced IgE production in mice, whereas the production of IgG and IgM was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that the IL-4-induced STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation, which is essential for IL-4-induced epsilonGT expression, was inhibited in DND39 cells upon treatment with strictinin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that strictinin can inhibit IgE production through the inhibition of IL-4-mediated signaling in B cells </plain></SENT>
