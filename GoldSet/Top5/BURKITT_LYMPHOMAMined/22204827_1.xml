<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known, however about the direct effects of type I IFNs on germinal center (GC) B cells, the central components of adaptive B cell responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) lines, as a model system of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human GC B cells, to examine the effect of type I IFNs on the expression of BCL-6, the major regulator of the GC reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that type I IFNs, but not IFNγ, IL-2 and TNFα rapidly down-regulate BCL-6 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, in cell lines derived from endemic, but not from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IFNα-induced down-regulation is specific for BCL-6, independent of Epstein-Barr virus and is not accompanied by IRF-4 up-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IFNα-induced BCL-6 mRNA down-regulation does not require de novo protein synthesis and is specifically inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28814">piceatannol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> MG132 non-specifically prevents, while inhibitors of alternate type I IFN signaling pathways do not inhibit IFNα-induced BCL-6 protein downregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We validate our results with showing that IFNα rapidly down-regulates BCL-6 mRNA in purified mouse <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GC B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results identify type I IFNs as the first group of cytokines that can down-regulate BCL-6 expression directly in GC B cells </plain></SENT>
