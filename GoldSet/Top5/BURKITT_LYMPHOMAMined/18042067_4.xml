<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>c-FLIP, a regulator of caspase 8-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, plays an important role in protecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B and T cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and possibly also in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of contradictory reports about immunohistochemical detection of c-FLIP expression, the aim was to test the specificity of four antibodies in c-FLIP-transfected cells and subsequently to investigate expression of c-FLIP in different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Two of four antibodies were specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> c-FLIP expression was restricted to Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (&gt; 90%) and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and indolent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No expression was detected in primary T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, although expression was observed in one relapsed ALK+ anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of c-FLIP was inversely correlated with caspase 8 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: c-FLIP is important in escape of B cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> follicle centre cell reaction and may thus be an important early event in the development of B-cell-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, non-specific staining of frequently used antibodies might explain discrepancies in different reports of c-FLIP expression </plain></SENT>
