<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms involved in the regulation of BimL protein expression are still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report that BimL expression following BCR activation is not associated with a specific increase of BimL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> but rather to the intron retention structure of the BimEL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, expression of a BimEL cDNA leads in Hela cells leads to the production of both BimEL and BimL proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation of the intron-splicing GT sequence present in the exon 3 results in the production of only BimEL protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of BimEL cDNA resulted in a large increase of BimL expression upon BCR-stimulation, whereas cells transfected with the GT/AA mutated form of BimEL only produced BimEL proteins upon BCR-activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data showed that BimL expression induced by BCR activation may result from the splicing of BimEL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> independently of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> promoter regulation </plain></SENT>
