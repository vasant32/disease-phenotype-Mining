<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In situ cytogenetic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and analysis showed that Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-infected Raji and EBV-producing P3HR-1 cells divide by meiosis and follow the life cycle of malignant cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Meiosis was documented by the presence of condensed chromosomes, "o" chromosome, nuclear vlimata (NVs), NV invasion, extrusion of chromosomes, chromosomal transfer, metaphase fusion and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBV-Raji, EBV-producing P3HR, HIV1-infected MOLT-4 cells (dividing by meiosis) and human spermatozoa (cellular products of meiosis) were highly sensitive to the endogenous inhibitor (CANP-I) of calcium-activated neutral proteinase (CANP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CANP-I-treated virally infected and virus producing cells showed <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and disappearance of immunofluorescent <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigens, documenting the anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> action of CANP-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CANP-I-treated spermatozoa exhibited arrested motility with subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> documenting the in vitro spermicidal action of CANP-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The testis of treated Wistar rats with 0.25 U CANP-I/gr body weight for six days, were devoid of spermatozoa, with pronounced toxicity and exfoliation of spermatocytes and spermatids, indicating the contraceptive action of CANP-I via spermatogenetic arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that CANP-I is an anti-meiotic agent inhibiting CANP associated with meiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hence CANP-I is a promising agent against various diseases involving meiosis </plain></SENT>
