<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously described a transcription unit on human chromosome 8, designated as PVT, that is consistently disrupted by the minority forms of translocations [t(2;8) and t(8;22)] in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PVT begins 57 kilobase pairs downstream of the proto-oncogene MYC and is more than 200 kilobase pairs in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to explore the pathogenic impact of translocations affecting PVT, we have characterized further the structure and transcription of the locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, PVT is transcribed into a variety of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, the diversity of which remains unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alleles of PVT affected by translocations give rise to additional <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> arise from a fusion of the first exon of PVT on chromosome 8 to the constant region of an immunoglobulin light chain on either chromosome 2 or chromosome 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have found no evidence that any of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or abnormal transcripts of PVT give rise to a protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the pathogenic effects of the variant translocations in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are not executed by a gene situated in a vicinity of the chromosomal breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Instead, our data leave open the possibility that the effects of the translocations may be mediated by activation of the relatively distant MYC gene </plain></SENT>
