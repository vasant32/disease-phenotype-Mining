<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rearranged and non-rearranged alleles of Walker cells were found to be about equally sensitive towards digestion with DNAase I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A DNAase I hypersensitive site was mapped 0.13 kb upstream of the leader segment of the rearranged VK genes; it comprises a region in which promoter-like regulatory elements were discovered recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional hypersensitive sites are located further upstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A hypersensitive site in the JK-CK intron coincides with a putative tissue specific enhancer element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A hypersensitive region down-stream of CK overlaps with the cleavage/polyadenylation recognition signal which is flanked by sequences related to the above mentioned putative regulatory sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The coincidence between DNAase I hypersensitive sites and those sequences may be functionally significant </plain></SENT>
