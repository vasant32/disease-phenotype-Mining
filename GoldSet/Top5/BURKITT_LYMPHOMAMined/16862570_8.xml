<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Karyotypic abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) have been described extensively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, to the authors' knowledge, very limited studies have focused on the secondary chromosomal abnormalities in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> as compared with those of adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and on their prognostic impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pediatric and adult patients at 2 institutions, with a morphologic diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, pretherapy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> karyotype available, and t(8;14), t(8;22), or t(2;8) present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 33 children and 37 adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients (95%) had Stage III/IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences noted in karyotype complexity and the nature of the chromosomal abnormalities between these 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of chromosomes 13 (13q) and 22 (22q) had a negative impact on prognosis in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In adults, abnormalities of chromosome 17 appeared to have a negative impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggest that karyotypic information can be used for refining risk stratification in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
