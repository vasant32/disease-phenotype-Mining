<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The thioether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> derivative ilmofosine (BM41440), a selective inhibitor of protein kinase C, is a new anticancer drug presently undergoing Phase II clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have examined the influence of the compound on cell cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ilmofosine was found to induce a dose-dependent accumulation of CA46 cells in G2-phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>G2-arrest correlated with suppression of cdc2 kinase activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ilmofosine did not affect cdc2 kinase activity in vitro, consistent with an indirect locus of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ilmofosine treated CA46 cells failed to accumulate hyperphosphorylated-cdc2/cyclin B1 complexes that are observed when G2-arrest is induced by either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi> or ionizing radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, cdc2 became dephosphorylated and cyclin B1 protein levels decreased as ilmofosine treated cells became arrested in G2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that ilmofosine down-regulates cdc2 kinase activation through a mechanism that affects the formation of cdc2/cyclin B1 complexes </plain></SENT>
