<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene promoters contain two conserved upstream sequence elements, octamer and heptamer, both of which are required for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell type-specific promoter function in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The octamer sequence motif 5'-ATGCAAAT-3', and its precise inverse, are strongly conserved in heavy- and light-chain gene promoters and are important determinants for the lymphoid-specific function of these promoters and of the heavy-chain enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The heptameric sequence element with the consensus 5'-CTCATGA-3' (refs 3 and 4) is also required in addition to the octamer for full lymphoid-specific activity of heavy-chain promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although these two elements have no sequence similarity, they are both recognized in vitro by the ubiquitous octamer transcription factor OTF-1 (reviewed refs 13 and 14) and the lymphoid-specific OTF-2 (reviewed in refs 15 and 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show that purified OTF-2 binds cooperatively to the immunoglobulin heptamer and octamer elements so that interaction with the octamer element facilitates binding of OTF-2 to the heptamer motif </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More important, cooperativity in OTF-2 binding is closely mirrored by functional cooperation between the heptamer and octamer elements in activating transcription from the heavy-chain promoter in vitro </plain></SENT>
