<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its evaluation requires cytogenetic or fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) studies, which are expensive and not widely available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to find an immunohistochemical marker able to be used as a screening tool to identify MYC translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Aggressive B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in which MYC status was assessed during their diagnostic work-up between 2007 and 2010 were collected, their immunophenotype was re-evaluated, and were stratified according to the Hans algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two tissue microarrays were built in order to evaluate MYC protein expression with a commercially available antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study was performed on 56 specimens: nine Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (eight translocated), 45 DLBCLs (nine translocated) and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with intermediate features (both translocated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only MYC protein expression detected by immunohistochemistry correlated with MYC translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No relationship was seen between MYC gene copies and protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MYC protein expression detected by immunohistochemistry using a commercially available antibody correlates with MYC gene translocation, and could be used as a screening tool to select those cases in which confirmatory genetic testing is mandatory </plain></SENT>
