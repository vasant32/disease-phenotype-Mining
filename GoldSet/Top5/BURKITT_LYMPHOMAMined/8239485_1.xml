<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In immunocompromised transplant patients, MF can cause a distinctive <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> which is a clinical look-alike to Candida <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp>, the latter of more potentially devastating significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recovery of MF in culture is dependent upon the addition to culture media of an exogenous source of fatty acids, such as olive oil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The addition of an extra Sabourauds plate with an olive oil overlay to the routine set of media used to inoculate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> skin biopsy specimens in order to detect MF is labor-intensive and not cost-effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, MF may not be isolated in cases of MF <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> unless the clinical microbiology laboratory is put on alert by the clinical suspicions of the attending physician, or by histopathologic findings suggestive of <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> revealed by review of surgical pathology slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical, pathological, and microbiological findings of two cases of MF <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> are presented where an interactive approach featuring communication between the microbiologist, the surgical pathologist, and the clinician guided the microbiology laboratory to the isolation and identification of isolates of MF that were clinically-relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cases underscore how a combined approach which features communication between the laboratory and the clinical services always provides superior guidance in the diagnosis and therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
