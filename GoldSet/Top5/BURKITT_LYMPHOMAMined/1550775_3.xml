<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean cell cycle time (tg) was similar in lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> of precursor B cell and T cell origin (115 h and 102 h, respectively), while B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> had a mean tg of only 25 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between the LI and the GF (r = 0.892) and a negative correlation between the LI and tg (r = -0.908) could be detected in childhood lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of neoplastic precursor B cells was compared with the proliferation of presumably <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> terminal transferase (TdT) positive bone marrow cells that, according to the immunophenotype, correspond mainly to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> precursor B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although mean ts was identical in both cell populations (18-19 h), the neoplastic cell population showed a significantly longer mean tg than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterpart (115 h and 65 h, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, if malignant and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> precursor B cell populations with a similar LI were compared, the difference in tg disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a down-regulation of leukaemic cell proliferation by an increasing cell mass is postulated for most cases of untreated precursor B cell ALL </plain></SENT>
