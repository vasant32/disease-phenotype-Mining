<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These subjects were cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e>, naso-pharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disorders</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A blind study was conducted in two separate laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-RANA was detected by indirect immunofluorescence on RAJI cells synchronised in phase G1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a very strict correlation between anti-RANA and anti-EBNA with no correlation between anti-RANA and anti-EA or anti-VCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In another experiment, 15 coded sera from patients with classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> were tested following adsorption of the rheumatoid factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One serum was found to be devoid of both anti-RANA and anti-EBNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that anti-RANA is widely distributed outside of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> and they question the distinction between EBNA and RANA, as the antibody titres directed against these antigens are regularly linked together </plain></SENT>
