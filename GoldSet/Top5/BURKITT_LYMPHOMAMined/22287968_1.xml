<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the treatment of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) from the time of its discovery in Africa up to the present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pioneer investigators explored the value of chemotherapy since surgery and radiation were not effective modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete response was observed with many drugs used as single agents, but Ziegler and colleagues showed that patients resistant to one drug could achieve cure and potentially long-term survival with other drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> (VCR), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) was shown to be active, but a survival advantage compared to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> alone could not be demonstrated because effective <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> prophylactic therapy, in the form of intrathecal therapy, was not given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A recent re-evaluation of this regimen in Africa with multiple doses of intrathecal therapy compares favourably with recent studies of single agent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>, and other drugs have been shown to be non-cross resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Optimal results for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> probably require 5 or 6 effective drugs along with intrathecal therapy, using MTX and Ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Africa, doses must be lower, because of limitations in supportive care, but in technically advanced countries cure rates in excess of 90% can be obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rituximab may improve the results in some patient groups and allow less intensive therapy without a reduction in survival in others </plain></SENT>
