<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We designed a protocol that included 2 months of intensive Cytoxan (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>; Bristol-Myers Co, Evansville, IN), high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX), high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (ara-C), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> (HiC-COM) to improve event-free survival (EFS) for patients with advanced-stage Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also wished to test the feasibility of rapidly cycling Cytoxan and high-dose ara-C based on signs of early marrow recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients including 12 with stage III Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and eight with stage IV Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or B-cell ALL were entered onto this pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rate of complete remission was 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients have relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2-year actuarial EFS was 75% (median follow-up, 37 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the initial five patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026976" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transverse myelitis</z:e>, which we believe may have been secondary to the concomitant administration of intrathecal (IT) and high-dose systemic ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this short but intensive regimen is highly effective for patients with advanced Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and B-cell ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EFS has improved over previous less intensive regimens, and is comparable to regimens of longer duration </plain></SENT>
