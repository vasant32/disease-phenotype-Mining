<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Four steroids and one <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> were evaluated for their effects on 12-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45127">phorbol 13-acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>)-induced and Epstein-Barr virus-induced early antigens (EBV-EA) in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Continuous treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="16962">cortisone</z:chebi> inhibited <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-induced EBV-EA to varying degrees, but the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> N-alpha-p-tosyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi> chloromethyl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi>-HCl (TLCK) had no significant effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the agents tested inhibited EBV- induced EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effect of the steroids was reversible since the removal of these agents resulted in recovery of the percentage of EBV-EA-positive cells in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-treated cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results were in agreement with the in vivo experiments of other investigators, who demonstrated inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519689" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor promotion</z:e> with steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since TLCK failed to inhibit <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-induced EA, it is unlikely that induction of EA by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> is the result of production of proteases </plain></SENT>
