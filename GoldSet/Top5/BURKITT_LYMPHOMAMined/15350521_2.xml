<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We developed an assay allowing the detection and quantification of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after transient expression of apoptotic genes in B- and T-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For efficient gene transfer, B- and T-cells were electroporated under optimized conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To blind out the high background of non-transfected cells and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> caused by the electroporation procedure itself, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was co-transfected with the gene of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, if the gene of interest was a potent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inducer, most successfully transfected cells were killed before GFP was expressed to levels sufficient for standard flow cytometry analysis or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After staining of the transfected cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI), very few GFP+/PI+ cells were detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To overcome this problem, the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate induced by the transiently expressed gene was determined as the reduction of living green cells in the apoptotic versus a reference sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was achieved by an advanced flow cytometrical analysis quantifying the number of surviving green cells in normalised sample volumes directly relating to the number of initially transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functioning of the assay was demonstrated by transient transfection of the potent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inducers TNF-receptor-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> domain protein (TRADD) and a fusion protein of the transmembrane domain of the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus and the signaling domain of TNF-receptor 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We successfully applied the assay to the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BJAB and the T-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line Jurkat </plain></SENT>
