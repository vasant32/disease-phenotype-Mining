<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously found that a minor subfraction of the human genomic DNA, corresponding to 2500-3000 nonrepetitive sequences of 3 kilobases each and designated as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-activated DNA (TaDNA) was transcriptionally active in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and almost inactive in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes growing in vitro following integration of the Epstein-Barr virus genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the neoplastic cells in culture or primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>) studied contained transcripts from most of the TaDNA sequences found in malignant lymphoblasts whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells growing in vitro contained only a few TaDNA transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is shown in the present study that treatments of the myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> HL60 cells with various inducers of cell differentiation (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi>, mezerein, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, teleocidin) caused a dose-dependent reduction of the level of TaDNA transcripts, correlated with the diminution of c-myc transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> treatment had this same effect on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (Raji or Namalwa) but the opposite effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells (Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphocytes or fetal fibroblasts) where it enhanced the formation of Ta-DNA transcripts up to the levels found in untreated malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest two conclusions (a) TaDNA corresponds to a multigenic set which seems to be involved in modulation of the malignant phenotype and (b) depending on the origin of the cells, agents like 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> may operate either as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> promoters or as differentiation inducers through the control of TaDNA expression </plain></SENT>
