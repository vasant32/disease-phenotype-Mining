<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the distribution of various subtypes of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ML) appears to differ by geographical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND DESIGN: studying the patterns of ML retrospectively in a previously uncharted country (Iraq) and to compare it with patterns observed regionally and worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and seventy <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients referred to two major histopathology referral centers in Northern Iraq, were categorized according to the WHO classification, using <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and appropriate immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 205 (76%) non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) and 65 (24%) Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the NHL, 91% were B-cell and 9% T-cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common NHL was Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) which comprised 52.2% of NHL, followed by Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) at 14.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter were mostly intestinal primaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) were infrequent constituting 2.9 % of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extranodal primaries were found in 48.3% of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) included 48% nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (NS) and 37% mixed cellularity (MC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> were nodal primaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among NHL, the high frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, extra nodal primaries and intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, and the infrequency of FL in northern Iraq, is similar to reports from nearby countries but differs considerably from the West and Far East, indicating a shared regional Middle East influence on non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast to earlier Iraqi and regional studies on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, NS has surpassed MC as the most frequent histological subtype in Northern Iraq </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This trend probably reflects the increasing urbanization that has taken place in this region </plain></SENT>
