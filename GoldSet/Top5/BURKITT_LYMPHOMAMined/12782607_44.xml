<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LMP1 interacts with members of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor-associated factor family, as well as with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> domain, resulting in induction of nuclear factor-kappaB, the p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase pathway, and the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase activator protein 1-signaling cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The binding of Janus kinase 3 results in activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The domain structure of LMP1 has been mapped extensively, but the quantitative contribution of distinct LMP1 domains to the efficiency of B-cell proliferation by EBV has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the maxi-EBV system, which allows us to introduce and study mutations in the context of the complete EBV genome, a panel of 10 EBV mutants with alterations in the LMP1 gene locus was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutant EBVs were tested for their efficiency to induce and maintain proliferation of clonal B-cell lines in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly and with reduced frequency, EBV mutants which deleted LMP1's COOH terminus, transmembrane domains, or the entire open reading frame were able to generate proliferating B-cell clones that were dependent on the presence of human fibroblast feeder cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A B-cell clone carrying the LMP1-null mutant EBV genome was also analyzed for oncogenicity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that LMP1 is critical but not mandatory for the generation of proliferating B cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LMP1 functions greatly contribute to EBV's transformation potential and appear essential for its oncogenicity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> mice </plain></SENT>
