<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The F(ab')2 fragments of IgG antibody were as potent as intact Ig, while the Fab and Fc fragments gave no induction, indicating that cross-linking of surface Ig was required for the induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously with EBV induction, anti-Ig inhibited the uptake of 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This inhibition was also seen in EBV-genome-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no effect on virus induction and cell growth was noted in lymphoblastoid lines of non-neoplastic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possible relationship between cell differentiation and latency of EBV-carrier state is discussed </plain></SENT>
