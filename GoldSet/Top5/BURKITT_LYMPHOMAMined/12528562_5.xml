<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The cells of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji were incubated with 1.0 mumol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (DEX) for 2, 4 and 8 h, then stained with Annexin V-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> conjugated) which was used to detect the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the out membrane resulting from a loss of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> asymmetry in the early stage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and also stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI) which allows the analysis of secondary necrotic cells related with cell membrane and DNA damage, then apoptotic cells was quantified by flow cytometry (FMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Annexin+/PI- and Annexin+/PI+ cells were sorted by fluoresence-activated cell sorter (FACS), and identified by electron microscopy (EM) and DNA gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results revealed that the percentage of apoptotic cells was increased and correlated well with incubation time (r = 0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of this method was shown by its detection limit 0.02%; the method was reproducible, and the coefficient variance (CV) was 4.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the Annexin+/PI- and Annexin+/PI+ cells were identified as apoptotic and necrotic cells under EM, and the DNA extracted from the Annexin+/PI- cells was characterized by "ladder pattern" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Annexin V assay for analyzing apoptotic cells is specific, sensitive, accurate, reproducible and quantitative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> investigation </plain></SENT>
