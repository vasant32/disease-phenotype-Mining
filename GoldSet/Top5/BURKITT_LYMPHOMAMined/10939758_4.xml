<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> presenting as <z:mp ids='MP_0002020'>spontaneous tumor</z:mp> lysis syndrome (TLS) complicated by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo> and anuric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> presumed to be secondary to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) using a dialysate flow rate of 2.5 l/h, and a replacement fluid rate of 1.5 l/h (administered in pre-dilution) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean clearances during CVVHDF for <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> were, respectively, 55.8 +/- 3.8, 48.9 +/- 2.6, 45.1 +/- 2.6 and 47.0 +/- 3.3 ml/min (or 80, 70, 65 and 68 l/day, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> decreased from 42 to 9 mmol/l, 533 to 189 micromol/l, 1980 to 372 micromol/l, and 2.0 to 1.4 mmol/l, respectively, after 48 hours of CVVHDF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previously, we reported the use of continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD) at a high dialysate flow rate of 4 l/h for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> and TLS, which provided excellent continuous clearances of small molecular weight solutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This last modality was very efficient and prevented deleterious rebound in serum solute concentrations frequently observed in TLS after intermittent hemodialysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that high-dialysate flow rate CAVHD was a more potent form of treatment than conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With recent advances in technology, veno-venous continuous renal replacement therapies are becoming more popular than arterio-venous modalities since they are safer and less cumbersome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, flow rates being precisely regulated, solute clearances can be steadily maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With CVVHDF flow rates as used in this report, we achieved excellent solute clearances and metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose CVVHDF as an ideal treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> in TLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, CVVHDF is an advantageous alternative to treat TLS complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
