<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, no study has investigated the incidence of OKS in African populations affected by the HIV/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> epidemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is, therefore, the purpose of this study to assess the burden of OKS in the Zimbabwean population over a 10 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A descriptive epidemiological study was undertaken to assess the burden of OKS by determining the frequencies, incidence and cumulative rates, the lifetime risk and chances of developing OKS according to site (topography), gender, age, race/ethnic origin of the Zimbabwean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 445 incident cases of OKS from the upper and lower lips, oral vestibule, retromolar area, floor of mouth, tongue, cheek, mucosa, gums, hard and soft palate were accessed from the Zimbabwe National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry (ZNCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases from the skin, pharynx, larynx and the major salivary glands were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SETTING: This comprised the population of Zimbabwe during the 10 year period 1988-1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The population figures used for this study were fro the 1992 Census Zimbabwe National Report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study population was standardized by the direct method against the world standard population to calculate the age standardized incidence rate (ASIR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The SPSS statistical software programme (SPSS Inc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>2001, USA) was used for the statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OKS comprised 0.92% of total body <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and 51% of oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with a mean age of study cases of 37.6 years and median age of32 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Histology of the primary (64.5%) and clinical diagnosis (34.6%) were the predominant methods of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>OKS affected nearly only blacks and males more than females, with a male to female ratio of 1.9:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The most affected age groups by OKS were the 30 to 34 years for male and 25 to 29 years for both females and the whole population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Other notable peaks in OKS rates were in the 0 to 4 year and the 75+ age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>OKS mostly affected the palate (70.2%) followed by, in descending order, the tongue (13.3%) and mouth (8.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The age adjusted age standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of OKS exponentially increased the entire study period bypassing oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (OSCC) as the predominant oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, OKS accounted for 98% while the balance comprised Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018923" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haemangiosarcoma</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> not specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: OKS was the commonest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> of young adults affecting males more than females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>OKS steady increased for the entire study period overtaking <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> in 1994 to become the commonest oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> for the remainder of the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The palate was the most affected intra-oral site by OKS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These findings are attributable to the high human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> (HIV) rates recorded for </plain></SENT>
