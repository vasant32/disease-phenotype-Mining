<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> are characterized by chromosomal translocations juxtaposing the c-myc gene on chromosome 8 to one of the immunoglobulin loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) on chromosome 14 are found in approximately 75%-90% of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint regions are located over a wide range on both chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: To detect the translocations, we developed a PCR method to generate long products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After extraction of genomic DNA (QiaAmp System, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), DNA was amplified using a mixture of Taq and Pwo polymerases (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several primer pairs from the S mu, JH, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29433">CH1</z:chebi> and the C alpha regions on IgH and from exon 1 and intron 1 of the c-myc gene were tested in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cells from 20 children with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> characterized by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">FAB-L3</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 11/20 patients, recombinations between chromosomes 8 and 14 could be detected with our primer pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PCR products from 800 to 3700 bp in length were obtained reproducibly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After amplification, the products were characterized by restriction enzyme digestion, hybridization, and in part by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This PCR-based method will allow us (1) to determine the localization of chromosomal breakpoints in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> material, (2) to investigate whether distinct breakpoints are associated with treatment outcome, and (3) to detect the presence of minimal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> cells during or after therapy </plain></SENT>
