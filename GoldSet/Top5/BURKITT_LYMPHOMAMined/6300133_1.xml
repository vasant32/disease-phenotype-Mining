<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A high frequency (9%-14.5%) of catenated dimers, circular dimers, or oligomers were found in samples from Epstein-Barr-virus-(EBV) transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These complex forms of mtDNA were present in much lower frequencies in lymphocytes isolated from donor blood (1.3%-4.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar low frequencies were found with primary fibroblasts (1.1%) or freshly isolated monkey liver cells (2.1%) </plain></SENT>
