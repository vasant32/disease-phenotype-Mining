<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have carried out a screening for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 51 children with B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-six highly polymorphic microsatellite markers located in subtelomeric areas of every chromosome arm were analyzed in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allelic losses were encountered at 21 of the 46 loci tested (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of LOH at a given locus was usually &lt; 10% and fractional allelic loss, calculated as the ratio of chromosomal arms displaying loss among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> informative arms for each patient, ranged from 0.025 to 0.31 (mean, 0.063) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study provides further evidence that deletional events are a major type of genetic alteration found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diversity of the loci displaying LOH suggests that, as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, numerous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes are likely to participate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the overall low frequency of LOH, as well as the absence of microsatellite instability suggest that the genetic instability is lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> than in most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
