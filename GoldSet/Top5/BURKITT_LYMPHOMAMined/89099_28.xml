<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results from invesigations with these sera also indicated that these major proteins were not related to EBV-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigens (VCA) or the virus-associated early antigen (EA) complexes as defined by immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lactoperoxidase-labelled 170,000 molecular weight component was not significantly glycosylated and, therefore, could not be categorized as a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> on the basis of this study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results from these investigations, therefore, indicated that the EBV-induced MA complex was composed of four major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> and one nonglycosylated high mol. wt protein </plain></SENT>
