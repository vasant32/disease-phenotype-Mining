<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this report we describe the synthesis and biological characterization of two series of sirtuins' inhibitors (SIRTi), designed as simplification products of the previously reported SIRT1-selective inhibitor MC2141 (4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first series (5a-t) we report a number of 2-substituted-1,2-dihydrobenzo[f]chromen-3-ones with a marked selectivity for the inhibition of SIRT2 over SIRT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some of such derivatives showed also high pro-apoptotic (5i and 5l) and/or cytodifferentiating (5d, 5i, and 5o) properties in a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line (U937) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second group of SIRTi (6a-q) is characterized by some analogues of cambinol (3), a well known SIRTi active against the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such compounds, differently from the unselective prototype, are endowed with a selective inhibition of SIRT1 over SIRT2, and, in some cases (6j, 6k, and 6q), are more efficient than 3 to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in U937 cells </plain></SENT>
