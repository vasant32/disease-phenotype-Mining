<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The BAL-KHc and BAL-KHs exhibited B-cell characteristics with positive cell markers for CD19, CD20, CD21 and HLA-DR antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin with gamma and kappa chains was demonstrated on the cultured and fresh <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells lacked the Epstein-Barr virus genome and expressed abnormal chromosome constitutions including a t(8;14)(q24;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that the cell lines present B-cell characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BAL-KHc cells showed different cell growth characteristics and cell surface marker profile compared to those of the BAL-KHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These variations suggest that the BAL-KHc cells were probably frozen at a different stage of B-cell maturation from those of BAL-KHs, although both cell lines originated from the cells in the same peripheral blood sample of the patient </plain></SENT>
