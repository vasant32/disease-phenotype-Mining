<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An expression plasmid for pro-UKDGS1, pIH1UK delta GS1SEd1-5 was constructed and introduced into Namalwa KJM-1, a lymphoblastoid cell line adapted to serum-free medium, and cells resistant to G418 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">Methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amongst them, the highest pro-UK delta GS1 producer (resistant to 200 nM of MTX), clone 2-9, was selected and used for further studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under the conventional conditions, i.e. at 37 degrees C in serum-free ITPSGF medium (based on RPMI-1640 medium), the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> structure of pro-UK delta GS1 produced by clone 2-9 mainly consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33984">fucose</z:chebi> (Fuc)-containing biantennary complex-type <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (Dex), changed the carbohydrate contents in the media, and a shift down of incubation temperature caused a change in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> structure of pro-UK delta GS1 from mainly Fuc-containing biantennary to mainly Fuc-containing tri- and tetraantennary complex-type <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The modulated pro-UK delta GS1 showed superior in vivo activity for a canine femoral <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> formed by inserting a copper-coil </plain></SENT>
