<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Long-term follow-up of cranial CT scans of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and evaluation of the influence of chemo- and radiotherapy on the CCT changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: CCT scans of 68 children with non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> were analyzed retrospectively for signs of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and changes in density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated between 1981 and 1990 at the St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anna Childrens Hospital Vienna according to the ALL-BFM protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children were examined with CCT in defined periods from diagnosis until 3 years after cessation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a control group served 69 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> who had not received corticoids or cranial irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the initial examination 56% of the ALL-patients showed CCT changes, 85% of these patients had already received corticoids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control group only 20% of the CCTs were found abnormal (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both groups an age-dependence was found: 64% of the ALL-patients under five years of age and 22% of the patients above 5 years had initial CCT changes (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the control group 39% of the patients under five years of age and 7% of the older patients showed CCT changes at the beginning of treatment (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest incidence of abnormal CCT scans (68%) was seen during intensive chemo- and radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Until the end of therapy the incidence of abnormal CCTs decreased to 32% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After cessation of antileukemic therapy 35% of the patients whose <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-prophylaxis included cranial irradiation, and 12% of the non-irradiated patients had abnormal CCT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Corticoids can cause reversible signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the assessment of CCTs a physiological age-dependence of the volume of the CSF compartment has to be taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The main reason for non-reversible CCT changes is the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>- prophylaxis, above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cranial irradiation, whereby younger children seem to be particular vulnerable </plain></SENT>
