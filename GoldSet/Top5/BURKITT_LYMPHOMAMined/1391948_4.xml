<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Samples from 8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors, 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), and 7 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in remission were cultured in IL-2 (100 U/mL) or IL-2 (100 U/mL) plus anti-CD3 (10 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> as well as PBMC samples demonstrated significant synergy between IL-2 and anti-CD3 in the promotion of proliferation as measured by 3H <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation on day 5 (P less than .001) or fold increase in cell number on day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cryopreserved marrow specimens had equally rapid proliferation as fresh <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> when cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 + IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-CD3 concentrations of 3, 11, 33, and 100 ng/mL augmented proliferation similarly in the presence of IL-2 (0.1 to 100 U/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean fold increases in cell number of both marrow- and blood-derived cultures after 14 days were significantly higher for anti-CD3 + IL-2-stimulated cultures compared with cultures stimulated with IL-2 only (50- to 200-fold increase in cell number; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of remission <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> and PBMC from ALL and NHL patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls showed equivalent growth rates of activated cultures at 7, 14, and 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Marrow purging with immunotoxin anti-CD19 pokeweed antiviral protein plus 4HC had no significant effect on proliferation of anti-CD3 + IL-2-stimulated <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> cultures in patients with ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cytolytic activity of IL-2- and IL-2 + anti-CD3-activated PBMC and <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> cultures was assessed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release assays using K562 (natural killer ([NK]-sensitive), Daudi (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-, NK-resistant), and Nalm-6 (ALL-, lymphokine-activated killer [LAK]-resistant) cell lines and cryopreserved ALL blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cytolytic activity on a per-cell basis (percent cytotoxicity at an effector:target ratio of 30:1) was similar in IL-2-activated PBMC- and <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>-derived cultures from ALL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> activated with anti-CD3 plus IL-2 killed Daudi significantly less well than IL-2-activated cultures on days 12 and 19 (P = .03); no significant differences were observed in lysis of LAK-resistant Nalm-6 or cryopreserved ALL blast targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dose response of anti-CD3 augmentation of Daudi and Nalm-6 killing was different in IL-2- and IL-2 + anti-CD3-stimulated cultures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
