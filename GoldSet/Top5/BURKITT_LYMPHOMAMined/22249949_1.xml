<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most potent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in the present study had IC(50) values of 9-23 µm against human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and murine B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nonhaemolytic (EC(50)  &gt; 200 µm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most promising <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 10e also demonstrated low toxicity against human embryonic lung fibroblast cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and exceptional proteolytic stability </plain></SENT>
