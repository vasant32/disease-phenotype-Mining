<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In combination, these markers were informative among 96% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">Minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) was followed up in 23 of these patients with available materials over a period varying from 8 to 54 months with at least one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-specific probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In most children, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> was decreased continuously to an ultimately undetectable level within 6 to 12 months after remission induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient exhibited low-level residual leukemic cells for 4 years before the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> turned negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another patient remained in complete remission for 45 months, although a positive signal was detected at 34 months using TCR delta probe, but was negative with a TCR gamma marker which was positive at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In three patients who relapsed, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> either persisted through the clinical course or became positive and eventually increased 3-11 months before clinical relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggested that the combined use of multiple gene markers is a valuable tool for the PCR-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> detection, since it can cover most ALL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, long-term follow-up of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> is helpful for determining the dosage as well as the period of maintenance chemotherapy and for predicting impending relapse </plain></SENT>
