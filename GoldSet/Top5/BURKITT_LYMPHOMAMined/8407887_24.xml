<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ras oncogene product p21ras requires farnesylation and subsequent plasma membrane association for its transforming activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This key post-translational modification is catalyzed by p21ras farnesyltransferase, which transfers <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24017">farnesyl</z:chebi> from farnesylpyrophosphate to the cysteine of the CA1A2X carboxyl-terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48030">tetrapeptide</z:chebi> of p21ras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present report, we describe potent inhibition of p21ras farnesyltransferase by CA1A2X peptidomimetics containing no peptidic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> bonds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We synthesized a series of CA1A2X analogues where the 2 aliphatic amino acids A1 and A2 were replaced by a hydrophobic spacer, 3-aminomethylbenzoic acid (AMBA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The peptidomimetic Cys-AMBA-Met, inhibits p21ras farnesyltransferase from human colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (COLO-205) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Daudi) with IC50 values of 60 and 120 nM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cys-AMBA-Met is 3-, 8-, and 9-fold (COLO-205) and 2-, 5-, and 7-fold (Daudi) more potent than the corresponding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48030">tetrapeptides</z:chebi> of p21KB-ras (CVIM), p21N-ras (CVVM), and p21KA-ras (CIIM), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Replacing methionine at the X position with negatively charged <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> reduces its ability to inhibit the enzyme, whereas positively charged lysine at this position abolishes the inhibitory character of the peptidomimetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A hydrophobic moiety at the X position, as in Cys-AMBA-Phe, retains potent inhibitory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Leucine in the X position of CA1A2X is a post-translational signal for protein geranylgeranylation rather than farnesylation, and, as expected, Cys-AMBA-Leu does not inhibit the enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CVIM, CVVM, and CIIM are farnesylated by human p21ras farnesyltransferases and inhibit these enzymes by serving as alternative substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the peptidomimetics described here are true p21ras farnesyltransferase inhibitors since none is farnesylated by this enzyme </plain></SENT>
