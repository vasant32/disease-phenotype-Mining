<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and IL-10 expression was detected in a majority of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens tested, IL-6 expression was detected in 5 of 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that also expressed IL-6R, suggestive of an autocrine mechanism of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples described as mixed immunophenotype contained large numbers of infiltrating T lymphocytes and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoperoxidase staining of a representative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> of mixed immunophenotype demonstrated the presence of HIV-infected macrophages that also stained with anti-IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that IL-6 produced by nonlymphoid cells may act as a paracrine growth factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells that express IL-6R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although earlier studies of AIDs burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines suggested that IL-10 expression required <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, 7 of 12 AIDS LCLs that expressed IL-10 did so in the absence of EBV by EBER in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> LCLs frequently express cell surface CD5, we speculate that IL-10 may act as an autocrine or paracrine growth factor for this class of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that IL-6 and IL-10 are involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated large cell and mixed immunophenotype <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
