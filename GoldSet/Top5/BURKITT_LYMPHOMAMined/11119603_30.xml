<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transporter associated with antigen processing 2 (Tap-2) is responsible for ATP-dependent transport of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum, where <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> bind to newly synthesized human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules, which are essential for cellular immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) has been shown to induce the expression of Tap-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the induction of endogenous Tap-2 by LMP-1 is shown to be associated with and requires the expression of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In DG75 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells, in which LMP-1 induces the expression of IRF-7, LMP-1 induced endogenous Tap-2, and ectopic expression of IRF-7 could enhance the induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Akata <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, in which LMP-1 could not induce IRF-7, LMP-1 could not induce Tap-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Addition of IRF-7, which complements the defect in Akata cells, could stimulate the expression of Tap-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, LMP-1 and IRF-7A but not other IRF-7 splicing variants could activate endogenous Tap-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A Tap-2 promoter reporter construct could be activated by the overexpression of IRF-7A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The activation could be specifically enhanced by LMP-1 and was dependent on an intact interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) present in the Tap-2 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, IRF-7 can bind to the Tap-2 promoter under physiological conditions in vivo, as shown by <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi> cross-linking, as well as to the Tap-2 ISRE in vitro, as shown by gel mobility shift assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, LMP-1 facilitates the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data point to the role of IRF-7 as a secondary mediator of LMP-1-activated signal transduction for Tap-2 as follows: LMP-1 stimulates the expression of IRF-7 and facilitates its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and then the activated IRF-7 mediates the activation of the cellular Tap-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The induction of Tap-2 by IRF-7 and LMP-1 may have an important implication for the immune response to EBV and its persistence in vivo </plain></SENT>
