<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 1988, we experimented with the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method for immunophenotyping of leukaemic cells in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>48 cases of peroxidase-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study showed that 2 peroxidase-negative cases carried myeloid surface markers, 44% were negative for the markers studied and 5% were unclassified due to technical problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the APAAP method is a useful technique for demonstrating cell markers in leukaemic cells as the reaction is reddish and usually intense </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We failed to demonstrate surface markers in 44% of the cases probably because of the choice of a limited panel of monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
