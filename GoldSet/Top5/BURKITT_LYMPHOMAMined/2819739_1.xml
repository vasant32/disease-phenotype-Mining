<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A comparative study of Raji-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> and the parental sensitive Raji cell lines revealed the following: (1) The DNA of Raji-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> cells was crosslinked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi> to a lower extent than Raji DNA; (2) once interstrand crosslinks were formed, they were repaired at the same rate in both cell lines; (3) DNA crosslink formation in Raji-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi>, but not in Raji cells, was enhanced by novobiocin, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitor</z:chebi>; (4) Raji-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> cells had elevated topoisomerase II activity and were hypersensitive to topoisomerase inhibitors (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2687">amsacrine</z:chebi>, novobiocin, teniposide); (5) similar amounts of topoisomerase I were found in both cell lines; and (6) the chromatin of Raji-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> but not of Raji cells, was hypersensitive to DNase I digestion </plain></SENT>
