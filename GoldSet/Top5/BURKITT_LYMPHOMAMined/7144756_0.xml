<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Translation and immunoprecipitation were used to identify <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNAs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>) coding for surface antigens expressed on human lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were extracted from several human lymphoid cell lines as well as from fibroblastoid lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were translated in vitro, and the translation products were reacted with xenoantisera raised against the antigens on human lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Products immunoprecipitated by these antisera were analysed by electrophoresis and fluorography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four antisera immunoprecipitated a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> with a mol. wt (MW) of approximately 32,000 (p32) from translations programmed with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> extracted from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two antisera immunoprecipitated, in addition to p32, another <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> with a MW of approximately 25,000 (p25) only from translations programmed with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from lymphoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p25 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the different lymphoid cell lines fell into three basic abundance classes as determined by in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cells from two Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (Raji and Daudi) did not express detectable p25 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two T-lymphoblastoid lines (Molt-4 and 1301) contained five- to 10-fold less p25 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> than the B-lymphoid cell lines (Victor, RPMI-8866, RPMI-6410, RPMI-8226 and RPMI-1788) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both p32 and p25 were expressed on the cell surface inasmuch as lymphoblastoid cells adsorbed antibodies to both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Human fibroblast, Raji or Daudi cells adsorbed anti-p32 antibodies from the antiserum but not anti-p25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Quantitative absorptions of the antiserum with T- or B-lymphoblastoid cells was used to determine the relative amounts of p32 and p25 expressed on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>B-lymphoblastoid cells were found to express two- to five-fold more p25 on the cell surface then T-lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>p25 does not represent an immunoglobulin light-chain precursor inasmuch as a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled human Ig did not compete with p25 translated in vitro for binding by its respective antibody </plain></SENT>
