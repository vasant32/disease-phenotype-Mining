<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently the human counterparts of the retroviral oncogenes v-myc and v-mos have been mapped to chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have, therefore, analyzed the level of transcription of the cellular myc and mos genes in a variety of undifferentiated B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of Burkitt and non-Burkitt type that possess either an 8;14 or an 8;22 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These lines expressed 2- to 5-fold more myc-specific <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> than do B cell lines without a translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cell lines of American origin with an 8;14 or 8;22 translocation expressed similar amounts of myc-specific <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cell lines of African origin contained slightly higher levels of myc-specific <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> than did those of American origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, level of expression does not appear to correlate with the presence or absence of Epstein-Barr virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a major increase in the transcription of this gene secondary to translocation is unlikely to be the cause of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of mos-related transcripts in any of the cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
