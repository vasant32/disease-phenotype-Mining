<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5686">heterocyclic compounds</z:chebi>, mycalamide-A and -B and onnamide, were isolated from Mycale sp. and Theonella sp. sponges collected in New Zealand and Okinawan waters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each exhibited potent in vitro toxicity and in vivo efficacy against murine and human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of each that inhibited replication of cultured murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> P388 cells by 50% were 5 nM or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mycalamide-A and -B were also potent inhibitors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60, HT-29, and A549 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell replication (50% inhibitory concentration less than 5 nM), while values for onnamide were greater (50% inhibitory concentrations between 25 and 200 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mycalamide-A (10 micrograms/kg) and -B (2.5 micrograms/kg) were moderately active against P388 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (increase in life span, approximately 50%), while onnamide was inactive (40 micrograms/kg; increase in life span, 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mycalamide-A was also active against B16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, Lewis <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinoma</z:mp>, M5076 ovarian <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, colon 26 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and the human MX-1, CX-1, and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mechanism of action studies indicate that the three agents inhibited protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For example, after 1-h exposures to 20 nM mycalamide-A and -B, the rates of [3H]leucine incorporation into acid-precipitable material of cultured P388 cells were inhibited 54 and 99%, while the effects on incorporation of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> and [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> were less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative effects of 20 to 2000 nM mycalamide-A on protein, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, and DNA synthesis were consistent with those observed during exposure of P388 cells to 1 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4781">emetine</z:chebi>, a known inhibitor of protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, the three agents inhibited translation of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> into protein in a cell-free lysate of rabbit reticulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although mycalamide-A disrupted DNA metabolism, the agent apparently did not intercalate into DNA, and a mixture of four deoxynucleosides (250 microM each) did not decrease the antiproliferative effects of the agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data indicate that this class of compounds represents novel antitumor agents which should be further evaluated to define their potential </plain></SENT>
