<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The c-Myc protein is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> though heterodimerization with Max to form a transcriptionally active sequence-specific DNA binding complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By means of sequential immunoprecipitation of chromatin using anti-Max and anti-Myc antibodies, we have identified a Myc-regulated gene and genomic sites occupied by Myc-Max in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four of 27 sites recovered by this procedure corresponded to the highest affinity 'canonical' CACGTG sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the most common in vivo binding sites belonged to the group of 'non-canonical' E box-related binding sites previously identified by in vitro selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several of the genomic fragments isolated contained transcribed sequences, including one, MrDb, encoding an evolutionarily conserved <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> helicase of the DEAD box family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The corresponding <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was induced following activation of a Myc-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor fusion protein (Myc-ER) in the presence of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48001">protein synthesis inhibitor</z:chebi>, consistent with this helicase gene being a direct target of Myc-Max </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, as for c-Myc, the expression of MrDb is induced upon proliferative stimulation of primary human fibroblasts as well as B cells and down-regulated during terminal differentiation of HL60 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that Myc-Max heterodimers interact in vivo with a specific set of E box-related DNA sequences and that Myc is likely to activate multiple target genes including a highly conserved DEAD box protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Myc may exert its effects on cell behavior through proteins that affect <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> structure and metabolism </plain></SENT>
