<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A translocation resulting in a fusion of ETV6 (<z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>) gene at 12p13 and CBFA2 (AML1) gene at 21q22 is variably reported in 16-36% of cases of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This t(12;21)(p13;q22) is not detectable by conventional cytogenetic methods and was reported to be associated with B-cell precursor ALL with presumed favorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined 18 cases of well characterized childhood B-cell precursor ALL with cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, and clinical data for the presence of the t(12;21) using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the 18 cases (78%) were positive for fusion ETV6/CBFA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALL</z:e> patients was positive (12% of cells positive in this 21 year old patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, no evidence of t(12;21) by FISH was noted in two childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> cases and 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the 14 positive childhood cases had CD13 and/or CD33 expression (myeloid markers) while only one of the four negative cases was CD13 and CD33 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight of 12 cases positive for t(12;21), and with conventional cytogenetic data, had structural and/or numerical chromosome abnormalities other than the detected t(12;21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One case had relapse with gradual increase in percentage of cells positive for t(12;21) and development of an isochromosome 21 carrying the fusion signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data reveal a strong association of t(12;21) with B-cell precursor ALL, especially with myeloid marker expression </plain></SENT>
