<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present work supported and extended a previous study (used VLIg gene segment type VkappaIV) and indicated that a considerable (P&lt;0.001) and specific autologous T-cell proliferation, proliferative index (PI) ranged from 386.0 to 399.5 at 20% dendritic cells (DCs):T-cells ratio, restricted mainly (&gt;80%) to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I molecules can be elicited in vitro against other different VLg gene segments (VkappaI, VkappaIII and Vlambda2) of <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines through a retroviral transduction of human DCs generated from CD34+ progenitor cells by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) and under serum-free conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study also showed a lesser proliferation, but significant (P&lt;0.05), restricted to MHC class-II molecules and specific for VLIg gene segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The obtained proliferation was almost completely blocked (approximately 95%, P&lt;0.001) by anti-CD86 monoclonal antibodies, which confirmed the critical role of the CD86 costimulatory molecules in the activation of naive T-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resulting immune responses did not significantly differ (P&gt;0.05) among the different types of VLIg gene segments, as VLIg-transduced DCs equally coexpressed the VLIg genes and CD86 costimulatory molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study could provide the basis of a VLIg-based immunotherapy in plasma cell and B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
