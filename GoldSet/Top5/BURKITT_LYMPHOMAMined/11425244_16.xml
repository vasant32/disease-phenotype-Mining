<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drug 5'-azacytidine (AZC) has been used as demethylating agent to induce the expression of previously silencing genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we attempted to determine, using proteomics, the changes in protein expression profiles following a treatment of an Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell line DG 75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of the treatment in terms of cell viability and growth were first examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following observations were made: AZC treatment led to (i) a decrease in cell growth with an arrest of the cell at G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, (ii) the expression of p16, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene whose expression was dependent on its promoter demethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proteomic study evidenced that AZC treatment affected protein expression in two different ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were down-expressed, while 14 showed an increased expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some of the upregulated proteins appeared related to the energy metabolism, to organization of cytoskeletal structures, and to cell viability and protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also established a reference map for proteins in DG 75 cell line, comprising 74 different <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> corresponding to 67 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This map will be accessible via Internet as a resource for proteome analyses of B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the results presented here highlight new insights into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell gene regulations following a treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with AZC and illustrate a use of proteomics to evidence the direct and indirect effects of a drug and the pathways it possibly regulates </plain></SENT>
