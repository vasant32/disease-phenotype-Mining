<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although increased expression of the HMG-I/Y proteins is associated with cellular proliferation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e>, and several human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, the role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To better understand the role of these proteins in cell growth and transformation, we have been studying the regulation and function of HMG-I/Y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HMG-I/Y promoter was cloned, sequenced, and subjected to mutagenesis analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A c-Myc-Max consensus DNA binding site was identified as an element important in the serum stimulation of HMG-I/Y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The oncoprotein c-Myc and its protein partner Max bind to this site in vitro and activate transcription in transfection experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HMG-I/Y expression is stimulated by c-Myc in a Myc-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> receptor cell line in the presence of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48001">protein synthesis inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi>, indicating that HMG-I/Y is a direct c-Myc target gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HMG-I/Y induction is decreased in Myc-deficient fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HMG-I/Y protein expression is also increased in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, which are known to have increased c-Myc protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Like Myc, increased expression of HMG-I protein leads to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> of both Rat 1a fibroblasts and CB33 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, Rat 1a cells overexpressing HMG-I protein form <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Decreasing HMG-I/Y proteins using an antisense construct abrogates transformation in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that HMG-I/Y is a c-Myc target gene involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> and a member of a new class of potential oncogenes </plain></SENT>
