<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> aerobic glycolysis was recognized about seven decades ago; however, its molecular basis has remained elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase-A gene (LDH-A), whose product participates in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> anaerobic glycolysis and is frequently increased in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, was identified as a c-Myc-responsive gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stably transfected Rat1a fibroblasts that overexpress LDH-A alone or those transformed by c-Myc overproduce <z:chebi fb="22" ids="28358">lactic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LDH-A overexpression is required for c-Myc-mediated transformation because lowering its level through antisense LDH-A expression reduces soft agar clonogenicity of c-Myc-transformed Rat1a fibroblasts, c-Myc-transformed human lymphoblastoid cells, and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although antisense expression of LDH-A did not affect the growth of c-Myc-transformed fibroblasts adherent to culture dishes under normoxic conditions, the growth of these adherent cells in <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that an increased LDH-A level is required for the growth of a transformed spheroid cell mass, which has a hypoxic internal microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our studies have linked c-Myc to the induction of LDH-A, whose expression increases <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> production and is necessary for c-Myc-mediated transformation </plain></SENT>
