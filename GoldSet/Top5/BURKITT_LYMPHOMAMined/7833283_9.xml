<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impairment of the immune system by immunosuppressive drugs is the assumed cause of PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is detected in most of the PTLD studied and is considered as the main aetiological agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of PTLD patients remains unpredictable, some lymphoproliferations regress after discontinuation of the immunosuppressive treatment, others behave as true <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which a viro-induced lymphoproliferation evolves to an autonomous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> remains unclear, and little is known about the genetic changes that occur during this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of fatal EBV-associated PTLD in heart transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were monoclonal and carried numerous chromosomal abnormalities, including a classic t(8;14)(q24;q32) with rearrangement of the MYC proto-oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> demonstrated an amplification of the proto-oncogene N-MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The EBNA2 gene was not expressed in tumoral cells, suggesting that the chromosomal abnormalities contributed the function of EBNA2 in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> indicated that the cases presented here were not Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings provide some clues with regard to the genetic changes which lead to a B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in some transplant patients </plain></SENT>
