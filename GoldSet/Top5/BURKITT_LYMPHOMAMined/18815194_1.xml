<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated that patients with childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> presenting with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> at diagnosis have an increased risk of poor outcome compared to patients with more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has not been reported whether there is any correlation between degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: In a cohort of 1162 patients with childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> we analyzed whether there was a correlation between degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also studied the association between degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and event-free survival within the subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels at diagnosis were distributed in a non-random pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was significantly different for three distinct groups of patients compared to the remaining patients (mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>; T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>: 106 g/L versus 76 g/L (precursor B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>); within precursor B-cell ALL: <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 positive: 68 g/L versus 79 g/L; BCR-ABL positive: 93 g/L versus 76 g/L; each p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in contrast to the entire study group, patients with T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1(+), and BCR-ABL(+) precursor B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> had a more favorable prognosis if presenting with a higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level (&gt;/=80 g/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These observations indicate that the formerly reported direct correlation between severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and survival in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> mainly reflects differences in the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> between distinct biological subgroups with different treatment outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the inverse relationship between severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and survival found within specific subgroups suggests that very low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels at diagnosis are associated with more advanced disease in these subgroups </plain></SENT>
