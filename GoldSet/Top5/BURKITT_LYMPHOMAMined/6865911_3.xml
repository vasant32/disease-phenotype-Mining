<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The compounds strongly inhibited the incorporation of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> into DNA at agent concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, at subinhibitory concentrations, slightly enhancing or synergistic effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that immune cell behavior can be bidirectionally influenced by the presence of metal-complexing agents, depending on their concentration in the medium </plain></SENT>
