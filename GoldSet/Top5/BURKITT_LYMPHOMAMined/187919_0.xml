<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both tests, autologous serum from some <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects was shown to confer strong reactivity on weak or non-responder cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reactivity to purified protein derivative of tuberculin (<z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi>) assessed in parallel was shown to be unaffected by autologous serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Employing the LAI system, variations in the effects of autologous serum samples collected on consecutive days was shown to be dependent on the reactivity of the leukocytes themselves, rather than changes in the activity or concentration of factors present in the serum </plain></SENT>
