<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic activator genes bzlf1 and brlf1 are conventionally referred to as immediate-early (IE) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, previous studies showed that the earliest expression of these genes was blocked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> when the EBV lytic cycle was induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and protein kinase C <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-IgG activates a complex signal transduction pathway that leads to EBV lytic activation in the Akata cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that in Akata cells, where lytic cycle activation occurs very rapidly after anti-IgG treatment, de novo protein synthesis is also required for induction of bzlf1 and brlf1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>New protein synthesis is required up to 1.25 h after application of anti-IgG; bzlf1 and brlf1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> can be detected 1.5 h after anti-IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five cellular IE genes were shown to be expressed by 1 h after addition of anti-IgG, and their expression preceded that of bzlf1 and brlf1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These include early growth response genes (egr1, egr2, and egr3) and nuclear orphan receptors (nr4a1 and nr4a3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These genes were activated by anti-IgG treatment of Akata cells with and without the EBV genome; therefore, their expression was not dependent on expression of any EBV gene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EGR1, EGR2, and EGR3 proteins were kinetically upstream of ZEBRA and Rta proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of EGR1, ZEBRA, and Rta proteins were inhibited by bisindolylmaleimide X, a selective inhibitor of PKC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest a revised model in which the signal transduction cascade activated by cross-linking of the B cell receptor induces expression of cellular IE genes, such as early growth response and nuclear orphan receptor genes, whose products, in turn, regulate bzlf1 and brlf1 expression </plain></SENT>
