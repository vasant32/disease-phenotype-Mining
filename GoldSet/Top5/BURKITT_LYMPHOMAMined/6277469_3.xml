<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By means of "mesome-prosome" analysis of the G-band patterns of these markers; it was established that the additional chromosome segments of these two 14q+ markers came from chromosomes #3 and #5, respectively, and not from chromosome #8 as in the 14q+ marker of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosome #8 was not involved at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in any changes in the ten lymphoblastoid cell lines studied </plain></SENT>
