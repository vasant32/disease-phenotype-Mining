<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>67Cu has excellent physical and biochemical properties for radioimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>67Cu-2IT-BAT-Lym-1 has been used in preclinical and clinical trials, where an exceptionally long residence time of 67Cu on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BCL-2, a proto-oncogene that promotes cell survival by blocking apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, is overexpressed in most B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> including Raji human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, therapeutic efficacy and BCL-2 gene and protein expression levels were examined in Raji xenografts in mice after 67Cu-2IT-BAT-Lym-1 radioimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>67Cu-2IT-BAT-Lym-1 therapy induced a response rate (complete and partial responses) of approximately 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BCL-2 gene expression was decreased 3 h after radioimmunotherapy, followed by a decrease in Bcl-2 protein by 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decreases in BCL-2 gene and protein expression preceding observations of 67Cu-2IT-BAT-Lym-1 therapeutic effect suggest that down-regulation of BCL-2 leaves cells more likely to be killed by low dose-rate radiation from radioimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
