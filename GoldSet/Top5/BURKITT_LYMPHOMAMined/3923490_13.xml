<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine which of these two possibilities is correct, we hybridized Chinese hamster fibroblasts with J558 mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> cells that carry a reciprocal chromosome translocation between chromosomes 12 and 15, and we examined the segregating hybrids for the presence of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and rearranged mouse c-myc genes, for the presence of different regions of the mouse heavy chain locus, and for the presence of genes located on mouse chromosomes 12 and 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of this analysis indicate that, as in human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with the 8;14 chromosome translocation, the c-myc gene is translocated to the heavy chain locus in mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus the orientation of the heavy chain locus on mouse chromosome 12 and of the c-myc gene on mouse chromosome 15 is the same as the orientation of the homologous loci in man </plain></SENT>
