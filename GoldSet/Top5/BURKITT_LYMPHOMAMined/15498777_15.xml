<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An EBV genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that EBNA1 constantly binds to oriP of the EBV genome during not only latent but also lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the total levels of EBNA1 proved constant throughout the latter, the levels of the oriP-bound form were increased as lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> proceeded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBV productive DNA replication occurs at discrete sites in nuclei, called replication compartments, where <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication proteins are clustered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Confocal laser microscopic analyses revealed that whereas EBNA1 was distributed broadly in nuclei as fine punctate dots during the latent phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, the protein became redistributed to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication compartments and localized as distinct spots within and/or nearby the compartments after the induction of lytic replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taking these findings into consideration, oriP regions of the EBV genome might be organized by EBNA1 into replication domains that may set up scaffolding for lytic replication and transcription </plain></SENT>
