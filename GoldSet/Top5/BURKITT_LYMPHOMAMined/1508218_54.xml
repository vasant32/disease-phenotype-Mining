<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated whether human lymphoid cells are able to synthesize and secrete human PRL (hPRL) and to express PRL receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Metabolic labeling with [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]methionine and immunoprecipitation of cell extracts from human mononuclear cells (MNC) and a human T lymphocyte cell line with an antiserum against hPRL revealed protein of M(r) 23,000, identical in size to pituitary hPRL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dilution curves of lymphocyte immunoreactive hPRL were parallel to those obtained with pituitary hPRL in an immunoradiometric assay using two monoclonal antibodies against hPRL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction experiments with primers located in the coding sequence of hPRL showed that the hPRL gene was expressed in MNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cDNA cloning and sequence analysis indicated the presence of an extra 5' noncoding exon previously described for decidual hPRL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When MNCs were further separated into B cells, T cells, and monocytes, the expression of hPRL appeared to be mainly associated with the T lymphocyte fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hPRL transcript was also detected in thymocytes and in a set of human lymphoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, polymerase chain reaction experiments revealed a ubiquitous distribution of PRL receptor gene expression in B cells, T cells, and monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of the receptor for PRL and production of PRL by T lymphocytes suggest a possible autocrine or paracrine effect of PRL in immune cell function </plain></SENT>
