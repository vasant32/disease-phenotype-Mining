<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report herein a case of blastoid variant mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) with both aberrant phenotype and unusual genetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were CD5(-) and CD10(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standard karyotype and FISH techniques showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells carried two distinct translocations which had not been reported together in a same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first translocation juxtaposed the immunoglobulin lambda light chain locus with CCND1 locus, leading to Cyclin D1 overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second translocation revealed MYC rearrangement with a non-immunoglobulin gene partner located on the short arm of chromosome 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interpretation of the case on tissue sections alone could have been challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the lack of CD5 and expression of CD10 associated with MYC rearrangement detected on interphasic nuclei could support the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This distinction is also especially important as these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes require specific treatment </plain></SENT>
