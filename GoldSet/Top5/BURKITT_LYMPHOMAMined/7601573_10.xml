<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the molecular basis of such down-regulation by comparing 5 pairs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) derived from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells of the same individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of apparently intact HLA AII genes was confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 BL/LCL pairs by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) typing and by Southern-blot hybridization with HLA A locus-specific probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Northern-blot analysis with locus- and allele-specific probes revealed a significantly lower expression or absence of AII-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 BL lines compared to the corresponding LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of AII-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was achieved by IFN alpha treatment of 2 BL lines with low HLA AII expression (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-28 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-72) while the treatment had no effect in 3 BL lines (WWI-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, WW2-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and BL41) that did not express the endogenous gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HLA AII expression was restored by transfection of the gene in WWI-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> whereas transfectants of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-41 remained AII-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An HLA-AII-promoter-driven <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> transferase reporter gene (pAIICAT) was active in WWI-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HLA-AII was expressed in hybrids of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-41 with an AII-positive LCL, while expression of the endogenous HLA AII gene could not be restored by fusion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-41 with an AII-negative LCL, although an adequate set of transcription factors was present in the hybrid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that genetic defects and lack of transcription factors may contribute to the selective down-regulation of HLA AII in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
