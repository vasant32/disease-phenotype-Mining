<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> and is associated with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Like <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> herpesviruses, the EBV life cycle alternates between latency and lytic replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During latency, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome is largely silenced by host-driven methylation of CpG motifs and, in the switch to the lytic cycle, this epigenetic silencing is overturned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A key event is the activation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> BRLF1 gene by the immediate-early protein Zta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Zta is a bZIP transcription factor that preferentially binds to specific response elements (ZREs) in the BRLF1 promoter (Rp) when these elements are methylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Zta's ability to trigger lytic cycle activation is severely compromised when a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residue</z:chebi> in its bZIP domain is mutated to serine (C189S), but the molecular basis for this effect is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the C189S mutant is defective for activating Rp in a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutant is compromised both in vitro and in vivo for binding two methylated ZREs in Rp (ZRE2 and ZRE3), although the effect is striking only for ZRE3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular modeling of Zta bound to methylated ZRE3, together with biochemical data, indicate that C189 directly contacts one of the two <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosines</z:chebi> within a specific CpG motif </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The motif's second <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> (on the complementary DNA strand) is predicted to contact S186, a residue known to regulate <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-ZRE recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that C189 regulates the enhanced interaction of Zta with methylated DNA in overturning the epigenetic control of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As C189 is conserved in many bZIP proteins, the selectivity of Zta for methylated DNA may be a paradigm for a more general phenomenon </plain></SENT>
