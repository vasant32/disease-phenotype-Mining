<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sequential administration of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitor</z:chebi> followed by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50276">topoisomerase I inhibitor</z:chebi> is potentially synergistic due to increased target enzyme levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) were eligible for this phase II study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> 25 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) on day 1 and topotecan 1.75 mg/m2/day IV on days 3 - 5, every 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The trial objectives included the overall response rate, progression-free survival, and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients were enrolled and 25 patients are assessable for toxicity and response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age was 58 (range 23 - 74) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients had received a median of two (range one to five) prior regimens, including five patients with a prior stem cell transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients (20%, 95% confidence interval 0.07, 0.42) responded with two (8%) complete remissions and three (12%) partial remissions; an additional four (16%) patients had stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both patients achieving a complete remission had Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and topotecan is well tolerated and has modest activity in relapsed/refractory NHL, with occasional patients having a prolonged remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The activity in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should be investigated further </plain></SENT>
