<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-six fluids from 98 patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have been examined cytologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall accuracy was 88 per cent with only one false positive in 126 fluids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>False negatives were highest in the cerebrospinal fluid, which may reflect poor exfoliation of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells when the leptomeninges are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have found exfoliative cytology to be an accurate method of diagnosing lymphomatous involvement of the leptomeninges, pleura and peritoneum and when a cytologic diagnosis of involvement by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is made it is almost as accurate as a histologic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear characteristics and selected histochemical methods will allow classification of many types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in bytologic preparations </plain></SENT>
