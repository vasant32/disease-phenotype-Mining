<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Raji cells were induced by <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Simultaneity, the Raji cells were inhibited to adhere on culture flask by polyHEME </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell viability was detected by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> method and the cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> percentage was estimated by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DAPK and focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> kinase (FAK) expression were measured by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coding sequence on the C-terminal of DAPK, which can suppress the function of DAPK, was transfected into the Raji cells to investigate whether the C-terminal of DAPK could inhibit the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Raji cells induced by <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After being treated with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, the Raji cells expressed DAPK and displayed many protrusions to adhere onto the culture flask </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Raji cells were susceptible to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> when they were inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> by polyHEME </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At that time, the cell viability decreased, the cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> percentage increased and the protein levels of total FAK were reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Raji cells, which were transfected with the coding region on the C-terminal of DAPK, sustained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the FAK protein level when treated with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> induced DAPK expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It caused the Raji cells to display many protrusions <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> around the cells and adhere onto the culture flask </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DAPK expression prompted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by reducing the FAK protein level in <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>-induced Raji cells </plain></SENT>
