<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The development of immunotherapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> has been observed in the last few years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the approaches is the use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> vaccines based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-derived dendritic cells (DC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies from our laboratory and other laboratories have shown that CD40 stimulation improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells immunogenicity and generates an antitumor immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The design of future <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> vaccines requires the knowledge concerning the function of dendritic cells including antigen processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of our present study was the assessment of antigen-processing machinery (APM) components in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cells before and after CD40 stimulation at <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five children with ALL were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leukemic cells were stimulated (or not) with CD40L and IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elements of the antigen-processing machinery (MB1, LMP2, LMP7, LMP10, TAP1, TAP2, calnexin, calreticulin, tapasin, ERp57, zeta, delta) were determined by real-time PCR technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of important costimulatory and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules considered as DC markers (CD40, CD54, CD80, CD83, CD86) were determined at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (PCR) and protein (flow cytometry) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The following are the results of our study: (1) We noted an upregulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> costimulatory and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in ALL cells after the culture; (2) the significant rise in expression of nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> APM components after CD40 stimulation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This confirms specific stimulation of the antigen-processing system in ALL cells by CD40L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future work should focus on the clinical significance of these findings for immunotherapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
