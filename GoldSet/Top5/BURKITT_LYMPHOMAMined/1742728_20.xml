<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We surveyed 11 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines for chemosensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi>) in order to determine whether any simple correlates to cytotoxic response might be revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lines tested varied over a 5-fold range in concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> required to inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell growth by 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Drug sensitivity correlated neither with continental origin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, growth fraction, presence of Epstein-Barr virus, nor with the precise locations of (8;14) translocation breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, contrary to experience with other cell lines, no simple correlation was found between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> sensitivity of the four most divergent lines (low sensitivity, CA46 and MC116 cells; high sensitivity, Namalwa and JLP119 cells) and exposure to DNA cross-links (area under the DNA cross-linking-versus-time curve) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found similar extents of gene-specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi>-induced damage in the native and translocated c-myc alleles of CA46 and JLP119 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At equimolar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> treatment, CA46 cells exhibited a profound arrest in G2M phase, while JLP119 cells exhibited prolonged S-phase delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggested that despite similar DNA cross-link exposure, JLP119 cells were less able to complete DNA replication while repair was in progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As cell cycle distribution returned to near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, JLP119 cells exhibited DNA degradation characterized by oligonucleosome-sized DNA fragments prior to cell membrane disintegration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi>-sensitive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells may be more susceptible to delay in S phase for a given frequency of DNA cross-links and that prolongation of S phase correlated with apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
