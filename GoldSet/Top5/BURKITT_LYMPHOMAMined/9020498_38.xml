<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Incidence data of childhood <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (CL) in Hong Kong (1984-90) have been analysed for evidence of variation between small areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases (n=261) were classified by morphological cell type, with the majority (n=205) being <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL), and haematological review has permitted immunophenotypic classification for 73% of these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data have been examined for evidence of spatial clustering within small census areas (TPUs) and for association with population mixing, with attention focused on those subgroups (especially the childhood peak of ALL--taken here to be diagnoses in children from 24 months up to the seventh birthday--and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e>) which, it has been hypothesized, may be caused by unusual patterns of exposure and response to common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the whole of Hong Kong, there was evidence of spatial clustering of ALL at ages 0-4 years (P = 0.09) and in the childhood peak (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When these analyses were restricted to TPUs where extreme population mixing may have occurred, overall incidence was elevated and significant evidence of clustering was found for ALL (P&lt;0.007) at these ages and for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> in the childhood peak (P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Replication of the analyses for subsets of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> that were not dominated by the childhood peak of ALL found no evidence of clustering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first investigation of an association between population mixing and childhood <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in Asia and the first to include clustering and to consider particular subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results are supportive of the 'infectious' aetiology hypothesis for subsets of childhood <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, specifically <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> in the childhood peak </plain></SENT>
