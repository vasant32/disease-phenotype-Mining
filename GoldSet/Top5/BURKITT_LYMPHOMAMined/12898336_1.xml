<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nuclear lamins, components of the nuclear lamina, have also been found in the nucleoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here that EBNA-1 coincided with lamin B1 in the nucleoplasm and around the nuclear rim during S-phase by confocal microscopy of cells transfected with EBNA-1 in the absence of EBV plasmids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lamin B1, which is rarely detected in nuclear soluble fractions, was detected in chromatin and nuclear matrix fractions of the EBNA-1-expressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that EBNA-1 colocalizes with lamin B1 in the subnuclear sites </plain></SENT>
