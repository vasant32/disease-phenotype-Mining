<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study we compare the binding and immune stimulatory properties of BAT and anti CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both antibodies were previously shown to manifest effective immune responses against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have described that BAT antibody, produced against Daudi, a B lymphoblastoid cell line, binds and activates T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper we demonstrate that anti CTLA-4, produced against the T-cell activation determinant CTLA-4, binds also to B lymphoblastoid cell lines like Daudi and Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both antibodies do not bind resting B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BAT binds resting T lymphocytes as well as activated T lymphocytes, whereas anti CTLA-4 binds only activated T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Competitive binding experiments indicate that the binding sites of BAT and anti CTLA-4 on activated T cells are distinct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have studied the in vitro stimulatory effect of BAT and anti CTLA-4 on lymphocytes cultured with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to BAT that increased the proliferation of lymphocytes that have been cultured with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, anti CTLA-4 did not synergize with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells to enhance lymphocyte proliferation </plain></SENT>
