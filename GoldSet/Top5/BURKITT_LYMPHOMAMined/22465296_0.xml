<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we previously documented <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a B non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line involving diacylglycerol analogue stimulation of Ras guanyl-releasing protein, a Ras activator, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi>, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further explore the role of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi>, we examined several <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi>-deficient B non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells for their responses to pico, a synthetic bryostatin-1-like compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi>(-) mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines Jeko-1, Mino, Sp53, UPN1, and Z138 and the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi>(+) cell line Rec-1, as well as the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells lines BL2 (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi>(-)) and Daudi (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi>(+)), were examined for their response to pico using assays for proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as well as biochemical methods for Ras guanyl-releasing proteins and Bcl-2 family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the exception of UPN1, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines underwent pico-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, as did BL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In some cases, hallmarks of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were substantially diminished in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pico treatment generally led to increased expression of proapoptotic Bik, although the absolute levels of Bik varied considerably between cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A pico-resistant variant of Z138 exhibited decreased Bik induction compared to parental Z138 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pico also generally decreased expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL and Mcl1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although, these changes in Bcl-2 family members seem unlikely to fully account for the differential behavior of the cell lines, our demonstration of a potent apoptotic process in most cell lines derived from mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> encourages a re-examination of diacylglycerol analogues in the treatment of this subset of B non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
