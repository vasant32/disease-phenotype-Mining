<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> resistance has been known in various kinds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of individualized chemotherapy according to different drug metabolism in different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients, the treatment became more reasonable and scientific and the treatment effect has been gradually improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there was few report about its drug resistance mechanism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to establish Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> resistant cell strain--Namlwa 12/MTX and study its resistant mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Namlwa 12/MTX resistant cell strain was established by repeated impulsed exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> effect on Namlwa 12/MTX and Namlwa cell strains were evaluated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23743">dihydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (DHFR) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was assayed with RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The function of the reduced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> carrier (RFC) were tested with 3H-MTX labeling and counted with beta-liquid scintillation counter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The capacity to form the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53376">polyglutamate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTXPG) in these cell strains was assayed with 3H-MTX labeling and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: More than 20 times <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> resistance was found in Namalwa 12/MTX cell strain in comparison with the Namalwa cell strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This resistance was not associated with the dysfunction of the RFC, but was closely associated with the amount of MTXPG formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The amount of total MTXPG (MTXPG1-6) formed in these 2 cell strains was (1583 +/- 26) pmol/10(9) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and (4453 +/- 236) pmol/10(9) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, respectively (P &lt; 0.05), while the amount of long chain MTXPG (MTXPG4-6) formed only accounted for 5.5% and 25.4% of the MTXPG1-6, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The level of DHFR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was gradually increased with the formation of the drug resistance in Namalwa 12/MTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Synthesizing difficulty of MTXPG and over-expression of DHFR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level result in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> resistance in Namalwa 12/MTX cell strain </plain></SENT>
