<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From 1977 to 1982, the authors attempted a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> suppression trial in North Mara District, Tanzania, to see whether the incidence of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) could be lowered by reducing the level of malarial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in a child population below 10 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immediately after initiation of the suppression trial, the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> fell drastically in the Mara children; however, soon after, the rate of malarial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rose again in the trial area in spite of continued <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> distribution, and by 1981 the prevalence of malarial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> again reached the high levels that had prevailed in the North Mara lowlands before 1977 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, during the period of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> distribution in North Mara, the level of malarial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> there was constantly lower than that observed in a comparison area in South Mara, although the two areas had been similar with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> endemicity prior to the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the years of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> distribution in North Mara, the incidence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> there fell considerably, from about 4 per 100,000 population to about 1 per 100,000 population, and it rose again to pretrial levels in 1984, that is, about two years after the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> distribution had been terminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This apparent association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> suppression and decline in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> incidence at first seemed to indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> is a causal factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A close scrutiny of the survey data revealed, however, that the decline in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> incidence might have started several years before the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> distribution began; thus it appears that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> suppression could not have been the sole cause of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> decline </plain></SENT>
