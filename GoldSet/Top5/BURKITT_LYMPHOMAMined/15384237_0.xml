<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 6-year-old male child was consulted in our ambulatory in Goundi missionary hospital in South Chad, in September 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He complained of a long lasting abdominal mass and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>African Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with abdominal "bulky" involvement was strongly suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a little amount of some antiblastic drugs were available, the patient was treated according to CEOP regime as salvage treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A week later no lymph nodes were detectable, spleen and liver enlargement reverted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dimensions and the abdominal mass disappeared almost completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical general conditions improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He was treated with further three cycles of the same therapy with 3 weeks interval with complete clinical remission after the second dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the first four cycles, a consolidating treatment was performed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The child performed other two cycles of therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> remaining in complete remission and then escaped further follow-up visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the good response achieved after the four initial cycles suggests that the CEOP combination could be effective in this kind of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CHOP nor CEOP regime have never been employed in the treatment of African Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This case report suggest the possibility of good responses in more critical or "bulky" Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of this combination </plain></SENT>
