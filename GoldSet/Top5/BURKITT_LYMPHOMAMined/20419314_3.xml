<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A clinical course of patients with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) is aggressive, and the disease is rarely curable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proliferation rate is the most important prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed a novel, reliable, rapid, and routinely applicable approach allowing a precise quantitative assessment of three proliferation markers, Ki-67, topoisomerase IIalpha, and TPX2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 95 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimens were measured in the study by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RQ-RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tested the reproducibility and accuracy of the assay and correlated the results with the immunohistochemical staining of the corresponding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results obtained indicated individual variability of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels, reflecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the proliferation rate in individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, we observed the highest <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the group of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and the lowest in patients with reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found increased proliferation rate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e> with high cyclin D1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, indicating a quantitative control of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed a correlation between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression level and the immunohistochemical staining of corresponding proteins, which significantly argues for the prognostic significance of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression measuring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We confirmed the accuracy of the current assay for a precise quantitative examination of the proliferation activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Real-time RT-PCR provides a novel approach applicable for clinical trials, and it represents a potent approach allowing to stratify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> patients for entry into clinical trials according to the expression of the proliferation signature genes in their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This approach may contribute to improved and individualized therapeutic options respecting the individual progression risk of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
