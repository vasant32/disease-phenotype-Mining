<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These oriP-binding proteins interfere with the EBV-encoded nuclear antigen EBNA-1, which binds to oriP in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further characterize these proteins, a lambda phage expression cDNA library made from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi>-induced BJAB cells was screened for fusion proteins which bind to oriP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two recombinant phages containing sequences encoding beta-galactosidase fusion proteins and designated lambda-OBP-1 and lambda-OBP-2 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>lambda-OBP-1 and lambda-OBP-2 contained 0.43 kbp and 0.61 kbp of BJAB cell cDNA, respectively, of which 395 bp were shared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using lambda-OBP-1 as probe, two cDNAs of 1.4 kbp and 1.2 kbp, designated OBP-1 and OBP-2, respectively, were isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cDNAs also shared the 395-bp sequence at the 3' end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With these cDNAs as probes, Northern blot analyses of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from BJAB cells gave 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4-kb bands, but a Southern blot of human genomic DNA revealed one band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the oriP-binding proteins were derived from spliced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>(s) of a gene family </plain></SENT>
