<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported that the cytokine interferon-alpha (IFNalpha), commonly used in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, induced a caspase-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The signaling mechanisms involved have not been defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that both proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bak and Bax were activated by IFNalpha, strictly in correlation with the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using double stainings, we demonstrated that Bak was activated prior to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi> c) release and caspase-3 activation, whereas activated Bax was only found in cells with released <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi> c, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> depolarization, as well as activated caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IFNalpha-induced activation of Bak, and to a large extent also of Bax, was dependent on caspase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the use of a panel of specific caspase inhibitors we found, however, that none of caspases-1 to -10 were responsible for this activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither was the Ca(2+)-dependent protease calpain nor the stress-activated p38 SAPK pathway significantly involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Bcl-2 blocked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by IFNalpha totally abolished Bak activation, as well as decreased the amount of activated Bax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that IFNalpha induces Bak and Bax activation via distinct mechanisms involving an unknown protease, and that their activation is regulated by Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
