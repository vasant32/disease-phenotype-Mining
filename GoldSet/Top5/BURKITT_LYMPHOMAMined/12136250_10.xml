<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We studied the antitumor activity of 2-amino-4,4alpha-dihydro-4alpha,7-dimethyl-3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25970">phenoxazine</z:chebi>-3-one (Phx), which was synthesized by the reactions of 2-amino-5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25399">methylphenol</z:chebi> with bovine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, on human B cell lymphoblastoid cell lines, P3HR-1 and Raji derived from African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and the human T cell lymphoblastoid cell line Molt-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also studied whether Phx might cause <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated cell viability and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the cells in the presence of Phx, by using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, flow cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Phx suppressed the viability of P3HR-1, Raji, and Molt-4 cells, though the suppression patterns were different, i.e., Phx suppressed the viability of P3HR-1, Raji, and Molt-4 cells at higher concentrations, while the drug enhanced the viability of Raji cells, but not those of P3HR-1 and Molt-4 cells at lower concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate which type of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> - <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> - is induced by Phx, induction of DNA ladder, phosphatidylserine externalization, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi>-permeable cells were examined in Phx-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although Phx did not induce DNA ladder formation, it induced the phosphatidylserine externalization and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi>-permeable cells, suggesting that Phx caused a mixed type of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The population of early stage apoptotic cells was dominant in Raji cells, and that of the late stage apoptotic/necrotic cells was dominant in Molt-4 cells after 72-h treatment with Phx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The population of the early stage apoptotic cells and the late stage apoptotic/necrotic cells was almost equal in P3HR-1 cells in the presence of Phx, though the population of both types of cells increased with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The nuclear morphological analysis of Phx-treated Raji, P3HR-1, and Molt-4 cells also showed that Phx induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that Phx shows antitumor activity against human B cell-derived and T cell-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines, in vitro, causing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
