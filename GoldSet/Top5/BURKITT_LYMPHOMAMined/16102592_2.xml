<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Much evidence suggests that CFSs are causally related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> as breakpoints in recurrent chromosome mutations and as sites of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> integration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the FRA2G <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CFS</z:e> (2q31) for biallelic deletions and loss of expression in a panel of 19 tumor-derived cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell line DAUDI has a biallelic deletion of eight of the nine analyzed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we observed loss of expression (LOE) of the DHRS9 gene (alias RDHL), one of the deleted genes in the DAUDI cell line, in MOLT-14 and Raji cell lines derived from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and from T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DHRS9 is involved in development and differentiation pathways </plain></SENT>
