<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A transfection assay with a lymphoblastoid cell line infected with Epstein-Barr virus was used to compare the abilities of type 1 and type 2 EBNA2 to sustain cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reduced proliferation in cells expressing type 2 EBNA2 correlated with loss of expression of some cell genes that are known to be targets of type 1 EBNA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis of EBNA2 target genes identified a small number of genes that are more strongly induced by type 1 than by type 2 EBNA2, and one of these genes (CXCR7) was shown to be required for proliferation of lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus LMP1 gene was also more strongly induced by type 1 EBNA2 than by type 2, but this effect was transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 1 and type 2 EBNA2 were equally effective at arresting cell proliferation of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines lacking Epstein-Barr virus and were also shown to cause <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that differential gene regulation by Epstein-Barr virus type 1 and type 2 EBNA2 may be the basis for the much weaker B-cell transformation activity of type 2 Epstein-Barr virus strains compared to type 1 strains </plain></SENT>
