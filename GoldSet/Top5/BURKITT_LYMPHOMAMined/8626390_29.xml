<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the isolation and characterization of cDNAs encoding full-length human and murine cyclin G1 and a novel human homologue of this cyclin designated cyclin G2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclin G1 is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle, ovary, and kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following an initial up-regulation from early G1 to G1/S phase, cyclin G1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is constitutively expressed throughout the cell cycle in T and B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in stimulated peripheral T cells, cyclin G1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is maximal in early G1 phase and declines in cell cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cyclin G1 levels parallel p53 expression in murine B lymphocytes; however, in several human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, murine lymphocytes treated with transforming growth factor-beta, early murine embryos, and several tissues of p53 null mice, cyclin G1 levels are either inverse of p53 levels or expressed independent of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cyclin G1 homologue, cyclin G2, exhibits 60% nucleotide sequence identity and 53% amino acid sequence identity with cyclin G1, and like cyclin G1, exhibits closest sequence identity to the cyclin A family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distinct from cyclin G1, the amino acid sequence for cyclin G2 shows a PEST-rich sequence and a potential Shc PTB binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cyclin G2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is differentially expressed compared to cyclin G1, the highest transcript levels seen in cerebellum, thymus, spleen, prostate, and kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the constitutive expression of cyclin G1 in lymphocytes, cyclin G2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> appears to oscillate through the cell cycle with peak expression in late S phase </plain></SENT>
