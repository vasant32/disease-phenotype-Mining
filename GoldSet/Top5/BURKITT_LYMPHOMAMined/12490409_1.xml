<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous reactivation of EBV in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell line P3HR-1 was inhibited when the cells were cultured in L-Arg-supplemented medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of EBV early antigen (EA), immediate-early BZLF1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and the protein ZEBRA, and production of infectious virus were reduced by L-Arg supplementation in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that inducible NO synthase (iNOS) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was constitutively expressed in P3HR-1 cells, as quantitated by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>L-Arg supplementation enhanced iNOS and NOx expression in the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A specific NOS inhibitor, NG-monomethyl-L-Arg enhanced the expression of ZEBRA and early BMRF1 protein EA-D in the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>L-Arg supplementation also inhibited the spontaneous EBV reactivation in another <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line EB1 and a B lymphoblastoid cell line OB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that L-Arg induces iNOS and generates NO, which inhibits EBV reactivation in EBV-positive cells </plain></SENT>
