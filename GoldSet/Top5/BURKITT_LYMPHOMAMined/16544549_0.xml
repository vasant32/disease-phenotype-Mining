<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The same relationship was also shown in Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) by some researchers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to demonstrate EBV nucleic acids in tissue sections of adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of EBV encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (EBER) were investigated with in situ hybridization and EBV-DNA with PCR method in 29 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections (19 lymph nodes, the others being gastric, orbital, skin, salivary gland, testicle, small intestinal, tongue root, bone marrow and gingival tissues) of 8 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> and 21 patients with NHL who were followed-up in Haematology Clinics of our university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBER and EBV-DNA positivity rates were found as follows respectively; 50% (n: 4) and 37.5% (n: 3) of 8 HL patients, and 23.8% (n: 5) and 47.6% (n: 10) of 21 NHL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In total evaluation EBER and/or EBV-DNA were positive in 5 of 8 (62.5%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, and 12 of 21 (57.1%) NHL tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in EBER and EBV-DNA positivity between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> and NHL groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result, our study emphasize a possible EBV related aetiology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> and NHL </plain></SENT>
