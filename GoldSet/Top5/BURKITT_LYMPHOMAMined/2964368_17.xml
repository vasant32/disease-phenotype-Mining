<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We discovered a binding titration of the interferons IFN-alpha A and IFN-alpha D in the pH range 6-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Receptor binding, negligible at pH 6, rises to a maximum close to pH 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have shown that binding of IFN-alpha A at basic pH is to the same receptors as at neutrality and that IFN-receptor complexes extracted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27729">digitonin</z:chebi> are more stable at basic pH than they are at neutrality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recombinant interferon, IFN-alpha B, shows little change of binding in the pH range 6-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At its basic optimum the binding of IFN-alpha A approaches that of IFN-alpha B, while at neutral pH the binding of IFN-alpha A is 3-4 times less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This difference at neutral pH is seen on intact cells as well as on membrane preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The specific activity of IFN-alpha B is close to that of IFN-alpha A, both of which are 10-20 times more active than IFN-alpha D; and the binding titration is, therefore, independent of the initial binding affinities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using hybrid IFNs constructed from the DNA sequences of alpha D and alpha B, we have isolated the sequence responsible for the binding titration to the segment comprising amino acids 61-92 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Examination of these sequences reveals that Lys-84 is present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the IFN-alpha except IFN-alpha B where it is replaced by Glu; and Tyr-90, present in most of the common IFN-alpha including alpha A and alpha D, is replaced by Asp in IFN-alpha B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lys and Tyr would normally titrate in the pH range 6-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the binding titration is due to an electrostatic interaction and we propose that the interaction is between IFN-receptor complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The role of the interaction in the binding losses that accompany the antiproliferative effects of IFN is discussed </plain></SENT>
