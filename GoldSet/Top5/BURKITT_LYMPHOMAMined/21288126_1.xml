<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the role of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) to diagnose post-transplantation <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (PTLD) in pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four patients (20 male, 14 female) underwent organ transplantation (14 liver, 14 kidney, 3 heart, 2 lung, 1 heart-lung) from May 1992 to November 2008 (mean age at transplantation, 66 months; range, 5-277), in whom a biopsy was performed for suspected PTLD from May 1993 to September 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The time point of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, type of PTLD, rate of intraabdominal manifestations with need of MIS, and its accuracy were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four of 34 patients (70%) had biopsies of superficial lymph nodes (9), oropharyngeal biopsy (5), gastrointestinal endoscopy or bronchoscopy (5), ultrasound-guided biopsies (3), biopsy of the bone marrow (1), or of the orbita (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data of the technique used were unavailable in 3 (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to lack of superficially located lesions, 6 of 34 patients (18%) had laparoscopic biopsy, of which 4 had abdominal organ graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic biopsy was successful in 5 of 6 cases (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>Abscess</z:mpath> formation at area of transplanted kidney led to conversion in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> extension to the abdominal wall led to a primary biopsy via a mini-laparotomy in another case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient with abdominal Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> developed a trocar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, successfully treated by systemic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No other complications were observed after MIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Accuracy of MIS biopsies was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of PTLD was significantly later diagnosed in cases of explicit intraabdominal PTLD (81 ± 6.3 versus 28 ± 5.3 months; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Morbidity and mortality were not influenced by biopsy technique or time point of PTLD <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In 20% of pediatric PTLD cases an intraabdominal biopsy is required due to explicit intraabdominal manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>As laparoscopic surgery was even feasible in patients after prior abdominal organ transplantation, we suggest laparoscopic biopsy as a safe tool for diagnosing PTLD </plain></SENT>
