<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most studies have been restricted to specific histological types such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>osteogenic sarcoma</z:hpo> or Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study describes the relative frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> seen in the head and neck region of children below 16 years of age at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 281 cases of paediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018671" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck tumours</z:e> were diagnosed within the study period, out of which 84 cases were malignant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four of these cases were males while 30 were females, giving a male to female ratio of 1.8:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age range for these cases was 3 days to 15 years with a mean age of 9.03 +/- 4.63 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequently diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were haematopoietic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, accounting for 47.6% of cases, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> (27.4%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (21.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> constituted 28.6%, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> accounting for 17.9% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> of the head and neck region are rare in the paediatric age group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, malignant head and neck <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in the paediatric age group also showed the male preponderance characteristic of head and neck <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in the adult population </plain></SENT>
