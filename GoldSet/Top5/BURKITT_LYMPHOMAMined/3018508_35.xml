<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line KK124, which contains a reciprocal t(8;22) translocation, was shown to have rearranged in a region 3' to the c-myc proto-oncogene on chromosome 8 and 5' to the lambda constant region on chromosome 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint was cloned and sequenced, revealing that c-myc and a portion of its 3' region abutted a complete lambda variable gene that had undergone V-J recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since this cell line expresses kappa light chain, this lambda rearrangement violates the previously proposed hierarchy of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A novel duplication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 8 sequences was also found at the breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first exon of c-myc and its flanking sequence from the translocated allele was sequenced and compared with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extensive mutation was found within the first exon in contrast to its 3' and 5' flanking regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>S1 nuclease analysis revealed that it was the translocated c-myc being expressed and that there was a promoter shift from P2 to P1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The detailed structural analysis of this cell line provides clues concerning mechanisms of chromosomal translocation and c-myc deregulation in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
