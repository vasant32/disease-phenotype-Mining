<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The factor that determines the antigenic type of IFN produced in human lymphoblastoid cell lines was examined using live Sendai virus, ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated virus, HANA spikes exposed on L cells persistently infected with Sendai virus (L-HVJ) and poly-inosinic acid poly-cytidylic acid (poly I: C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When Sendai virus was irradiated with UV-light for 300 sec, its abilities to infect chicken eggs and induce IFN were diminished, but its HA activity was unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HANA spikes exposed on L-HVJ could not induce IFN in human lymphoblastoid cell lines, although they induced IFN in mouse spleen cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the induction of IFN in human lymphoblastoid cells is closely related to <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> nucleic acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Poly I: C also induced IFN in some human lymphoblastoid cell lines in which IFN production is induced by Sendai virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The antigenic types of IFN induced by poly I: C were the same as those induced by Sendai virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the antigenic type of IFN produced depends on the nature of the IFN producer cells rather than on the kind of IFN inducer </plain></SENT>
