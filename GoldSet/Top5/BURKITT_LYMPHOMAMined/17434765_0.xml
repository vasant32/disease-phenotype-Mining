<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Familial occurrences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> alone, or as part of a syndromic disease, have been reported, and for some the underlying genetic mutation has been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> inherited phenotype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and red cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> in a four-generation pedigree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in the youngest generation, a 2-year-old boy presenting with these familial features has developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> characterized by a t(12;21) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tri-lineage involvement of platelets, red cells and white cells may suggest a genetic defect in an early multiliear progenitor or a stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional assays in EBV-transformed cell lines revealed a defect in cell proliferation and tubulin dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two candidate genes, RUNX1 and FOG1, were sequenced but no pathogenic mutation was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Identification of the underlying genetic defect(s) in this family may help in understanding the complex process of hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
