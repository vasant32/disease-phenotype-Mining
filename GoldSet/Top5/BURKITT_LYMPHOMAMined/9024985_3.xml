<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested 41 HIV noninfected children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e> (27 cases of Burkitt's-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, six cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, four cases of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, three cases of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and one case of large-cell anaplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) for the presence of type D retroviral serological and genetical markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five healthy donors were tested as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA samples from peripheral blood lymphocytes were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blotting for the presence of type D retroviral related sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MPMV pro-pol specific sequences have been detected in 18 out of 27 children with Burkitt's-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By means of Western blotting, six patients positive in PCR/Southern blotting analysis were also found to contain Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) specific antibodies, in their sera </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest the possible association of type D retroviral markers with Burkitt's-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of children </plain></SENT>
