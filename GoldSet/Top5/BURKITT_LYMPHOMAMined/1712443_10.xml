<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> exposure of human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and mouse M1 myeloblastic cell lines to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>), reduced by more than 90% the PKC protein levels and enzymatic activity in cell extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of PKC from cells abrogated the ability of IFN (alpha + beta) to arrest cell growth at the G0/G1 resting phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, other responses to IFN such as the induction of (2'-5') oligoadenylate synthetase gene, continued to take place at the same dose response pattern thus excluding the possibility that early targets in the pathway, such as the number or affinity of IFN cell surface receptors might be affected by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same prolonged treatment of M1 cells with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> did not interfere with the ability of another cytokine, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), to induce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> type of G0/G1 arrest further supporting the specificity of the effect towards IFN responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of PKC from cells did not interfere with the negative effects of IFN on c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression in spite of the direct involvement of this molecular event in growth responses to IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The putative PKC dependent molecular event could therefore function either downstream to or in combination with the reduction in c-myc protein levels, providing a necessary but not a sufficient step to arrest cell cycle progression at the G0/G1 phase </plain></SENT>
