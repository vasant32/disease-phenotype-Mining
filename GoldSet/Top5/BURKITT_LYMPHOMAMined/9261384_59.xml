<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This protein is highly expressed along with a second nuclear antigen, EBNA-2, during the initial stages of virus-induced B-cell transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While EBNA-2's essential role in transformation as a transcriptional activatory is well documented, very little is known about EBNA-LP function except that recombinant viruses lacking the EBNA-LP Y1Y2 exons show reduced, but still detectable, transforming ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was taken as evidence that EBNA-LP plays an auxiliary role but is not essential for transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A recent study showed that EBNA-LP could cooperate with EBNA-2 in activating cyclin D2 transcription in resting B cells (A.J </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Here we report that EBNA-LP can also cooperate with EBNA-2 in up-regulating expression of the major EBV effector protein of B-cell transformation, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In transient-transfection assays, EBNA-LP enhanced the level of EBNA-2-induced LMP1 expression by 5- to 10-fold in one Latency I Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Eli-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, and was absolutely required, along with EBNA-2, to induce LMP1 in a second line, Akata-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These changes in LMP1 protein expression appeared to be reflected at the transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A study of EBNA-LP mutants showed that this cooperative function mapped to the W1W2 repeat domain rather than to Y1Y2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because a Y1Y2-deleted form of EBNA-LP may therefore retain some aspects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> function, the original data from virus recombinants leave open the possibility that EBNA-LP is actually an essential transforming gene </plain></SENT>
