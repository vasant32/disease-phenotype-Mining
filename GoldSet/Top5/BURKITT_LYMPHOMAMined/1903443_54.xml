<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> previously shown to respond to heating in this manner might be expected to provide insights not only into the mechanism of hyperthermic cell killing, but also into the apoptotic process in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by 43 degrees C heating for 30 min in two human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, BM 13674 and WW1, and in murine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_350'>mastocytoma</z:mpath> P-815 x 2.1 was found to be exclusively apoptotic in type, identification being based on light and electron microscopic appearances and on the presence of internucleosomal cleavage of DNA into fragments that are multiples of 180-200 base pairs, which was demonstrated by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The heat-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was prevented by the presence of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35176">zinc sulphate</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of the endonuclease considered to be responsible for the DNA cleavage, but was not suppressed by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48001">protein synthesis inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings question the validity of the widely held view that active protein synthesis is an invariable prerequisite for the execution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-mediated increase in cytosolic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>, resulting from limited membrane damage, might be the critical event responsible for activation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
