<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Northern blot analysis human Met-ase (Hu-Met-1) cDNA hybridized with a 0.9-kb <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in two human NK <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines, unstimulated human PBMC, and untreated purified CD3-CD56+ large granular lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unlike other members of the granzyme family that are highly expressed in activated peripheral T cells, the Hu-Met-1 transcript was barely detected in a population of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> and ionomycin or IL-2-treated high density T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several in vitro cultured Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>- and promyeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo>, and colon and <z:mp ids='MP_0003579'>ovarian carcinomas</z:mp> and colon and <z:mp ids='MP_0003579'>ovarian carcinomas</z:mp> did not express Hu-Met-1 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hu-Met-1 mRNA expression in a small number of human T cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lines did not correlate with any particular phenotype or stage of development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of Hu-Met-1 mRNA closely correlated with the Met-ase activity of cellular lysates prepared from these various human peripheral blood subsets and in vitro cultured cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Met-ase activity detected in whole cell lysates of cytotoxic lymphocytes was associated with the cytoplasmic granules of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide sequence of the Hu-Met-1 cDNA clone encodes a predicted serine protease of 257 amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The predicted protein is an active enzyme of 232 amino acids with a calculated unglycosylated m.w. of 27,100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hu-Met-1 is 66% identical to RNK-Met-1 at the amino acid level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The human and rat mature protein sequences conserve the active site His, Asp, and Ser amino acids that form the catalytic triad of serine proteases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 8 cysteine residues, and several amino acids critical in the formation of the substrate binding pocket </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The gene for the Hu-Met-1 serine protease is located on chromosome 19, which distinguishes it from any other member of the human granzyme family </plain></SENT>
