<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its association with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> prevents the binding of TFIIB and leads to inhibition of preinitiation complex formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate the association of NC2 subunit-alpha with human <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase II promoter regions by using gene-specific ChIP and genome-wide promoter ChIPchip analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We find NC2alpha associated with a large number of human promoters, where it peaks close to the core regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NC2 occupancy in vivo positively correlates with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, which perhaps reflects its capacity to stabilize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> on promoter regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In single gene analyses, we confirm core promoter binding and in addition map the NC2 complex to enhancer proximal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-occupancy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> genes display a stable NC2/TFIIB ratio during the cell cycle, which otherwise varies markedly from one gene to another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter is at least in part explained by an observed negative correlation of NC2 occupancy with the presence of the TFIIB recognition element in core promoter regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data establish the genome-wide basis for general and gene-specific functions of NC2 in mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
