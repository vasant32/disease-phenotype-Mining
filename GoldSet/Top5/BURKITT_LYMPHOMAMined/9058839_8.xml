<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Soluble isoforms of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules have recently been found in the circulation, but the physiologic effects of such molecules are still unconfirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our earlier study suggests that the serum level of the 70- to 80-kDa form of CD44 (sCD44) parallels the clinical treatment response in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated the origin and the function of sCD44 in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both peripheral blood and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lymphocytes were able to shed soluble CD44 in cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mouse model, transplanted Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Namalwa) cells transfected with human CD44 shed soluble CD44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In binding studies sCD44 was able to adhere to hyaluronate and fibronectin, and moreover, sCD44 was able to block the binding of hyaluronate to CD44 on the cell surface and to block the binding of lymphocytes to high endothelial venules, suggesting that sCD44 retains its biological activity although it does not contain the cytoplasmic tail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, sCD44 is biologically active and is at least partially shed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
