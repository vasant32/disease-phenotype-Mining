<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and steroids, these patients received courses of intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi>, because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025284" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">meningeal tumor</z:e> cell infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole brain radiation was also given either before or during intrathecal therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of the children had a progressive irreversible neurologic illness, which developed either at or shortly after the completion of combined triple intrathecal therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> ensuing approximately 2 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neuropathologic lesions consisted of discrete multifocal necroses of coagulative type, apparently extending by confluence, and disseminated in the cerebral white matter in a random manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one case, extensive symmetrical demyelinating and necrotizing lesions involved the centrum ovale bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a remarkable absence of inflammatory cellular response and a relative paucity of macrophage reaction, with usually little or no tissue breakdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> and glial cell loss, there was striking axonal damage, with conspicuous axonal swelling both within and around the necrotizing lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The surrounding white matter showed focal status spongiosus and a moderate astrocytic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vascular fibrinoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was inconstant and, except in one case, rarely observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The possible causal relationship of these lesions to combined triple intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolite</z:chebi> therapy and brain radiation is discussed </plain></SENT>
