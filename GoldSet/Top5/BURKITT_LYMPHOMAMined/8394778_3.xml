<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to validate the two assays, we have investigated the responses to 12-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="45127">phorbol-13-acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>), 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (DAG), phospholipase C (PLC EC-3-1-4-30) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> A23187, which are active in both systems: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> were found active only in the CL test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">Staurosporine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37699">protein kinase inhibitor</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50837">estrogen antagonist</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37700">protein kinase C inhibitor</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> (protein kinase A activator), R59949 (diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetyl-L-cysteine</z:chebi> (scavengers of reactive oxygen species) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> acted as inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A good concordance of the EC50 values of inducing substances was found between the two assays, except for A23187 and DAG, which were required at much higher concentrations in the DR-CAT test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibition patterns by the panel of inhibitors revealed similarities and discrepancies in the induction pathways between the two systems, providing information on their mode of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two assays, which complement each other, were shown to detect a number of known or suspected EBV inducers or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> promoters, and thus appear useful for screening of new compounds or mixtures as well as of potential antiviral and antipromoting substances </plain></SENT>
