<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this present study, clones of B cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_339'>lymphatic leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL) and lymphoblastoid 'Raji' cells were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The surface of these cells was labelled with 125I by the lactoperoxidase technique and the cell membrane proteins solubilized with the detergent NP40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16541">polypeptide chain</z:chebi> of molecular weight 103K was precipitated with F(ab')2 anti-serum Factor B, and not with a control antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This 103K protein was also found if Raji cells were biosynthetically labelled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi>-leucine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the radiolabelled cells were incubated with cobra venom factor (CVF) and Factor D, two specific <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were precipitated by F(ab')w anti-Factor B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the larger fragment forms a complex with CVF, since it could be precipitated by anti-CVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These events are similar to those involving serum Factor B and CVF </plain></SENT>
