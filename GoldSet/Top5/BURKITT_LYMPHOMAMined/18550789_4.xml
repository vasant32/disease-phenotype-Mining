<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, expressing high levels of transmembrane (tm)TNF-alpha, are resistant to secretory (s)TNF-alpha-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> but sensitive to tmTNF-alpha-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As tmTNF-alpha mediates "forward" as well as "reverse" signaling, we hypothesize that a balanced signaling between forward and reverse directions may play a critical role in determining the fate of cells bearing tmTNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using Raji cells as a model, we first added exogenous tmTNF-alpha on fixed, transfected NIH3T3 cells onto Raji cells to examine tmTNF-alpha forward signaling and its effects, showing that constitutive NF-kappaB activity and cellular inhibitor-of-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein 1 transcription were down-regulated, paralleled with Raji cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As Raji cells express tmTNF-alpha, an inhibition of their tmTNF-alpha expression by antisense oligonucleotide caused down-regulation of NF-kappaB activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, increasing tmTNF-alpha expression by suppressing expression of TNF-alpha-converting enzyme that cleaves tmTNF-alpha led to an enhanced activation of NF-kappaB, indicating that tmTNF-alpha, but not sTNF-alpha, contributes to constitutive NF-kappaB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We next transfected Raji cells with a mutant tmTNF-alpha lacking the intracellular domain to competitively suppress reverse signaling via tmTNF-alpha; as expected, constitutive NF-kappaB activity was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, treating Raji cells with sTNFR2 to stimulate reverse signaling via tmTNF-alpha enhanced NF-kappaB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that tmTNF-alpha, when highly expressed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and acting as a receptor, promotes NF-kappaB activation through reverse signaling, which is helpful to maintain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, tmTNF-alpha, when acting as a ligand, inhibits NF-kappaB activity through forward signaling, which is inclined to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
