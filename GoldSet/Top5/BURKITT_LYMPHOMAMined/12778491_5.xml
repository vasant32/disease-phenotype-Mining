<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stat6-binding sites are present in the promoters of both ubiquitously and cell-type-specifically expressed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The promoter regions of IL-4-inducible genes contain cis-acting elements for several transcription factors that act in concert with Stat6 and are also likely to modulate lineage-specific gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have observed that the Stat6 response element from the B-cell-specific Igepsilon promoter is readily activated upon IL-4 stimulation in B cells but not in non-hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A minimal low-affinity PU.1-core-binding sequence (5'-AGAA-3') was identified within the Stat6 DNA-binding site in the Igepsilon promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of the myeloid- and B-cell-specific transcription factor PU.1 restored the IL-4-inducibility of the Igepsilon-Stat6 response element in HepG2 cells, and the induction required an intact PU.1-binding sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both the transactivation and the DNA-binding domains of PU.1 were required for induction of Stat6-mediated transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The co-operation between PU.1 and Stat6 in transactivation of the Igepsilon gene represents a molecular mechanism for the fine-tuning of cell-type-restricted expression of IL-4-induced gene responses </plain></SENT>
