<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>53 patients with B-cell precursor ALL were followed during and after completion of treatment (median follow-up 23 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients relapsed and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> had been detected in six of them, 5-15 weeks before relapse despite morphological complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>43 patients remain in clinical remission and in none of these was <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival based on the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> by flow cytometry showed a statistically significant difference between both groups (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> correlates with a low relapse rate, whereas the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> predicted early relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study has shown that flow cytometry can improve the morphologic assessment of bone marrow (BM) remission status in B-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding of &lt; 5% blasts in BM aspirates did not correlate with 'true' remission in a proportion of cases as residual leukaemic blasts were detected by flow cytometry in nine samples from six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the presence of &gt; 5% blasts assessed by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was not necessarily a feature of relapse in five patients as these cells were shown to have a phenotype identical to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> TdT-negative B-cell precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Quantitative flow cytometry was more informative than conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> to assess remission status and showed a strong correlation with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This methodology is useful to define <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> in the majority of patients with B-lineage ALL and should be tested in prospective clinical trials </plain></SENT>
