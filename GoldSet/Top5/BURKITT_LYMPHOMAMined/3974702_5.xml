<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in addition to inducing an antiviral state, interferon inhibits cell division, increases the expression of cell-surface antigens, boosts the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells and modulates several immune functions of lymphocytes and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a special class of interferon (immune interferon or IFN-gamma) is produced by T cells following stimulation with antigen or interaction with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The different methods by which interferon is induced and its multiple effects suggest that it may be part of a first-line defence system controlling the spread of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infections</z:e> and the proliferation of modified 'self' cells that have been affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ability of certain human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to activate the alternative pathway of complement is well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we show that monoclonal antibody-purified interferon can amplify the ability of certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells to activate complement via the alternative pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This demonstration may reflect an additional, as yet unknown, role of interferon in inducing non-specific anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519680" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumour immunity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
