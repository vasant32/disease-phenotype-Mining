<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF beta 1) is known to cause <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that while it is by itself capable of promoting some degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in group IBL cells, TGF beta 1 cooperates with anti-immunoglobulin to this end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trimeric soluble recombinant human CD40 ligand (sCD40L) was able to inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by the combination of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> to some degree, but such rescue proved to be short-lived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both TGF beta 1 and anti-Ig individually caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> at the G1 phase of cell cycle before their entry into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>: the consequence of sCD40L addition was to maintain the cells in cycle for longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No induction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-protecting gene, bcl-2, occurred in the presence of sCD40L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings are discussed, particularly highlighting the relationship existing between survival and the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The strong cooperative effects observed between anti-Ig and TGF beta 1 in promoting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the inability of CD40 to signal for long-term rescue raise the potential for a novel therapeutic attack on B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
