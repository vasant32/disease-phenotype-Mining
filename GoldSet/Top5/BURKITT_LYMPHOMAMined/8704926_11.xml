<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This work demonstrates that our previously developed technique for single-erythrocyte analysis by capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection (CE-LIF) can be applied to study individual lymphocytes, with some modification in the cell lysing procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A tesla coil was shown to be capable of lysing the lymphocyte cells inside the capillary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The electromagnetic field induced by the tesla coil was believed to be responsible for breaking the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzyme activities and relative ratios between different LDH isoenzymes were measured for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes as well as B-type and T-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both the LDH activity and the isoenzyme ratios show large variations among individual cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The former is expected due to variations in cell size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter implies that single-cell measurements are less useful than the average values over a cell population as markers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
