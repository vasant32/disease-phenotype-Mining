<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Five monoclonal antibodies which are reactive to early antigens of Epstein-Barr virus have been produced by using somatic cell hybridization techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the monoclonal antibodies to early antigens was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence, which showed that the antigens were localized to the nucleus of early antigen-induced Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional indirect immunofluorescence studies showed that like patient antisera to diffuse-staining early antigen, the monoclonal antibodies gave positive staining reactions after <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi> fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the antibodies, 1150-4, was positive by the anti-complement immunofluorescence technique but differed with Epstein-Barr virus-associated nuclear antigen-positive patient sera in that it only stained induced cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different fixation methods were found to alter dramatically the appearance of the nuclear staining reactions produced by the monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot experiments revealed that monoclonal antibodies 1108-1 and 1129-1 recognized two <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> of 55,000 and 50,000 daltons (p55;50), 1173-6 and 1180-2 recognized just p50, and 1150-4 identified a 65,000-dalton nuclear protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunobiochemical characterization of these <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigens showed that p55 is a phosphoprotein, and p55;50 has strong DNA-binding activity preferentially to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elucidation of the role of these nuclear proteins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epstein-Barr virus infection</z:e> and the events associated with Epstein-Barr virus-directed lymphocyte transformation may provide significant information on the pathogenicity of this important human virus </plain></SENT>
