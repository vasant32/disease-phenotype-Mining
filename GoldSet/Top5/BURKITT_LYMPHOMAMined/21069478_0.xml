<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> chains make them excellent candidates for the cell surface recognition molecules </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Globotriaosylceramide constitutes rare P k blood group antigen on erythrocytes, and it is also known as Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On endothelial cells, globotriaosylceramide plays as the receptor for <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> toxins of the Shiga family, also called verotoxins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Precise biological function and significance of globotriaosylceramide expression on endothelial cells remains to be the subject of many studies and it is believed globotriaosylceramide represents an example of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> antigen able to transduce a signal leading to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In past decade, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> researches put a great afford in determining new therapeutic agents such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> toxins against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
