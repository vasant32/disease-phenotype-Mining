<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Integrin-associated protein (IAP)/CD47 is a 50-kd cell surface protein that is physically associated with beta3 integrins and that modulates the functions of beta3 integrins in various cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in B-lymphocytes that express beta1 integrins but few beta3 integrins, the roles of IAP/CD47 remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cross-linking of IAP/CD47 by the immobilized anti-IAP/CD47 monoclonal antibody (mAb) B6H12, but not 2D3, produced signals to promote polarization with lamellipodia, a characteristic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> during leukocyte migration, in pre-B and mature B-cell lines (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">BALL</z:e>, Nalm6, ONHL-1, Daudi), but not in <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines (RPMI8226, OPM-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the presence of the immobilized fibronectin (FN), soluble B6H12 could increase the rate of the polarization and activate migratory activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">BALL</z:e> cells to FN in a transwell filter assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the dominant-negative form of CDC42 completely blocked B6H12-induced morphologic and functional changes without inhibiting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>-induced spreading on FN in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">BALL</z:e> cells, whereas the dominant-negative form of Rac1 inhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that in B-lymphocytes, IAP/CD47 may transduce the signals to activate the migratory activity, in which CDC42 may be specifically involved, and that IAP/CD47 shows synergistic effect with alpha4beta1 on B-cell migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings would provide new insight into the role of IAP/CD47 on B-cell function </plain></SENT>
