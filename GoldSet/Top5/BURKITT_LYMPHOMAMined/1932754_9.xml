<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most eBL, mutations in or near exon 1 disrupt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc regulatory sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined c-myc sequences from a patient with sBL and two patients with eBL to determine (1) whether mutation is ongoing as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> clone expands, (2) the nature of mutations in the protein-coding exons 2 and 3, and (3) the extent of c-myc hypermutation in the two clinical forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we amplified segments of c-myc from bulk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples, cloned the products into plasmid vectors, and sequenced multiple subclones of each segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutation frequencies in the control (remission bone marrow) and sBL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subclones were 0.65 x 10(-4) and 3.0 x 10(-4) (mutations/base), respectively (P greater than .25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subclones from the two eBLs exhibited mutation frequencies of 20 x 10(-4) and 16 x 10(-4), respectively (P less than .001 v control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the consensus mutations seen in one eBL, a random pattern of unshared mutations was observed throughout c-myc in both samples, demonstrating that mutations may be introduced in a stepwise fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We noted a clear excess of transitions over transversions (30:9), which is qualitatively similar to the pattern observed in diverse examples of eukaryotic gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that c-myc hypermutation is an ongoing process as the eBL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> clone expands, is qualitatively different from immunoglobulin gene hypermutation, and is not a universal feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, perhaps reflecting the nature of the translocation or the stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell maturation </plain></SENT>
