<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of the studied combinations related to the simultaneous surface and cytoplasmic marker expression, others, expressed mainly on cell surface membrane, represented atypical or aberrant combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparing membrane (m) and cytoplasmic (c) antigen expression (followed in 23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> cases), we observed that CD3 could be detected in cytoplasm in the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> cells, while was absent on cell surface membrane where simultaneous expression of more immature T cell markers, such as CD7 and CD5, could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combination of mCD7/cCD3 could be regarded as a suitable marker of individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cases of B-precursors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> cells, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-related combination of mCD19/cCD22 was found, which could characterize a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cells in one of 11 AML followed cases were positive for CD13 in cytoplasm, but not on cell surface membrane, where CD33 and other myeloid antigens were expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cells in another two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases were positive for CD11 in cytoplasm but not on cell surface membrane, where CD13 or CD33 were expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Again, marker combinations of mCD33/cCD13 and mCD13 or mCD33/cCD11, respectively, represent a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-related feature, suitable for tracing single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells in double immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>Acute leukemia</z:hpo> defined by the coexpression on most blast cells of antigens classically attributed to different lineages (referred as atypical/aberrant marker combinations) remains a rare event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We isolated a series of 27 (12%) such cases of 225 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> patients whose cells were immunophenotyped at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Myeloid markers were present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> of two cases, T and B markers were coexpressed in 13 cases, markers of B and myeloid lineage were associated in one case, and T cell and myeloid antigens were found in 10 AML cases; in one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> case (M3 according to FAB classification) an aberrant nuclear coexpression of TdT was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In one case of the last group an interesting antigen combination of CD4/CD34 present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with monocytic differentiation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When 5 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated (aberrant) markers were again analyzed at relapse, the relevant antigen combinations were retained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In summary, 44 of 50 cases (88%) from our <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> series studied for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated antigen combination, both with surface membrane and cytoplasmic marker combinations and those with aberrant markers coexpression allow the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
