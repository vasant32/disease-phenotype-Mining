<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Whether certain Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) strains are associated with pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) is still an unresolved question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, EBV genome contained in a primary NPC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsy was amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and sequenced using next-generation (Illumina) and conventional dideoxy-DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EBV genome, designated HKNPC1 (Genbank accession number JQ009376) is a type 1 EBV of approximately 171.5 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The virus appears to be a uniform strain in line with accepted monoclonal nature of EBV in NPC but is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> at 172 nucleotide positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis with the four published EBV strains, B95-8, AG876, GD1, and GD2, indicated HKNPC1 was more closely related to the Chinese NPC patient-derived strains, GD1 and GD2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HKNPC1 contains 1,589 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 132 insertions or deletions (indels) in comparison to the reference EBV sequence (accession number NC007605) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When compared to AG876, a strain derived from Ghanaian Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we found 322 SNVs, of which 76 were non-synonymous SNVs and were shared amongst the Chinese GD1, GD2 and HKNPC1 isolates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed 88 non-synonymous SNVs shared only by HKNPC1 and GD2, the only other NPC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-derived strain reported thus far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Non-synonymous SNVs were mainly found in the latent, tegument and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The same point mutations were found in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (BLLF1 and BALF4) genes of GD1, GD2 and HKNPC1 strains and might affect cell type specific binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Variations in LMP1 and EBNA3B <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> and mutations in Cp (11404 C&gt;T) and Qp (50134 G&gt;C) found in GD1, GD2 and HKNPC1 could potentially affect CD8(+) T cell recognition and latent gene expression pattern in NPC, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we showed that whole genome sequencing of EBV in NPC may facilitate discovery of previously unknown variations of pathogenic significance </plain></SENT>
