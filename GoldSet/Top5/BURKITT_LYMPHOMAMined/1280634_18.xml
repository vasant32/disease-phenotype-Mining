<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Tenascin is an extracellular matrix <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> produced in response to epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that initiate fetal organogenesis, and it is also found in the stroma of benign and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five human cell lines representing a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were examined by immunoprecipitation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis of radiolabeled tenascin proteins from conditioned media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two forms of tenascin with relative molecular masses of 190,000 and 250,000 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight cell lines produced both forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the exception of myeloid and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemias</z:hpo> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the mesodermal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206093" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neuroectodermal tumor</z:e> lines were found to synthesize tenascin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, tenascin was secreted by several mammary and <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colonic adenocarcinomas</z:mp> as well as by a line derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mammary epithelial cells, and in some cases increased production was induced by transforming growth factor beta in serum-free medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cells producing fibronectin but not tenascin attached and spread on plastic culture dishes, while those producing tenascin alone remained suspended in the medium or were rarely attached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tenascin also inhibited fibronectin-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of MCF7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that tenascins synthesized and secreted by some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, especially those of epithelial origin, may have specific roles in determining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and ultimately the ability to form invasive outgrowths </plain></SENT>
