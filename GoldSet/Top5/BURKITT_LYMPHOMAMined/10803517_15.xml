<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential impact of this form of therapy in pediatric precursor B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e>) has yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mabs directed against the cell surface antigens, CD19 and CD22 conjugated to deglycosylated ricin A chain (dgRTA) have been tested in patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), but not in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the encouraging performance of these ITs in phase I trials, we evaluated the specific cytotoxicity of anti-CD19 (HD37-dgRTA) and anti-CD22 (RFB4-dgRTA) ITs or their combination (Combotox) on patient-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> cells maintained in vitro on a stromal feeder layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 48 h in culture, cytotoxicity to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells was determined by flow cytometry using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>)-conjugated anti-CD10, 19, and 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both RFB4-dgRTA and HD37-dgRTA induced a statistically significant reduction in the number of viable leukemic cells, and Combotox was even more effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that these ITs are specifically cytotoxic to primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> cells and that they should be further evaluated for the therapy of B-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
