<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The small number of patients and the paucity of data make large-series studies difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a pooled analysis to evaluate the treatment outcome and prognostic factors in patients with primary breast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a search of PUBMED and MEDLINE we found 7 observational studies with 93 patientsthatwere eligible for inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatments included single therapy or combined surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the correlation between treatment protocols, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> relapse and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathology and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage were analyzed to evaluate their significance in treatment outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 93 patients were female, with a mean age of 57 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The histopathology of 63 patients (68%) was diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to Ann Arbor classification, 57% were stage I, 23% were stage II, 4% were stage III, and 16% were stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirteen percent received surgery alone, 27% received chemotherapy alone, 7% received radiotherapy alone, 10% received surgery and chemotherapy, 10% received surgery and radiotherapy, 22% received chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and 11% received surgery combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up duration of 34 months (mean, 53 months), 48% had relapse of disease, 50% had no relapse, while 2% had disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean time to first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> relapse after treatment was 20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 3-year and 5-year overall survival rates were 70% and 56%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Radiotherapy was a significant prognostic factor predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> relapse (P=0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> stage was a significant prognostic factor affecting overall survival, disease-free survival and disease-specific survival (P=0.0231, 0.0015, 0.0124, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With a 3-year overall survival rate of 70%, the high relapse rate of 48% is a cause for concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patients who received chemotherapy and radiotherapy had better survival outcome and a lower relapse rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We suggestthat chemotherapy and radiotherapy be the initial treatment for patients with primary breast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
