<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The target cell lysis was prevented by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40910">azide</z:chebi>, suggesting the involvement of the myeloperoxidase enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Catalase and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> caused a marked impairment of the neutrophil-mediated cytolysis, whereas <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase significantly enhanced the target cell destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> plays a key role in the target cell injury; <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> appears to be devoid of direct cytotoxic activity, despite its requirement as a precursor of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The target cell destruction required the presence of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16382">iodide</z:chebi> ion as oxidizable co-factor for the myeloperoxidase-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> ion alone was uneffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of target cell metabolic pathways, involved in the cellular defences against oxidative injury, by the anti-neoplastic agent 1,3-bis-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47553">2-chloroethyl</z:chebi>)-1-nitrosurea (BCNU) resulted in an increased neutrophil-mediated cytolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under the experimental conditions employed, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-activated neutrophils incubated with BCNU-treated Raji cells became cytotoxic also in the presence of the <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> ion alone as myeloperoxidase co-factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that Raji target cell destruction by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-activated neutrophils depends on the myeloperoxidase-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi>-halide system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cytolytic event is influenced by target cells themselves, which should be regarded as an active component of the cytotoxic system, capable of interfering with the lytic mediators of the effector cells </plain></SENT>
