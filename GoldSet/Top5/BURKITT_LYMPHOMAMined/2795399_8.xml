<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant coping style by intervention interaction for the self-report of experienced pain was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, those groups using an intervention that matched their preferred coping style actually reported higher experienced pain ratings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trends for differences between coping style on factors indicative of the chronicity of the disease were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chronicity, which reflects the degree of past experience with invasive medical procedures, may be a more important factor than preferred coping style in pain management of these patients </plain></SENT>
