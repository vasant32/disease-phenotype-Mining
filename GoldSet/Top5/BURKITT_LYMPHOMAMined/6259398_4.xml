<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Frequency of ever relapsing in this group varied from 12% 2 years after chemotherapy to 3-8% 3-6 years after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk of very late relapse (VLR) increased with the occurrence of meningeal disease and/or relapse before a remission of 12 months or more was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The use of combination chemotherapy and especially prophylactic intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> significantly lowered the risk of VLR (P less than 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial testing for antibodies to Epstein-Barr <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen to the diffuse and restricted components of the early antigen complex and to the Epstein-Barr virus-specific nuclear antigen revealed minor fluctuations but no consistent increases in antibody titers preceding detection of VLR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serologic follow-up tests thus were not clinically useful for prediction of the imminence of a recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients developing VLR generally maintained moderate-to-high titers of antibodies to restricted or diffuse components throughout the long remission periods, which indicated that they were not beyond the danger of a relapse at an unspecified time in the future </plain></SENT>
