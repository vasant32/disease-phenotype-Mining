<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of the four lymphoblast samples retained the germline configuration of both JH and C mu regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other two samples showed delection of the entire JH region resulting in the rearrangement of the C mu region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to patients with C mu rearrangement, patients with C mu in germline form were not able to achieve complete remission after induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study of the C mu region in patients with JH segment in germline configuration could separate subgroups in childhood precursor B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> with different prognoses </plain></SENT>
