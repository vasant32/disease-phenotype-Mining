<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The rearrangement patterns of Ig and T-cell receptor (TcR) genes were studied by Southern blot analysis in 30 precursor B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALLs</z:e>) and 10 T-ALLs at diagnosis and subsequent relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALLs</z:e> appeared to contain biclonal/oligoclonal Ig heavy-chain (IgH) gene rearrangements at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differences in rearrangement patterns between diagnosis and relapse were found in 67% (20 cases) of precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALLs</z:e> (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight biclonal/oligoclonal cases) and 50% (five cases) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALLs</z:e>, especially changes in IgH and/or TcR-delta gene rearrangements were found (17 cases), but also changes in TcR-beta, TcR-gamma, Ig kappa, and/or Ig lambda genes (11 cases) occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALLs</z:e> concerned the TcR-beta, TcR-gamma, TcR-delta, and/or IgH genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALLs</z:e> showed completely different Ig and TcR gene rearrangement patterns at relapse, suggesting the absence of a clonal relation between the leukemic cells at diagnosis and relapse and the development of a secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> in the other 23 ALL patients was based on continuing rearrangement processes and selection of subclones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The development of changes in Ig and TcR gene rearrangement patterns was related to remission duration, suggesting an increasing chance of continuing rearrangement processes with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These immunogenotypic changes at relapse occurred in a hierarchical order, with changes in IgH and TcR-delta genes occurring after only 6 months of remission duration, whereas changes in other Ig and TcR genes were generally detectable after 1 to 2 years of remission duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> reported here in Ig and/or TcR gene rearrangement patterns at diagnosis and relapse might hamper polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) using junctional regions of rearranged Ig or TcR genes as PCR targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, our data also indicate that in 75% to 90% of ALLs, at least one major rearranged IgH, TcR-gamma, or TcR-delta band (allele) remained stable at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that two or more junctional regions of different genes (IgH, TcR-gamma, and/or TcR-delta) should be monitored during follow-up of ALL patients for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> detection by use of PCR techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Especially in biclonal/oligoclonal precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cases, the monitoring should not be restricted to rearranged IgH genes, but TcR-gamma and/or TcR-delta genes should be monitored as well, because of the extensive changes in IgH gene rearrangement patterns in this ALL subgroup </plain></SENT>
