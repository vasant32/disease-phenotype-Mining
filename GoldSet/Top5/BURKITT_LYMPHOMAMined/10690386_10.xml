Classification criteria were evaluated in the international protocol FAB LMB 96 Treatment of Mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo>: A SFOP LMB 96/CCG-5961/UKCCSG NHL 9600 Cooperative Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This includes B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>: Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (including ALL-L3); high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt-like; diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (excluding anaplastic large cell Ki-1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases were independently reviewed by eight hematopathologists from the three cooperative national groups (two SFOP, two CCG, four UKCCSG), without prior discussion of classification criteria or guidelines for case rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consensus diagnosis was determined by each national cooperative group, and final consensus diagnosis established when at least two national consensus diagnoses were in agreement, or following group agreement at a multiheaded microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred eight cases were reviewed, with final consensus diagnosis established in two hundred three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percent agreement of each group's national consensus diagnosis with final consensus diagnosis was 86%, 86% and 71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percent agreement of the group's national consensus diagnosis with final consensus diagnosis for Burkitt's and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were 88% and 80%, respectively, but only 42% for Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: International panel review of mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in children and adolescents highlighted difficulties in subclassification, particularly with Burkitt-like, which is a 'provisional entity' in the R.E.A.L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The absence of previous discussion of classification and guidelines for case rejection may in part explain the discrepancy between pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results underline that <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> may need to be complemented by other studies, such as molecular genetic and cytogenetics, to discriminate between the mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
