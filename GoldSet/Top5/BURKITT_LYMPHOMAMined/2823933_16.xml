<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In two hemophilic brothers infected by the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV), Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> developed within 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients were treated by aggressive chemotherapy, and both are still in complete remission for 23 and 14 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera from both brothers contained anti-HIV antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, DNA extracted from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, when analyzed by Southern blot using a cloned HIV probe, did not reveal HIV-related sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hybridization experiments with an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) probe revealed the presence of EBV-specific sequences in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>' DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both patients' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> rearranged c-myc genes were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rearrangements occurred in both genes 3' to the third exon of c-myc, thereby suggesting that a variant chromosomal translocation took place in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, karyotype analysis of the malignant cells of one of the patients revealed the variant t(2:8) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumors</z:e> carrying this translocation, which are kappa light-chain producers, cells of our patient expressed lambda chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in both cases the lymphoblasts carried IgG on the surface, again an unusual finding in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, because both patients had an identical HLA phenotype, the role of genetic factors in the development of such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> should be considered </plain></SENT>
