<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cell lines produce an unusual strain of Epstein-Barr virus which will both transform cord blood lymphocytes and induce early antigens in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Translocations between chromosomes 8 and 22 have occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three lines, but the cells synthesize immunoglobulin M with light chains of the kappa type, in contrast to the usual concordance between a translocation involving chromosome 22 and lambda chain synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both kappa genes and one lambda gene are rearranged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate either that translocation may occur as a separate event from immunoglobulin gene rearrangement or that the proposed hierarchical sequence of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements is not always adhered to </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data also imply that in cells containing a translocation between the long arm of chromosome 8 and a chromosome bearing an immunoglobulin gene, alteration of cellular myc expression may occur regardless of the immunoglobulin gene that is expressed </plain></SENT>
