<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To answer the question whether the level of p53 expression also reflects the status of a cell, with reference to transformation and genome stability, we have examined, by immunocytochemistry, the presence of p53 protein in a number of cell types including human diploid cells, Chinese hamster embryonal cells at different passages and gene amplified and/or transformed Chinese hamster cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary human fibroblasts at early passage (LEO) and an established, non transformed, Chinese hamster cell line at early passage (CHEF/18) did not show any detectable p53 expression, either nuclear or cytoplasmic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> transformed human (Raji) and Chinese hamster cell lines (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>, V79, V79/B7) showed a nuclear expression of p53, although at different intensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two cell lines selected from V79/B7 for their resistance to phosphonacetyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29993">L-aspartate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and previously shown to bear gene amplification, showed p53 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In PALA L cells p53 expression was nuclear as in other positive cell lines tested, while in MTX M cells it was cytoplasmic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CHEF/18 cells at late passage in culture showed the typical behaviour of transformed cells and p53 was detected in several cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, when transformed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells were treated with compounds known to induce reverse transformation, both the disappearance of hallmarks of transformed phenotype and p53 reduction were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate a strong association within the same cell type between p53 expression and transformed status </plain></SENT>
