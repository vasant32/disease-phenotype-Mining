<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Stx2 B subunit, which binds to globotriaosylceramide (GB3) receptors on target cells, was cloned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This involved replacing the Stx2 B subunit leader <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> nucleotide sequences with those from the Stx1 B subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The construct was expressed in the TOPP3 E. coli strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Stx2 B subunits from this strain assembled into a pentamer and bound to a GB3 receptor analogue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cloned Stx2 B subunit was not cytotoxic to Vero cells or apoptogenic in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although their immune response to the Stx2 B subunit was variable, rabbits that developed Stx2 B subunit-specific antibodies, as determined by immunoblot and in vitro cytotoxicity neutralization assays, survived a challenge with Stx2 holotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is thought to be the first demonstration of the immunoprophylactic potential of the Stx2 B subunit </plain></SENT>
