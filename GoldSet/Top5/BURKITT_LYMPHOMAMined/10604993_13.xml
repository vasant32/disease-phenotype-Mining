<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Germinal center (GC) B cells undergo complex interactions with follicular dendritic cells (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>) and T cells in the course of differentiation into memory B and plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To delineate the individual roles of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> and T cells at each stage of GC B cell differentiation at the clonal level and to analyze the signals involved, we adopted a unique experimental model using an <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> line, HK, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, L3055, that resembles centroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A detailed phenotypic analysis revealed L3055 cells to be a clonal population originating from the GC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Like freshly isolated centroblasts, L3055 cells underwent spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> when cultured in the absence of fresh <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> or HK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>L3055 cells proliferated continuously in the presence of HK cells, while they differentiated into a population with the phenotype of centrocytes after stimulation with CD40 ligand (CD40L) and IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CD40L-stimulated L3055 cells underwent CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which was reminiscent of the feature of CD40L-stimulated tonsillar GC B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to HK cells that did not protect L3055 cells from anti-Ig killing, CD40L plus IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 prevented anti-Ig-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These experimental results demonstrate a distinct function of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> and activated T cells, in that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> provide signals for rapid proliferation of centroblasts, whereas T cells confer signals for differentiation of centroblasts into centrocytes and resistance to B cell receptor-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T cells collaborate with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> in the protection and expansion of the Ag-specific GC B cells </plain></SENT>
