<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is insufficient research into the state of paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> in African countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyse the state of paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> between 1995 and 2004 in Côte d'Ivoire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective descriptive study analysed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients under the age of 18 who were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in Côte d'Ivoire over a period of 10 years (January 1995 - December 2004) with regard to demographics, types of pathology, delay in diagnosis and treatment, treatment modalities, abandonment of treatment and survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 405 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, 331 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (73.6%), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>nephroblastoma</z:hpo> (14.5%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Delay in diagnosis occurred in 38.7% of cases and ranged from 1 to 3 months; the average delay from diagnosis to starting treatment was 18 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An abdominal mass and swelling of the jaw were the most common clinical presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Almost half of the patients (48.6%) were lost to follow-up and over a third (39.3%) died shortly after admission owing to advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rate was 9.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> in children in Côte d'Ivoire was dominated by Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of loss to follow-up of almost 50% is grounds for concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rate of 9.4% is very low, but such figures are not uncommon for African countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Collaboration within the Franco-African Group of Paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> has contributed to improving the management of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
