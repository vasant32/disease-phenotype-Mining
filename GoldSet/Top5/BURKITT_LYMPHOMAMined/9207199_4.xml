<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MIP-1alpha is involved in the homeostatic control of stem cell proliferation, in inducing chemotaxis, and also in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> in mature cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to observe modulations of MIP-1alpha secretion and expression along with MIP-1alpha receptor (MIP-1alpha-R) expression for a possible autocrine role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> associated B-cell lines, we studied a wide panel of human B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous work by us has shown that HIV-1 tat down modulates MIP-1alpha by inducing a novel transcription factor MNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data in this report suggest that HIV down modulates MIP-1alpha as a mechanism to evade suppression by this chemokine in human B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results strongly suggest MIP-1alpha autocrine loops in a majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> B-cells as evident by MIP-1alpha-R expression, and also secretion of MIP-1alpha </plain></SENT>
