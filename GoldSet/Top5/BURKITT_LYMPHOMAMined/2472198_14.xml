<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To study the immunotherapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the human pan-B-cell antigen CD19, a xenotransplantation model was developed in which the human Burkitt's cell line Daudi is s.c. transplanted into <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG2a isotype variants of the anti-CD19 mAb (CLB-CD19) were tested for their capacity to inhibit the growth of 10 x 10(6) Daudi cells injected s.c. into <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When mAb treatment was started 30 min after the injection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, only the IgG2a isotype of CLB-CD19 had a marked antitumor effect in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If treatment with IgG2a anti-CD19 mAb alone was delayed until Day 10 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> injection, no therapeutic effect was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the combination of this delayed mAb treatment with recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2) inhibited the growth of the Daudi cells in the <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice, while treatment with rIL-2 alone was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of in vitro experiments showed that peritoneal exudate cells were able to inhibit the proliferation of Daudi cells in the presence of the IgG2a isotype variant of CLB-CD19 mAb but not in the presence of the other CLB-CD19 mAb isotype variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fresh <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse spleen cells did not mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against CLB-CD19 mAb-sensitized Daudi cells, irrespective of the isotype used for sensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, preculture of these spleen cells with rIL-2 induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against CD19+ target cells sensitized with CLB-CD19 mAb of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that it is possible to enhance mAb-dependent effector systems in vivo with the lymphokine rIL-2 </plain></SENT>
