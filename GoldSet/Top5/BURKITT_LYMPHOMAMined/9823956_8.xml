<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The C-terminus of the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) of EBV is essential for transformation and the 30-bp deletion detected in this region has been implicated to be associated with a more aggressive malignant phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying EBV pathogenesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> of Turkish children, we analyzed 30-bp deletion and 33-bp variable repeat regions of the LMP-1 gene from paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues of 30 BL patients (mean age 5.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primer pairs spanning the 30-bp deletion and 33-bp repeat regions were designed for amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PCR-amplified products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, Southern blot hybridization, and DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight (93%) of 30 BL biopsy samples were EBV positive as determined by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variable copy numbers (ranging from 4.5 to 7) of the 33-bp repeat of LMP-1 gene were detected in these EBV-containing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine the frequency of the 30-bp deletion of the LMP-1 gene, we sequenced the amplimers encompassing this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analyses of DNA sequence of 28 Turkish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> have disclosed four patterns: the first (32% (9/28)) is identical to B95-8 with no deletion, the second (11% (3/28)) is identical to Asian NPC CAO strain with 30-bp deletion, the third (46% (13/28)) is prevalent in Turkish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> with a longer deletion (69 bp), and the fourth (11% (3/28)) consists of a mixture of 30-bp and 69-bp deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of high frequency of the 69-bp deletion appears to have no correlation with the disease site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mutations found in the CAO strain were also detected in the Turkish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> clustering at the amino acids 322, 334, 338 and 342; whereas mutations specific for Turkish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were clustered at amino acids 326, 352 and 361 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To assess the EBV genotype with the changes in C-terminus of LMP-1 gene, we performed genotyping by PCR to differentiate type A and B strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 28 patients were infected by type A EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Such a high frequency of the larger size (69 bp) deletion has never been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ascertaining the role of this deletion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> pathogenesis will require further study </plain></SENT>
