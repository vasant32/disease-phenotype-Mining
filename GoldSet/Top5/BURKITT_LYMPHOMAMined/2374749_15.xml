<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present here the results on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from this study and other sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> had a relatively high incidence in North Africa and West Asia and a low incidence throughout East Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In populations of predominantly European origin, the highest rates tended to be in warmer countries of lower latitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In industrialised Western countries, the incidence increased steeply with age and was low in childhood compared with that in young adults whereas elsewhere the increase in incidence between childhood and adults aged 20-34 was much less marked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age-distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> in childhood appears to be related to levels of socio-economic development but the total incidence seems to be determined more by ethnic and environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest incidence of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> occurred in tropical Africa and Papua New Guinea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elsewhere, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was rare, though the incidence was higher in Spain, North Africa and the Middle East than in other areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In most Western countries, a third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> may be Burkitt's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no consistent pattern in the incidence of other non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> except for a tendency towards higher rates around the Mediterranean and in some Latin American registries </plain></SENT>
