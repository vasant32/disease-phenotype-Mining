<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancers</z:e> is largely unknown, although the early age at diagnosis has led to particular interest in in utero and perinatal factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Birth weight is the most frequently studied perinatal factor in relation to risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancers</z:e>, and results have been inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the risk of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in children was associated with three measures of the appropriateness of intra-uterine growth: proportion of optimal birth weight (POBW), birth length (POBL) and weight for length (POWFL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 576,633 infants born in Western Australia in 1980-2004 were followed from birth to diagnosis of a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (n = 183) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 84) before age 15, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, or December 31, 2005, and analyzed with Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was little evidence of any association between fetal growth and risk of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, although risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002888'>ependymoma</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085138" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">choroid plexus tumors</z:e> was positively associated with POBL and negatively associated with POWFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of Hodgkin and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> increased with increasing fetal growth among boys only, whereas the increased risk observed with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was only in girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These associations between fetal growth and disease risk were also observed among children not classified as high birth weight, suggesting that accelerated growth is more important than birth weight per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results were similar when cases were compared with their unaffected siblings, suggesting that the increased growth associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk was not general to the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The associations we observed are consistent with causal pathways involving fetal growth factors </plain></SENT>
