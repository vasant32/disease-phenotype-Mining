<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To characterize the molecular features of the t(1;19)(q23;p13) translocation, we molecularly cloned breakpoint DNA from t(1;19)-carrying pre-B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, breakpoints on chromosome 19 occurred within 2 kb of each other in a single intron of the E2A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This clustered arrangement resulted in specific truncation of the E2A gene and transcript, with loss of sequences encoding the basic DNA-binding and HLH dimerization motifs from the derivative 19 chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, breakpoints on chromosome 1 were distributed over a large region and could not be linked to exonic sequences of the PBX1 gene, although identical chromosome 1 sequences are joined to E2A sequences in 1;19 fusion transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data show that the 1;19 translocation consistently results in exchange of 3' exons encoding the HLH motifs of E2A with DNA from chromosome 1 to form a fusion gene on the derivative 19 chromosome </plain></SENT>
