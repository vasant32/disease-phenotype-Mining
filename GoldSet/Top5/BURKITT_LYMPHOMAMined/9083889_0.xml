<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A human monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated mNKES, was generated by fusing B cells isolated from an enlarged cervical lymph node of a patient with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_400'>carotid body tumor</z:mpath> (CBT), with human <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line KR-12 (6TG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reactivity of mNKES was tested by the indirect immunofluorescence method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antigen defined by mNKES was expressed on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines Raji, Daudi, and Ramos and on B lymphoblastoid cell line IM-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, mNKES reacted with T cells stimulated with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) obtained from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, mNKES did not react with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> resting human T, B, or adherent cells (monocytes/macrophages) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the reactivity of mNKES and mouse mAbs recognizing the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>-associated antigen (CD10, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD14, CD16, CD18, CD23, CD28, CD29, CD31, CD43, CD44, CD45RA, CD50, CD54, CD58, CD80, CD102, CD106, and HLA class I, and HLA class II antigen) with various cell lines was compared, mNKES reactivity was found to be unique, not resembling that of any of these mouse mAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, mNKES specifically and rapidly (within 2 hr) induced homotypic cell aggregation of IM-9 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This mNKES-induced cell aggregation was completely blocked by the addition of EDTA and when incubated at 4 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mAbs reactive with CD11a/CD18 (leukocyte function-associated antigen-1; LFA-1) and CD54 (intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1; ICAM-1) completely blocked the IM-9 cell aggregation induced by mNKES, and induction of IM-9 cell aggregation by mNKES was significantly blocked in the presence of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37700">protein kinase C inhibitors</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16393">sphingosine</z:chebi> and H-7 and completely blocked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">cytochalasin</z:chebi> B and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">cytochalasin</z:chebi> D, which inhibit microfilament formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regarding biological function, IM-9 cells bearing surface IgG (sIgG) effectively promoted IgG-secreting activity underlying the homotypic cell aggregation induced by mNKES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The surface antigen recognized by mNKES has a molecular size of about 55 kDa, as determined by immunoblotting analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that mNKES recognizes a novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>-associated antigen distinct from any previously reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>-associated antigens in terms of pattern of cellular distribution and biological function and that mNKES is the first human mAb found that rapidly induces homotypic cell aggregation and effectively promotes the IgG-secreting activity of human B lymphoblastoid cell line IM-9 </plain></SENT>
