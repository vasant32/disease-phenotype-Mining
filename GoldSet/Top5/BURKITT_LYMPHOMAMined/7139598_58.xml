<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 120 hr of continuous exposure to 100 units/ml, interferon beta produced greater than 20% growth inhibition in 22 cells (88%), and interferon alpha produced 20% growth inhibition in 9 cells (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only Daudi (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) cells were consistently more inhibited by interferon alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the other 24 human cells, the effect of interferon beta was greater or equal to interferon alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although no tissue specificity for interferon beta was evident, interferon alpha generally had greater antiproliferative effects in cells of hematopoietic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of interferon alpha was usually established by 72 hr with little further growth inhibition at 120 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, interferon beta often had a greater antiproliferative effect at 120 than at 72 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that various interferons may differ in their biological, cell-regulatory, and clinical effects </plain></SENT>
