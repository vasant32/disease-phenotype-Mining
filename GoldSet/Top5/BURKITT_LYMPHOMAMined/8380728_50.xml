<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine whether the association of EBV with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> showed geographical variation, as in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 32 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> occurring in Peru </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBV DNA-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in situ hybridization was performed using a 30-base biotinylated antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the EBER1 gene of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBV immunohistochemistry was also performed, using a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to the latent membrane protein (LMP1) of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Identification of the precise cellular subset staining with EBV was accomplished via double-labeling with MoAbs directed against Reed-Sternberg cells (LeuM1/CD15) and B cells (L26/CD20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the Reed-Sternberg cells and variants in 30 of the 32 (94%) cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LMP1 expression was identified in 83% of the EBER1-positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Double-labeling studies confirmed the localization of EBV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> to CD15-expressing Hodgkin's cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study found an extremely high prevalence of EBV in Peruvian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, in contrast to the much lower percentage of EBV-associated cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> occurring in "Western" patients </plain></SENT>
