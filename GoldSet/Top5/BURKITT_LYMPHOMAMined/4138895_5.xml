<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Synthetic templates poly(rA).d(pT)(10) and poly(dA).d(pT)(10) were used to detect <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-directed DNA polymerase activity in 100-fold concentrated tissue culture fluids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HVS was monitored by immunofluorescence for early, late, and membrane antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MLC-1 cells were exposed to 30 mug of 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine (BUdR) per ml for 24 h and examined daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar experiments used 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine (IUdR) (20 mug/ml) for 30 h or IUdR (20 mug/ml) for 3 days followed by 2% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> for 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of these experiments failed to show any type C virus-like polymerase; however, HVS expression was greatly stimulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BUdR and IUdR enhanced expression of HVS-associated antigens five- to sevenfold, with maximal stimulation being observed 3 to 4 days after removal of the analogue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IUdR-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> treatment was generally less effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although more cells showed HVS antigens, the treatments did not increase cell-free infectious virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that HVS-infected lymphoid cells can be stimulated to express virus in a manner similar to that of the Epstein-Barr virus in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No evidence of type C virus was found in stimulated cultures </plain></SENT>
