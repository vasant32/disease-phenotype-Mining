<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on this, we investigated its in vitro dose- and time-related effect on the malignant B-cell line Raji, derived from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, at different intracellular levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The membrane alteration was estimated by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) release and by flow cytometry; intracellular metabolic energy by determination of the total intracellular LDH activity; total cytosole protein mass by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52101">sulforhodamine B</z:chebi> assay; and cell growth by incorporation of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> into DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant increase of LDH through cell membrane alteration was accompanied by decrease of intracellular metabolized energy and total protein mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha at lower concentrations (125 and 250 pg/ml) significantly induced cell proliferation in comparison with 1,000 pg/ml of TNF-alpha, which induced more cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha induced maximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate up to 30% after 24 h, showing more effects for a necrotic form of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here we reported opposite and diverse effects of TNF-alpha at different intracellular levels in Raji cells, when applied in different assays, showing characteristics for every cellular compartment </plain></SENT>
