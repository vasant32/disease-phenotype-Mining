<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine of 13 cases (69.2%) expressed p53 protein and 7 (53.8%) showed gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On comparing the results of immunostaining and SSCP analysis, there were two cases showing discrepancies between the p53 protein expression and gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 protein expression was observed in only two cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, bax protein was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One case with mutated bax gene showed a lower expression with a reduced frequency of bax-positive cells than the other 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that inactivation of p53 may be closely related to development and/or progression of these NHLs, and that bcl-2 and bax protein may not have a role </plain></SENT>
