<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The yield of antigens was 0.02% of the nuclear 0.01 M <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">Tris</z:chebi>-HCl/pH8 extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the major antigen separated into two adjacent protein spots with molecular weights of 68,000 and an approximate pI of 6.3 (68/6.3 A and 68/6.3 B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A minor antigen had a molecular weight of 61,000 and pI of 6.0 (61/6.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen 125I-labeled <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were obtained from the tryptic digest of the major antigen (68/6.3 A and 68/6.3 B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The amino-acid composition analysis of the purified antigens indicated that the amino acids in the highest content were glycine (15%), glutamic acid (11.6%), and serine (9%); the ratio of acidic to basic amino acids was 1.95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In studies on nucleolytic activity, the purified antigen produced a single-stranded and then a double-stranded cleavage of PM 2 and pBR 322 DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This antigen is the first purified nuclear antigen that reacts with the HeLa-specific nucleolar antibodies </plain></SENT>
