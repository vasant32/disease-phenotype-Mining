<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Antibody-independent activation of the alternative C pathway by human lymphoblastoid cell lines latently infected with EBV has been recognized for some time, although the mechanisms involved and the specific cell surface molecule(s) recognized by the C system have not been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present studies, carried out with the purified proteins of the alternative pathway have addressed these questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activation of the purified proteins of the alternative pathway by Raji lymphoblastoid cells was found to be antibody independent, confirming earlier findings with serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, activation was highly dependent on properdin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In other models properdin has been found to augment alternative pathway activation and to be required for lysis of virus infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecules which activate the alternative pathway provide binding sites on which C3 breakdown by regulatory proteins is impeded; therefore intact C3b accumulates on the activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation studies with either anti-CR2 or anti-C3 have identified CR2, the R for C3d,g and EBV, as a major covalent and noncovalent binding site for C3 deposition on Raji cells during alternative pathway activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Covalently bound C3b was dissociated from CR2 by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15429">hydroxylamine</z:chebi>, indicating attachment via an <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> bond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>C3b binding after activation was not reduced by an anti-CR2 mAb which blocks CR2 R function, indicating that it was probably not mediated by C3d,g R <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on CR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Direct confirmation of the ability of CR2 to trigger the alternative pathway came from studies with purified CR2 which was found to activate the alternative C pathway in serum or in mixtures of the purified proteins of the pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This work provides conclusive evidence that CR2 is a C activator and functions in this capacity on Raji cells </plain></SENT>
