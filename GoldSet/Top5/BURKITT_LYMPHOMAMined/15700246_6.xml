<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> occurs commonly during the treatment for childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence of and risk factors for transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> during induction chemotherapy in Hispanic pediatric patients diagnosed with B-Precursor ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: The study cohort consisted of 155 Hispanic pediatric patients diagnosed with ALL and treated at one of two South Texas pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> centers between 1993 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was defined as &gt; or = 2 glucose determinations of &gt; or = 200 mg/dl during the first 28 days of induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 11.0% of the study cohort developed transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> during induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age and body mass index (BMI) were both positively associated with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Females exhibited a substantially higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> than males, but this association did not reach statistical significance after adjusting for other covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, 100% of those who required insulin were in the 13-18-year age group and reported a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hyperglycemic patients classified as <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &gt; or = 95 centile) were more than twice as likely to have required insulin therapy compared to overweight patients (BMI 85-&lt;95 centile) and three times as likely to have required insulin compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight (BMI &lt; 85 centile) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of chemotherapy-induced transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in the present study cohort is comparable to that reported in previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric ALL</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding is interesting in view of the elevated prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and the underlying dietary behaviors in this Hispanic study cohort </plain></SENT>
