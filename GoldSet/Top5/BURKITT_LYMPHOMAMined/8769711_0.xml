<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using primers specific for conserved domains of each VH-family and a primer universal to the JH-regions, immunoglobulin gene fragments have been amplified from bone marrow aspirate-derived DNA in six cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cloning and sequencing of the amplified fragments revealed the usage of the VH251-family in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VH-families 1 and 3 were used in one case each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient showed abnormal rearrangement with the participation of two JH regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining case a VH6 germline fragment was involved in an apparently abnormal rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the sequence information, clone-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DIG</z:e>-labeled probes were designed and used in subsequent nonradioactive hybridization protocols to estimate the prevalence of residual leukemic cells in the course of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five of the six cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> could be included in the rest cell analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients investigated, residual leukemic cells were detected, independent of whether a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or apparently abnormal rearrangement has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings imply that the prevalence of residual leukemic cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> indicates a high risk of relapse </plain></SENT>
