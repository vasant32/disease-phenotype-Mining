<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study describes two novel cell lines, DUNATIS and SILVANUS, established from B lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Respectively, DUNATIS and SILVANUS display an early pre-B cell and a pre-B <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous DNA replication of both cell lines was strongly inhibited by IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect was directly mediated by IL-4 and exerted through the CD124 IL-4 receptor chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, IL-4 was associated with rapid cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and reduction of cellularity in DUNATIS, whereas these parameters were considerably less pronounced and only observed after longer-term exposure of the SILVANUS cells to IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to these differences, although both cell lines expressed FES oncoprotein, a 100 kDa protein associated with FES was strikingly found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-4 exclusively in DUNATIS cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that IL-4 displays heterogenous effects on leukemic B cell precursors responsive to inhibition of DNA synthesis via IL-4 mediated engagement of the CD124 receptor chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present findings may be of use for appreciation of the effects of IL-4 in B lineage ALL, and the novel cell lines could represent a model for further identification of target molecules in IL-4 signalling </plain></SENT>
