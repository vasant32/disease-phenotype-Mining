<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From April 2003 to June 2006, 21 small babies (each of whom weighed less than 10 kg or was younger than 1 year of age) underwent orthotopic liver transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five were girls and 16 were boys with a mean age of 15.7 +/- 9.3 months (range, 2-24 months); their mean weight at the time of transplantation was 9.8 +/- 3.6 kg (range, 6-16 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> transplants were obtained from a living-related donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left lateral segment was used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transplantations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 3.5% +/- 1.2% (range, 1.5%-6.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the early postoperative period, hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was identified in 4 patients, and a biliary leak was detected in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">portal vein stenosis</z:e> was identified during the late postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the time of this writing, the 17 alive patients (81%) exhibited good graft function at median follow-up of 14.8 +/- 10.9 months (range, 1-39 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients died during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histological examination revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> in 2 patients, and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data confirmed that living-related donors, especially in this age group, provide a reliable source for the organ pool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Satisfactory results can be achieved despite the anatomic handicaps of this age group </plain></SENT>
