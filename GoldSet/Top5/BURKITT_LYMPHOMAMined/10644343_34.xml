<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Both Epstein-Barr <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) and activated Notch transactivate genes by interacting with the transcription factor RBP-Jkappa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein EBNA2 may hence be regarded as a functional equivalent of an activated Notch receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until now, nothing has been known about the physiological role of Notch signaling in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated whether activated Notch can induce the same phenotypic changes as EBNA2 in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor fusion protein of the intracellular part of mouse Notch 1 (mNotch1-IC), mimicking in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> a constitutively active Notch receptor, was stably transfected into the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines BL41-P3HR1 and HH514 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis revealed that the LMP2A gene is induced by Notch-IC in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, whereas increased expression of LMP1 could be detected only if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> was simultaneously added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concerning the cellular genes regulated by EBNA2, Notch-IC was able to upregulate CD21 but not CD23 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin mu (Igmu) expression, which is downregulated by EBNA2, was also negatively regulated by Notch-IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly to EBNA2, Notch-IC was able to repress c-myc expression, which is under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with a t(8;14) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data show that Notch-IC is able to participate in gene regulation in B cells </plain></SENT>
