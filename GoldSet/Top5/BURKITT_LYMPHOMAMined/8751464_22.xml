<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>/AML1 transcripts were found in 14 patients (13%) including three relapsed patients, and were unexceptionally limited to B-lineage ALL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>/AML1 transcripts among B-lineage ALL was 16% (14/86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reciprocal AML1/<z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> transcripts were detected in 12 (86%) of the 14 cases expressing a <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>/AML1 transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three cases, the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene was fused to exon 3 of the AML1 gene, and to exon 2 in the remaining cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the amount of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>/AML1 molecules for the quantification of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>), a plasmid vector which contained either a long <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>/AML1 PCR product (464 bp) or a short one (425 bp) was used as a competitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We amplified <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> obtained from bone marrow (BM) at complete remission or from peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvests in two representative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For one PBSC harvest showing a positive result, a competitive PCR was carried out to quantify the amount of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A 1:4 dilution series of competitor vectors was constructed, and each vector was added to a PCR reaction which contain a constant amount of cDNA obtained from the PBSC harvest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An equivalent point was compared to that of corresponding samples at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using this method, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> in the PBSC harvest was 3.9:10(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results elucidated the incidence, lineage-specificity, and variant forms of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>/AML1 fusion transcripts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Since the percentage of other chromosomal translocations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> is not more than 5%, <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>/AML1 transcript would be the most feasible clone-specific marker for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, our method could be a powerful tool for quantification of the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>/AML1 transcript and for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
