<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The 14;18 chromosome translocation, characteristic of most human follicular B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, juxtaposes the bcl-2 gene with the IgH locus, creating a bcl-2/IgH hybrid gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By mechanisms that are still under investigation, this event increases the cellular levels of the bcl-2 mRNA and thereby induces an overproduction of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 protein which is likely responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an effort to identify potential upregulators of bcl-2 activity in t(14;18) cells, we found, by strand-specific RT-PCR, a bcl-2 antisense transcript that is present in the t(14;18) DOHH2 and SU-DHL-4 but not in the t(14;18)-negative Raji and Jurkat lymphoid cell lines, and thus appears to be dependent on the bcl-2/IgH fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This antisense transcript is a hybrid bc1-2/IgH <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, that originates in the IgH locus, encompasses the t(14;18) fusion site and spans at least the complete 3' UTR region of the bcl-2 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To achieve some insight into its biological function, we treated the t(14;18) DOHH2 cell line with oligonucleotides (ODNs) by specifically targeting the bc1-2/IgH antisense strand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These ODNs lowered bcl-2 gene expression, inhibited neoplastic cell growth by inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We would like to propose the hypothesis that the bc1-2/IgH antisense transcript may contribute, by an unknown mechanism, to upregulation of bcl-2 gene expression in t(14;18) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possibility has been considered that the hybrid antisense transcript mask AU-rich motifs present in the 3' UTR of the bcl-2 mRNA characterized in other genes as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> destabilizing elements </plain></SENT>
