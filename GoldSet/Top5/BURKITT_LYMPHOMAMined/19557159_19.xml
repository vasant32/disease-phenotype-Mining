<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In human B cells infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), latency-associated virus gene products inhibit expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-family member <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> and enhance cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This involves the activities of the EBV nuclear proteins EBNA3A and EBNA3C and appears to be predominantly directed at regulating <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> synthesis, although post-transcriptional regulation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that protein and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> stability make little or no contribution to the EBV-associated repression of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> in latently infected B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, treatment of cells with inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase (HDAC) and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes indicated that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the down-regulation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was initially confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation levels on the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulphite</z:chebi> sequencing of regions within the large CpG island located at the 5' end of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> revealed significant methylation of CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBV-positive, but not EBV-negative B cells examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA samples exhibiting methylation of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> promoter included extracts from a series of explanted EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent analyses of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modification H3K27-Me3 (trimethylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 lysine 27) and CpG methylation at loci throughout the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> promoter suggest that in EBV-positive B cells repression of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> is initially associated with this repressive epigenetic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> mark gradually followed by DNA methylation at CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that latent EBV initiates a chain of events that leads to epigenetic repression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor gene <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> in infected B cells and their progeny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This reprogramming of B cells could have important implications for our understanding of EBV persistence and the pathogenesis of EBV-associated disease, in particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
