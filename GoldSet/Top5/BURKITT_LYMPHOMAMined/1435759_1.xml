<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The association of the human epsilon-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene with the nuclear matrix was studied in erythroid and non-erythroid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a high salt method to prepare <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> depleted nuclei we studied the association of variety of fragments covering a 7.8 kb region which contains the human epsilon-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We furthermore studied the association of a set of DNA fragments covering the 13 kb human G gamma/A gamma-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene domain, the 16 kb psi beta/delta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene domain and the 10 kb beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene domain with the nuclear matrix of K562 and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fragments studied are easily released from the nuclear matrix, indicating no specific association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Summarizing our results we could say that a region starting 5.7 kb 5' to the human epsilon-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene and ending 4 kb 3' to the human beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene seems to contain no attachment sites with the nuclear matrix of both erythroid and non-erythroid cells </plain></SENT>
