<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies of spontaneously arising rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytomas</z:e> of the Lou/Wsl strain have shown that Ig switch regions are frequently the targets for c-myc recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, however, we were unable to show recombination of the c-myc with Ig switch regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have cloned the rearranged c-myc fragments from 2 of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, IR209 and IR223, and found that the c-myc recombines with a LINE region in the IR209 and with intron 1 of the epsilon locus in the IR223 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although switch regions are not found at the breakpoints, the sequences at the breakpoints share limited homology with Ig switch recognition sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the switch recombinase enzymes are able to recognize sequences in addition to the defined switch recombination sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the same time, both the LINE and epsilon intron 1 sequences are located within the Ig cluster, providing further evidence for the selection of c-myc activation by Ig sequences in the pathogenesis of rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e>, mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo>, and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
