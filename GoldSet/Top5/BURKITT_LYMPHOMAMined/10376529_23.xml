<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results show that TGFbeta-mediated nuclear fragmentation, observed in the Epstein-Barr virus-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BL41, was abolished in the presence of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47923">tripeptide</z:chebi> caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk or the specific caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-fmk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other apoptotic manifestations such as cell shrinkage, surface phosphatidylserine expression and chromatin condensation were strongly inhibited by zVAD-fmk but only partially by DEVD-fmk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that other caspases in addition to caspase-3 control these apoptotis-associated features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specific activation of caspase-3 during TGFbeta-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was demonstrated by the DEVD-fmk-sensitive expression of the active p17 subunit of caspase-3 and by in vivo cleavage of PARP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, TGFbeta treatment of BL41 promoted the expression of both dephosphorylated and truncated forms of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of caspase-3 activity abolished both nuclear fragmentation and expression of the truncated <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein, without modifying the G1 cell cycle arrest induced by TGFbeta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data thus demonstrate that TGFbeta-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B lymphocytes is dependent on caspase activation and involves caspase-dependent cleavage of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein </plain></SENT>
