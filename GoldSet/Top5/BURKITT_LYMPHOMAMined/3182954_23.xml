<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can be used to reliably amplify sequences of up to 3 kb within hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amplified sequence can then be recognized by hybridization with a specific probe after transfer onto <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53325">nitrocellulose</z:chebi> or nylon paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used PCR to recognize human B-lymphotropic virus (HBLV or HHV-6) specific sequences in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> as well as in the blood of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three specimens of DNA extracted from peripheral blood of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> as well as DNA extracted from various <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> were analysed; 52 out of 63 (83%) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> were found to have amplification of the HHV-6 specific sequence; 2 out of the 63 (3%) had equivocal amplification and 9 (14%) were found to be negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty out of 23 tumors were found to have amplified HBLV-specific sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was positive by Southern hybridization on restriction enzyme digested genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization of clinical specimens using radiolabelled <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> probes or hapten-labelled DNA probes was used to detect the presence of HBLV in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of B cell origin were found to be positive for HBLV </plain></SENT>
