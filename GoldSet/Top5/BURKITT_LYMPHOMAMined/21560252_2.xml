<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with concurrent IGH-BCL2 and c-MYC rearrangements (so-called "double-hit <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>" [DHL]) are a relatively rare, recently described category in the 2008 World Health Organization classification of hematopoietic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Response to chemotherapy and survival are poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed files of cytogenetically documented DHL to identify cytologic features that would allow its possible recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve fine-needle aspirates (FNAs), 2 pleural fluids, and 1 touch imprint of cytogenetically proven DHL were uncovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary DHL was correctly recognized in 3 of 12 FNA cases using Ki-67 staining coupled with a positive bcl-2 result as the basis for performing fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of c-MYC and IGH-BCL2 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remaining FNAs and non-FNA cases were diagnosed as non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten cases had cell block material available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases had high cellularity with a dissociated smear pattern and background lymphoglandular bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cell size ranged from intermediate to large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nuclei were predominantly rounded or slightly irregular in contour; 4 FNAs had markedly cleaved nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some nuclei harbored discrete but small nucleoli, whereas in others coarse chromatin and indistinct or multiple small nucleoli existed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A variable number of mitotic figures, tingible body macrophages, and background apoptotic cells were also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No specific cytomorphologic feature(s) were found to reliably identify DHL using FNA or exfoliative cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A high Ki-67 proliferation index and positive bcl-2 staining (on cytospin slides or cell block material) of cases not conforming to typical Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> should prompt FISH analysis for c-MYC and/or IGH-BCL2 rearrangements to identify DHL, particularly if tissue biopsy is not expected </plain></SENT>
