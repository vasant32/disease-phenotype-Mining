<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the ability of fluoroscopic images obtained during air enemas to depict or exclude lead points of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusceptions</z:hpo> and other abnormalities that require surgical treatment in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical, radiologic, surgical, and pathologic findings were reviewed in 14 patients with lead points or other lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fluoroscopic images failed to depict a lead point in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The air enema easily reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusceptions</z:hpo> with benign lead points in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluoroscopic images depicted pathologic lead points in two patients and were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluoroscopic images failed to depict an abnormality that required surgery in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Successful reduction of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> does not always rule out a lead point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other imaging studies, the patient's condition, and laparotomy may also be necessary to diagnose and treat lead points and other lesions </plain></SENT>
