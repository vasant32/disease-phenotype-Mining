<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our Hospital, there had been no prior published report on this subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the pattern of occurrence of Head and Neck <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> treated in Obafemi Awolowo university Hospitals Complex, Ile Ife, Nigeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: medical records of patients with histopathologically confirmed head and neck <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> over a 10 year period (1989--1998) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: Three hundred and thirteen (313) cases, made up of 184 (59%) males and 129 (41%) females were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common sites for head and neck <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were found to be in the oral cavity (36.8%), the neck (26.8 %), the thyroid (13.7 %), and the esophagus (5.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The paranasal sinuses and the ear were the least affected anatomical sites with one (0.3 %) of cases each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The histopathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> types found in this work were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (40.26%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (25.23%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> (2.6%), while many other minor histopathological variants accounted for 31.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> was the most common in children, while <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was found in, and forms the most common histopathological variant of head and neck <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in the older age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: There is a high incidence of childhood head and neck <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> found in this study in contrast to the Western literature where the highest incidence is found in the older age group and the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Jaw <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> constituted the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> of the oral cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> and thyroid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> are relatively common in our center </plain></SENT>
