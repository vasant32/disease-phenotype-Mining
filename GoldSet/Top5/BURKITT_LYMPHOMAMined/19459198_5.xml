<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: We reviewed records of cases of PTLD post-cardiac transplantation (1990-2007) occurring in our unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 15 episodes in 13 patients including four cases of EBV-driven Burkitt-type disease with t(8;14) translocations presenting with advanced stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first case was treated with a variety of low dose chemotherapy combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite problems during therapy he obtained complete remission, but died from complications of pre-existing cardiac allograft vasculopathy 7 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The subsequent three cases were treated with a UKCCSG low stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> protocol, NHL 9001 and Rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They remain in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the context of PTLD the prognostic significance of advanced stage EBV-driven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e> with the t(8;14) translocation may be different to that in immunocompetent children </plain></SENT>
