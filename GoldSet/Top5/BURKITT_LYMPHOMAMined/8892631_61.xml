<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Studies toward the biologic and molecular understanding of programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> have been stimulated by the recent identification of genes and their products that regulate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A panel of mAbs has been raised against dying cells in the present study by immunizing mice with apoptotic Jurkat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of these Abs, anti-7A6, was found to react with apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using ELISA or flow cytometry, little reactivity of anti-7A6 was observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27729">digitonin</z:chebi>-permeabilized human peripheral blood lymphocytes and a number of hemopoietic cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Ab, however, strongly reacted with these cells when they were induced to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by irradiation or treatment with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell sorting and DNA fragmentation experiments revealed that 7A6-positive cells, but not 7A6-negative cells, had apparent DNA fragments characteristic of cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By immunoblot, under reducing conditions, anti-7A6 detected a 38-kDa protein band in the cell lysates prepared from apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoelectron microscopy showed the 7A6 Ag to be localized to the membrane of mitochondria in apoptotic Jurkat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that anti-7A6 defines a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane protein that appears to be exposed on cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, suggesting that the 7A6 molecule may be involved in the molecular cascade of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
