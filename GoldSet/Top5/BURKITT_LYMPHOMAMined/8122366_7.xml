<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of hormone binding assays, nuclear DNA binding activity, and transactivation assays the response was reduced 5- to 10-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Direct sequence analysis of the expressed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines indicated that the phenotype did not result from mutation of the GR gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By preparing a high-titer polyclonal antiserum against the t-1 region of the human GR, we further showed that the deficient GR response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> is largely reflected in reduced GR steady-state protein levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells compared to LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the level of GR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> varies less between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines and the LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Cp promoter of EBV which normally drives expression of the EBNA gene family in EBV-immortalized LCLs contains a functional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> response element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transfection of GR expression constructs to group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells converted the GR response to approximately LCL levels both with respect to hormone binding and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>-dependent transcription of a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>-dependent promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A modest activation of EBNA-2 expression was seen in some such cell lines, suggesting that the lower GR response contributes to the down-regulation of EBNA expression observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
