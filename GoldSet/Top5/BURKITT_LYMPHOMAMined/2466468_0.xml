<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seroepidemiologic relation between EBV and CCM consisted in significant (compared to healthy subjects and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>) increase in average geometrical titres of antibodies to virus-associated antigens </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to various structural components of myocardium were found, including those to myocardial <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> fibers (for the first time) in 1/3 of the patients </plain></SENT>
