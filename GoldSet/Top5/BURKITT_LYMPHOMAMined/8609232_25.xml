<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By multiparameter flow cytometric measurements of cell recovery after culture on stromal layers, we assessed the growth potential of 70 cases of newly diagnosed B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and related the findings of treatment outcome in a single program of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The numbers of leukemic cells recovered after 7 d of culture ranged from &lt; 1 to 292% (median, 91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The basis of poor cell recoveries from stromal layers appeared to be a propensity of the lymphoblasts to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probability of event-free survival at 4 yr of follow-up was 50 +/- 9% (SE) among patients with higher cell recoveries ( &gt; 91%), and 94 +/- 6% among those with reduced cell recoveries (+/- 91%; P = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of leukemic cell recovery after culture exceeded estimates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other recognized high-risk features and remained the most significant after adjustment with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> competing covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the survival ability of leukemic cells on bone marrow-derived stromal layers reflects <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of the disease and is a powerful, independent predictor of treatment outcome in children with B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
