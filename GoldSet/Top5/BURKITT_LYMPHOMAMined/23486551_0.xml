<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background The metabolic alterations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells represent an opportunity for developing selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the therapeutic potential of ST1326, an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi>-palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A), the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid (FA) import into mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods ST1326 was tested on in vitro and in vivo models of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in which c-myc, which drives cellular demand for FA metabolism, is highly overexpressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed assays to evaluate the effect of ST1326 on proliferation, FA oxidation, and FA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> channeling in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic efficacy of ST1326 was tested by treating Eµ-myc mice (control: n = 29; treatment: n = 24 per group), an established model of c-myc-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiments were performed on spleen-derived c-myc-overexpressing B cells to clarify the role of c-myc in conferring sensitivity to ST1326 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> statistical tests were two-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results ST1326 blocked both long- and short-chain FA oxidation and showed a strong cytotoxic effect on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (on Raji cells at 72 hours: half maximal inhibitory concentration = 8.6 μM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ST1326 treatment induced massive cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation, impairment of proper <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> FA channeling, and reduced availability of cytosolic <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi>, a fundamental substrate for de novo lipogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, treatment with ST1326 in Eµ-myc transgenic mice prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation (P = .01), by selectively impairing the growth of spleen-derived primary B cells overexpressing c-myc (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cells + ST1326 vs Eµ-myc cells + ST1326: 99.75% vs 57.5%, difference = 42.25, 95% confidence interval of difference = 14% to 70%; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions Our data indicate that it is possible to tackle c-myc-driven <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> by altering <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and exploiting the neoplastic cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002555'>addiction</z:mp> to FA oxidation </plain></SENT>
