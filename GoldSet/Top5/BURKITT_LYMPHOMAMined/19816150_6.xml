<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied a series of 16 patients with nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> occurring in patients between 10 and 18 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases were classified according to the 2008 World Health Organization classification criteria, with application of immunohistochemistry for the detection of CD10, BCL-6, and MUM1 proteins to divide the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> into germinal center and nongerminal center types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, TCL1, BCL-2 expression, and the Ki-67 proliferation index were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and c-MYC and BCL2 translocations were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these parameters were correlated with clinical features and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and the germinal center type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> are more prevalent in these young patients (63%), with 37% containing a c-MYC translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 1 case showed a BCL2 translocation, reflecting a double-hit case with features intermediate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found a higher frequency of BCL-2 expression than previously reported, with no direct influence on the outcome of the disease in univariate or multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of TCL1 has not been specifically studied in nodal pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> before; we found a 31% incidence of TCL1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MUM1 expression was observed in 44% of the cases and these positive cases showed a significant negative impact on clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TCL1 is directly and significantly associated with the presence of c-MYC and a high proliferative index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The germinal center and nongerminal center subtypes showed significant differences for both overall survival and disease-free interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>c-MYC translocation was found in 37% of patients, and had a favorable impact on clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that nodal pediatric and adolescent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> are mainly of the germinal center type, with a generally good outcome despite the frequent expression of BCL-2 and the presence of c-MYC translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>TCL1 expression seems to be associated with a good clinical outcome, whereas MUM1 expression predicts a poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
