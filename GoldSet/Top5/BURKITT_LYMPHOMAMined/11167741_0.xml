<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene expression in a series of 31 non-infant pro-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) patients that included 16 cases with the t(4;11) translocation and/or the resultant ALL1/AF4 chimaeric gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen out of 31 cases (51%) were MPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> positive/enzyme negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected in nine out of 16 (56%) and seven out of 15 (47%) patients with and without the ALL1/AF4 fusion transcript respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The comparative study between MPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> positive and negative cases showed statistically significant differences with regard to age and white blood cell (WBC) count, and was 39.5 years vs. 26.3 years (P = 0.016) and 71.4 x 10(9)/l vs. 157.8 x 10(9)/l (P = 0.046) in the MPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> positive and negative groups respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation analysis between MPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, age, WBC count and leukaemic relapse according to the presence/absence of the ALL1/AF4 fusion showed that the statistically significant differences observed in the whole group were related mostly to the ALL1/AF4-positive ALL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In fact, in this latter group, the mean WBC count and patients' age were 85 +/- 79 x 10(9)/l vs. 289.8 +/- 102 x 10(9)/l (P = 0.0005) and 44.8 +/- 15.3 years vs. 26.7 +/- 13.7 years (P = 0.01) in patients with and without MPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It appears, therefore, that the assessment of MPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression enables a further dissection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in apparently homogeneous genetic/immunophenotypic ALL subsets </plain></SENT>
