<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are link between innate and adaptative response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes B express most of the toll-like receptors and they may respond to a broad spectrum of PAMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes B are one of the major lymphocyte populations in secondary lymphoid tissues, where they represent up to 50% of cells population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells are an important element of the defense, largely by using the mechanisms associated with innate response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, lymphocytes B are the site of EBV latency, so Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells can may be a convenient model to study the mechanisms associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aim of study was to determine the expression of TLRs at the m-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> level of in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells treated with ligands for selected TLRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P3HR, Raji and Namalwa cells were stimulated with Pam3 (10 microg/ml), PolyI:C (25 microg/ml), LPS (10 microg/ml) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> virus (MeV, moi 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unstimulated cells and cells treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> (0.5 microg/ml) served as negative and positive controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After incubation, from stimulated and unstimulated cells <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was extracted, RT-PCR reaction was performed and electrophoretic separation was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The intensity (INT) of bands were determined using the tools for quantitative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In order to analyze the expression of TLR genes, INT values for TLR2, TLR3 and TLR4 in tested cell lines are expressed as %, assuming an average level of GAPDH expression as 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 25% of INT for negative control was accepted as a change in expression level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It was found that the expression of Toll-like receptors in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells is diverse both in terms of cell type and the type of stimulation </plain></SENT>
