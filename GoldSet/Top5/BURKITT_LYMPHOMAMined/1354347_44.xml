<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) are expressed in EBV-immortalized human B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has previously been shown that transfection of the LMP1 and EBNA2 genes into Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines results in the up-regulation of CD23, CD21, ICAM-1 and LFA-1 cell-surface proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the effects of transient expression of the LMP1 and EBNA2 genes were studied in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> primary human B cells pretreated with UV-inactivated EBV particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To identify and purify cells which express the transfected DNA we used a gene encoding a surface molecule, CD2, as a co-transfection marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that transient expression of the LMP1 gene, from heterologous promoters, is sufficient to induce cellular enlargement and up-regulation of surface expression of the activation markers CD23, CD21, ICAM-1 and LFA-1 in primary B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, we show that transient expression of the LMP1 gene is sufficient to induce DNA synthesis in human primary B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transient EBNA2 expression enhanced the effect of transient LMP1 expression on CD21 and CD23 cell-surface expression but, under our experimental conditions, inhibited the induction of DNA synthesis by LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that activation of primary B cells with inactivated EBV particles, followed by transient expression of only two <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes, EBNA2 and LMP1, is sufficient to reconstitute some of the early events of B-cell immortalization by EBV </plain></SENT>
