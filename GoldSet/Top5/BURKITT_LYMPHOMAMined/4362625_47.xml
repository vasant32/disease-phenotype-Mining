<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The S-1 period was previously identified as the critical period for virus activation induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> analogues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The findings reported here and elsewhere are consistent with the proposal that: (i) virus activation is initiated at or near the site of association of the resident <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome with cell DNA, (ii) replication of the resident virus genome in nonactivated cells is under cell control mechanisms, and (iii) the resident virus genome is physically associated with early replicating cell DNA </plain></SENT>
