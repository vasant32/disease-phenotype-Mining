<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similarly prepared extracts of noninduced P3HR-1 cells gave no precipitation lines with the antibody-positive sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The composition of the precipitates was analyzed by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE and compared with immunoprecipitates obtained by indirect immunoprecipitation in solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three lines precipitated on the Ouchterlony plate were analyzed; these lines were located at close (a), intermediate (b), and distant (c) positions in relation to the antigen well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Precipitate (a) contained <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> with molecular weights of 165,000 (165K), 152K, 138K, 134K, 103K, and 55K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Precipitate (b) contained 152K and 138K as the major components, while 55K was relatively underrepresented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Precipitate (c) contained 90K and 55K as major components, while 152K was a minor component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The method is suitable for the study of possible subtype differences between defined antigenic components of the early and late EBV-determined antigen complexes </plain></SENT>
