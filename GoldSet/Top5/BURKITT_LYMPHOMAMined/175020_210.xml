<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Stimulated by a report on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003261'>elevated IgA</z:hpo> levels in nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC), we tested a total of 372 sera from patients with NPC, other <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of head and neck or elsewhere, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (IM) or healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sera were titrated in indirect immunofluorescence tests for IgA antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) capsid antigen (VCA) and to the diffuse (D) or restricted (R) components of the EBV-induced early antigen (EA) complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results proved NPC to be outstanding in that prior to therapy 93% of the patients tested revealed IgA antibodies to VCA and 73% to D, often at high titers which occasionally matched the corresponding IgG antibody levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EBV-specific IgA titers increased from stages I or II to stages III or IV; i.e. with the total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, many of the NPC patients examined 2-6 years after initial therapy had only low levels of EBV-specific IgA or none at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, and the majority of those with high titers were known to have residual or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to untreated NPC patients, less than 5% of 73 patients with other <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> or of 76 healthy donors revealed VCA-specific IgA and even fewer EA-specific IgA; only 28% and 4% of 54 BL patients tested at admission had IgA antibodies to VCA and R, respectively, and 38% and 3% of 37 IM patients showed transient VCA- or D-specific IgA responses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> at generally low titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While sera from untreated NPC patients often contained IgA antibodies also to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> type 1 virus, their incidence and range of low titers were similar to those obtained with sera from patients with other <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> or from healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It thus appears that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003261'>elevated IgA</z:hpo> levels in NPC might be due to EBV-specific antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Possible reasons for this unique response in NPC have been discussed </plain></SENT>
