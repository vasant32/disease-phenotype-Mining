<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CPAF was tested for effects on the Raji lymphoblast PAF receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Binding studies conducted at 4 degrees C demonstrated specific binding that reached saturation within 60-80 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scatchard analysis of CPAF binding data revealed a single class of CPAF binding sites (14,800/cell) with a K = 2.9 +/- 0.9 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Competition binding studies with PAF indicated that CPAF has about one-third the potency of native PAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike PAF, however, CPAF was not significantly metabolized by Raji lymphoblasts at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CPAF was shown to have PAF-agonistic qualities, since 100 pM to 1 microM CPAF increased free intracellular calcium in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The structurally dissimilar PAF receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> CV-6209 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2611">alprazolam</z:chebi> inhibited the CPAF-induced calcium changes at doses that competed with CPAF binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment of Raji lymphoblasts with PAF or CPAF (10 pM-1 microM) did not affect spontaneous proliferation, suggesting that the PAF receptor is not involved in the proliferative process in this cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that CPAF is a metabolically stable lymphoblast PAF receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> that may provide a useful tool in the further elucidation of the role of PAF in lymphocyte function </plain></SENT>
