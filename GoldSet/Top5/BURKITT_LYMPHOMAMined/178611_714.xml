<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the cell line was identical to that of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> from which the line was derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) carrying diploid lymphoblastoid cell lines unrelated to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> population often become established in vitro from non-Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> explants, several parameters were studied to discriminate the U-937 from such lines: <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in vitro, growth characteristics, cytochemistry, surface receptor pattern, Ig production, lysozyme production, beta2-microglobulin production, presence of EBV genome and karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these respects U-937 differed from prototype lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histiocytic origin of the cell line was shown by its capacity for lysozyme production and the strong esterase activity (naphtol AS-D <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> esterase inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28741">NaF</z:chebi>) of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is therefore concluded that the U-937 is a neoplastic, histiocytic cell line </plain></SENT>
