<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The usual translocation t(8;14) (q24;q32) was found in five of them, a deletion del(8) (q24 leads to qter) in another one, while four variants were observed, two of these having a t(2;8) (p12;q24) translocation and two a t(8;22) (q24;q11) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other chromosome abnormalities were seen in seven of the cell lines, but these varied from one cell line to another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, variant translocations, such as we describe here, are found in endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of these variants are identical to those previously identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> from nonendemic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The common chromosome abnormality of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines was a rearrangement of the 8q24 band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The role of this constant cytogenetic change remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
