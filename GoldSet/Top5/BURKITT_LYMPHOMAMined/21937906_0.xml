<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 2005 World Health Organization-European Organization for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (WHO-EORTC) classification scheme segregated cutaneous B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> into 3 groups: primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, primary cutaneous follicle center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PCDLBCL), "leg type" (PCDLBCL-LT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the WHO-EORTC classification scheme utilized the term PCLBCL "other" not otherwise specified (NOS) type for rare cases of PCLBCL not belonging to either the "leg type" or the primary cutaneous follicle center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we retrospectively assessed the histomorphologic features of 79 cases of PCDLBCLs, including those of "leg type" and "other" NOS type, to further categorize the histologic spectrum of these unusual cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histologic diagnosis of PCLBCL usually poses little diagnostic difficulty; however, some cases may adopt unusual or unfamiliar appearances mimicking other <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> or other malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine cases, occurring in 37 men and 42 women, aged 34-94 years, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three cases were classified as "leg type" and 26 cases were classified as "other" NOS type using the WHO-EORTC classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 53 cases classified as "leg type," 33 were women and 20 were men; of the 26 cases of "other" NOS type, 9 were women and 17 were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the "leg type" category, 31 cases were located on the lower extremities, 5 cases on the face, 5 cases on the arm, 3 cases on the chest, 2 cases on the shoulder, 2 cases on the back, 1 case on the trunk, 1 case on the buttock, 1 case on the supraclavicular area, 1 case on the head, and 1 case on the flank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the "other" NOS type category, 8 cases were located on the face, 5 cases on the shoulder, 3 cases on the head, 2 cases on the abdomen, 2 cases on the chest, 1 case on the trunk, 1 on the vulva, 1 on the axilla, 1 on the back, 1 on the neck, and 1 on the hip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most cases assessed showed the classic morphologic appearance of PCDLBCL, but cases mimicking Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (starry-sky pattern), natural killer-cell (NK) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e> (epidermotropism), low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, and Merkel cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were encountered in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of these rare histologic patterns can be explained by a bias associated with consultation practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Careful histologic examination and immunohistochemical stains were used to establish the correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The differential diagnosis of PCDLBCL is broad and difficult to define histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of these rare histologic variants is necessary to avoid misinterpretation of these cases as nonlymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
