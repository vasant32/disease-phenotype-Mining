<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear, however, whether circulating human peripheral blood gamma delta T cells can be driven into Th1 or Th2 cells by modulation of the priming cytokine milieu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, peripheral blood gamma delta T cells were stimulated by phosphoantigen (isopentenyl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi>) or Daudi <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in the presence of Th1-priming (rIL-12, anti-IL-4 Ab) or Th2-priming (rIL-4, anti-IL-12 Ab) conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Single-cell analysis of cytokine secretion (IFN-gamma and IL-4) was performed by flow cytometry after 18 h and after restimulation of expanded gamma delta T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The early activation of resting gamma delta T cells was characterized by the induction of IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Priming under Th1 conditions induced a Th1 profile characterized by increased secretion of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, while Th2 conditions caused increased production of IL-4 (Th2 profile) by the gamma delta T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the major subset of human gamma delta T cells can be polarized into either Th1 or Th2 cytokine pattern depending on the cytokine milieu in which contact with antigen occurs </plain></SENT>
