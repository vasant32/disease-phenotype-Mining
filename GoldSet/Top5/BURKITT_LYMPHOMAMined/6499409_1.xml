<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32095">Retinolacetate</z:chebi> significantly increased NCC activity against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">chromium-51</z:chebi> labeled human B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> target cells (NC-37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preincubation (treatment prior to adding the labeled target cells) of NCC for 4 to 8 h in 10(-3) to 10(-12) M concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32095">retinolacetate</z:chebi> produced significant increases in NCC activity compared to treatment during the killing assay only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar experiments with different concentrations of poly I:C had no NCC augmenting effects when tested by adding poly I:C either during preincubation periods or during the cytotoxicity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32095">Retinolacetate</z:chebi> probably produces positive modulation of cytotoxicity by increasing the killing effectiveness of individual NCC, rather than recruiting larger numbers of cytolytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies were also conducted by injecting catfish (i.p.) with 1 X, 3X and 5X the daily recommended vitamin A dosages and determining NCC activity after 24, 48 and 72 h treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 1X dose significantly increased NCC activity at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This increase was not transient because NCC activity after 33-37 days' treatment was significantly higher than controls in the 1X, 2X and 3X groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal injections of fish with poly I:C produced no significant increases in NCC activity at 24 or 72 h post-inoculation </plain></SENT>
