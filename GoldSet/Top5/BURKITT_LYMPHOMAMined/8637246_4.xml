<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we present a patient with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, who showed a variant Burkitt's translocation t(2;8)(p12;q24) in addition to t(11;14) during the progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An involvement of chromosome 8q24, the localization of the c-myc gene, has so far been described in only four patients, who seemed to have a fatal clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although no blastic transformation occurred in our patient, no remission could be induce by intensified treatment and survival was only 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case demonstrates that secondary chromosome aberrations can determine the clinical course of patients, even if morphologic and immunophenotypic findings fail to predict the poor outcome </plain></SENT>
