<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the presence of a unique, non-bacteriolytic, c (chicken or conventional type) lysozyme-like protein, SLLP1, in the acrosome of human sperm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C lysozymes are bacteriolytic and can also bind to N-acetylglucosamines linked by beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the invariant residues (17 out of 20), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cysteines, were conserved in SLLP1, but the two catalytic residues E35 and D52 of c lysozymes were replaced with T and N, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The full-length cDNA encodes a protein of 215 aa with a predicted protease cleavage site between A87 and K88 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The processed form of SLLP1, which showed an exon-intron organization similar to human c lysozyme, was the major isoform in the acrosome of ejaculated sperm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As expected, based on its sequence, the mature protein secreted from yeast showed no bacteriolytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease (54%, P &lt; or = 0.001) in the number of sperm bound to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zona</z:e>-free hamster eggs was observed in the presence of antisera to recombinant SLLP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SLLP1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (size, approximately 1 kb) appeared to be expressed only in the testis and in the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The gene SPACA3 encodes SLLP1 and contains five exons at locus 17q11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of its typical c lysozyme-like sequence, genomic organization, conservation of putative substrate-binding sites even in the absence of catalytic residues, and localization in the acrosomal matrix, we hypothesize that, after acrosome reaction, SLLP1 could be a potential receptor for the egg <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> residue N-acetylglucosamine, which is present in the extracellular matrix over the egg plasma membrane, within the perivitelline space, pores of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zona</z:e> pellucida, and cumulus layers </plain></SENT>
