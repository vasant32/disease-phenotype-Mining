<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Here we report a high-resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of the integrated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome in chromosomes, decondensed interphase nuclear chromatin, and linearly extended chromatin fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the EBV DNA integrated into the human genome in the well-characterized Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Namalwa, which contains two complete EBV genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The integration occurs via the terminal repeats of the virus and was always detectable at chromosome band 1p35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the biotinylated BamHIW fragment of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA, we observed distinct pairs of signals or small nuclear <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> "tracks" within interphase nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH to stretched DNA fibers has a higher resolving power and; therefore, enables analysis of the structural organization of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Application of this methodology to linearly extended chromatin of Namalwa cells using different EBV fragments allowed us to visualize the ordered arrangement of the integrated virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the predicted span of 0.34 nm per base pair for relaxed DNA, length measurements of 30 images showed a good correlation between the mean physical length of hybridized EBV DNA of 52.8 microns (158 kb) without the terminal repeats, and the EBV genomic length of 172 kb, including the terminal repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This DNA mapping procedure represents a useful tool for studying the structural organization of integrated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomes, and its application will have implications for the understanding of integration processes </plain></SENT>
