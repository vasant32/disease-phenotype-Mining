<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-2 promoter activation in Jurkat T cells stimulated with superantigen presented by Raji B cells requires CD28 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The addition of rCTLA4Ig, which blocks CD28 binding to its ligand, to the cultures decreased IL-2 promoter activation by &gt;80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, CTLA4Ig did not significantly inhibit the activation of either NF of activated T cells (NFAT) or AP-1 reporters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, activation of NFAT and AP-1 is insufficient for IL-2 promoter activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, an RE/AP reporter was blocked by CTLA4Ig by &gt;90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the requirement for CD28 in IL-2 promoter activation appears to be due to RE/AP and not the NFAT or AP-1 sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, these data suggest that transcriptional activation of RE/AP is not mediated by NFAT, because activation of a NFAT reporter is not affected by the addition of CTLA4Ig </plain></SENT>
