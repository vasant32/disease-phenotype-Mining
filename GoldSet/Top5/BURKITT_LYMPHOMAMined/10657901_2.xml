<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the Myc family of transcription factors is upregulated in many human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, it is unclear which genes are targets for the deregulated Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies suggest that hamster and rat <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17672">carbamoyl phosphate</z:chebi> synthase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> transcarbamylase, dihydroorotase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Cad</z:e> genes are regulated by c-Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In fact, of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> putative target genes thought to be activated by c-Myc, only the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Cad</z:e> gene showed loss of growth regulation in rat cells nullizygous for c-Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it was unknown whether upregulation of CAD, which performs the first three rate-limiting steps of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> biosynthesis, contributes to c-Myc's role in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To explore this possibility, we cloned the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">cad</z:e> promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that c-Myc could bind to an E box in the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">cad</z:e> promoter in gel shift assays and that growth regulated transcription from the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">cad</z:e> promoter was dependent on this c-Myc binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the increased amount of c-Myc found in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines did not lead to increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">cad</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, we suggest that although c-Myc is clearly important for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> transcriptional control of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">cad</z:e> promoter, it is unlikely that increased levels of CAD are important mediators of c-Myc-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an understanding of the mechanism by which overexpressed c-Myc contributes to the development of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> requires the identification of additional c-Myc target genes </plain></SENT>
