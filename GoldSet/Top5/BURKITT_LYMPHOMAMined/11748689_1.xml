<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CS is the major secreted GAG in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines, as well as the major cell-retarded <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> (GAG) in Jurkat and Daudi, whereas HS is the major GAG in the cell membrane of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of mitogenic substances on both synthesis and distribution of GAGs in Jurkat, Daudi and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1, independently of their effect on cell proliferation, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The secretion of CS and HS from Jurkat was significantly suppressed by using 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>), phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> had different effect on the synthesis of cell-associated GAG by Jurkat, depending on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Addition of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) in Daudi's culture medium resulted in increased synthesis of HS, while no effect on CS synthesis was noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the presence of LPS, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 produce slightly lower amounts of CS, whereas this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> significantly suppresses the HS synthesis in both culture medium and cell membrane </plain></SENT>
