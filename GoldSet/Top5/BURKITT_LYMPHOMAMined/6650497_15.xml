<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cloned fragment can therefore serve as a useful marker for gene linkage studies, and the exact location on the gene map is of great interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>pAW-101 was 3H-labeled and hybridized in situ to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, prometaphase chromosome preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the grain distribution shows this fragment to be localized to the long arm of chromosome 14 at band q32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using lymphoid cell lines with 8;14 reciprocal translocations (q24.1;q32.3) from patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we found that the DNA fragment hybridizes to the rearranged chromosome 14 proximal to the breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results localize D14S1 to the region 14q32.1 leads to 32.2 This is consistent with localization of this fragment utilizing somatic cell hybrids and family studies </plain></SENT>
