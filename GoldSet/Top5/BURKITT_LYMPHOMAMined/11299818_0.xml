<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> oncogene 1/interferon-regulatory factor 4 (MUM1/IRF4) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in various malignant human hematopoietic cell lines and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> leukocyte fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to assess expression and chromosomes were examined for anomalies by fluorescent in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 12 cell lines examined, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts were expressed only in B-lymphoblastic and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>Myeloma</z:mp> cells and malignant cell lines derived from mature B cells expressed more transcript than cell lines derived from immature B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcript levels, however, showed no association with chromosomal translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression in B-cell fractions from healthy donors was much less than in the malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, MUM1/IRF4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressed in samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> derived from B cells but not T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that MUM1/IRF4 gene expression is related to stage of differentiation of malignant B cells and they indicated the possibility that the quantitative analysis of MUM1/IRF4 gene is a useful tool for detection of malignant B-cell proliferations in clinical laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
