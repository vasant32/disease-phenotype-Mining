<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The radiation sensitivity of primary clonogenic blasts from 44 children with newly diagnosed B-cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) was analyzed using leukemic progenitor cell (LPC) colony assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The derived values for SF2 (surviving fraction at 200 cGy) and alpha (initial slope of radiation survival curves constructed according to the linear quadratic model) indicated a marked interpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in intrinsic radiation sensitivity of LPC populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SF2 values ranged from 0.01 to 1.00 (median = 0.430; mean +/- SE = 0.47 +/- 0.04), and the alpha values ranged from 0.000 to 3.272 Gy-1 (median = 0.280 Gy-1; mean +/- SE = 0.430 +/- 0.093 Gy-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When CD19+ CD34+ versus CD19+ CD34- immunophenotypes were compared, a trend toward higher SF2 and lower alpha values were observed in LPC from CD34+ patients, consistent with greater radiation resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When patients were divided into three approximately equal groups based on increasing levels of CD34 expression, a clear ordering effect was observed indicating that increased CD34 expression levels are associated with significantly higher radiation resistance at the level of B-lineage LPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest CD34 expression group (&gt; or = 75% positivity) had 1.4-fold higher SF2 (P = 0.05) and twofold lower alpha values (P = 0.06) than the lowest group (&lt; 30% positivity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the CD34 positivity of radiation resistant (alpha &lt; or = 0.2 and SF2 &gt; or = 0.5) B-cell precursor ALL cases was greater than the CD34 positivity of radiation sensitive (alpha &gt; 0.2 and/or SF2 &lt; 0.5) cases (56 +/- 9% versus 34 +/- 9%, P = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas only 6 of 16 (38%) of radiation sensitive cases were CD34+, 11 of 15 (73%) of radiation resistant cases expressed CD34 (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results offer new insights into the inherent and/or acquired radiation resistance of primary clonogenic blasts from B-cell precursor ALL patients </plain></SENT>
