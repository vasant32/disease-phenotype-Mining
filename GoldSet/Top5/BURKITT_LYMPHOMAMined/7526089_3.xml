<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> express the hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen CD34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three proposed models of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human hematopoietic stem cell include CD34+ Thy-1low Lin-, CD34+ CD38-, and CD34+ HLA-DR- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patterns of expression of CD34, Thy-1, CD38, HLA-DR, and multiple lineage-specific antigens on 49 consecutive pediatric B-cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cases submitted for immunophenotyping (36 at first diagnosis, 13 at relapse) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD34+ expression was observed in 67% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD34+ expression correlated with Thy-1low expression and expression of myeloid antigens (p &lt; 0.001 and &lt; 0.025, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CD34+ Thy-1low phenotype was observed in 65% of the cases; the CD34+ CD38- or CD34+ HLA-DR- phenotypes were observed in only three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Examples of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> expression of CD34 and Thy-1 were found in six cases, but CD38 expression was always bright and homogeneous in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data from this analysis indicates that the CD34+ CD38- or CD34+ HLA-DR- phenotypes would be more useful than the CD34+ Thy-1low phenotype for distinguishing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic stem cells from leukemic cells in childhood B-cell precursor ALL </plain></SENT>
