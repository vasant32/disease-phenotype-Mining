<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: An eight-year-old white boy arrived at the pediatric emergency department with complaints of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and distention after an episode of mild abdominal trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physical examination results were significant for diffuse abdominal tenderness and distention, with a large palpable mass in the right quadrants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography revealed a large abdominal mass, and a biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before initiation of chemotherapy, the child developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor lysis syndrome</z:e>, with subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> and cardiorespiratory compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Once the patient was stabilized and sedated on mechanical ventilation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-directed chemotherapy was initiated, and rapid <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> ensued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To control episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, nicardipine was initiated and titrated to achieve the blood pressure goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three days after initiation of nicardipine therapy, the child developed facial swelling and significant, protruding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight days after nicardipine initiation, a tracheotomy was required due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo>; at that time, the patient was converted to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> administered via nasogastric tube for continued blood pressure control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The boy's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> persisted for another 18 days, until a multi-disciplinary drug therapy review resulted in the discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Within one week of the withdrawal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi>, the child's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> was completely resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An eight-year-old boy with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100665'>angioedema</z:hpo> when treated with nicardipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The reaction persisted throughout treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> and resolved quickly after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> was withdrawn </plain></SENT>
