<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Natural killer (NK) cell differentiation from pluripotent CD34(+) human hematopoietic stem cells or oligopotent lymphoid progenitors has already been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, long-term cultures of the CD56(-)/CD34(-) myeloid-like adherent cell fraction (ACF) from umbilical cord blood (UCB), characterized by the expression of CD14(+) as well as other myeloid markers, were set up with flt3 ligand (FL) and interleukin-15 (IL-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The UCB/ACF gradually expressed the CD56 marker, which reached fairly high levels (approximately 90% of the cells were CD56(+)) by day 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FL plus IL-15-driven ACF/CD56(+) cells progressively expressed a mature NK functional program lysing both NK- and lymphokine-activate killer (LAK)-sensitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> targets and producing high levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha, and IL-10 upon stimulation with IL-12 and IL-18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained when highly purified CD14(+) cells from UCB were cultured with FL and IL-15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, UCB/CD34(+) cells cultured under the same conditions showed a delayed expression of CD56 and behaved functionally differently in that they exhibited NK but not LAK cytotoxicity and produced significantly fewer cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kinetic studies on the phenotype of UCB/ACF or UCB/CD14(+) cells cultured in the presence of FL and IL-15 showed a rapid decrease in CD14 expression after day 5, which reached levels of zero by day 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately 60% of the CD56(+) derived from the UCB/ACF or the UCB/CD14(+) cells coexpressed CD14 by day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data support the role of CD14(+) myeloid-like cells within UCB as a novel progenitor for lymphoid NK cells </plain></SENT>
