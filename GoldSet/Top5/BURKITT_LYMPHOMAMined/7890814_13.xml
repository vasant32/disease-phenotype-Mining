<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of the human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) was observed specifically in cells of the granulocyte-macrophage lineage in our earlier reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The specificity of MNDA expression for cells in the granulocyte-macrophage lineage was reexamined in cell lines established from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856536" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Philadelphia chromosome-positive</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell lines that expressed MNDA exhibited myeloid cell features and granulocyte or monocyte differentiation could be induced in vitro, while cell lines exhibiting properties of very early stage cells or multipotential cells did not express MNDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells originating from cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, three lymphoblastoid cell lines (immortalized in vitro with Epstein-Barr virus) were weakly positive and MNDA was up-regulated by interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As we reported previously, MNDA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level in adherent monocytes is elevated by IFN-alpha; in this study, we further assessed MNDA expression in in vitro monocyte-derived macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three additional agents (endotoxin, phytohemagglutinin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi>) and other conditions that affect function, cytokine production, differentiation, and/or growth of monocytes were examined for their ability to alter MNDA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results varied with the agent, cell type, and stage of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes in MNDA expression occurred slowly (hours to days), suggesting that MNDA could mediate changes realized over a long period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results also reveal a discordance in certain MNDA positive cells between steady-state levels or changes in levels of protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> indicating that the regulation of MNDA expression occurs at more than one point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in MNDA expression are consistent with a role in opposing macrophage differentiation and activation of monocytes/macrophages </plain></SENT>
