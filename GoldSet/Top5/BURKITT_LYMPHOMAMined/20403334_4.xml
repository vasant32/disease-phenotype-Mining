<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (Ab) rituximab is accepted to be an effective therapeutic Ab for malignant B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; however, discovery of other cell surface antigens is required for the option of antibody medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering that many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated antigens are <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi>, we have searched glycoconjugates for the candidate antigens that therapeutic Abs target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this end, we first focused on the difference in the glycogenes expression in terms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Akata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using DNA array, flow cytometry and Western blotting, we found that Thy1 was highly expressed in EBV-positive Akata cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, Thy1 was found to be expressed in other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines: BJAB, MutuI, and MutuIII, irrespective of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of these cells with an anti-Thy1 monoclonal antibody inhibited proliferation more strongly than the therapeutic Ab rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines were classified based on the extent of the proliferation inhibition, which was not correlated with the expression level of Thy1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that stable residence of receptor tyrosine kinases in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts sustains cell growth in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
