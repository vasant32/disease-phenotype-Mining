<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven cases of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-involvement were found among 498 patients with NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only 3 of 96 patients with low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> occurring after transformation into high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis of 402 patients with intermediate or high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, lymphoblastic histology (including Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), age &lt;35 years, B-symptoms, stage IV disease, testis involvement and bone marrow involvement were found to be statistically significant risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphoblastic histology was found to be strongly correlated to age younger than 35 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis only lymphoblastic histology, stage IV disease and B-symptoms were found to be significantly associated with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> prophylaxis should be considered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with lymphoblastic histology and in patients with stage IV B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> other than those of low-grade types </plain></SENT>
