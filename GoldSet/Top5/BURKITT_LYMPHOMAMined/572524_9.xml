<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter may be due to the failure of the cells with chromosome aberrations to survive, possibly related to their high sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The increased rate of SCE with <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> treatment was more marked in the neoplastic lymphocytic cells than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ones; the sensitivity of SN1029 and SN1033 cells was 10 times higher and that of B35M and HR1K cells about 5 times higher than that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>-induced high rate of SCE in the neoplastic cells may in some aspects differ from the mechanism(s) leading to chromosome aberrations; and that SCE is a much more sensitive indicator of <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> effects than chromosome aberrations </plain></SENT>
