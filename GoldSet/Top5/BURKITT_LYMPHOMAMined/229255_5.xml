<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> to Raji cells persistently infected with HSV-2 caused a marked increase in virus production and in the number of HSV-producing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the case of HSV-1, it was shown that the addition of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> was required to maintain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1264606" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that control of replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in these cells is regulated by different mechanisms </plain></SENT>
