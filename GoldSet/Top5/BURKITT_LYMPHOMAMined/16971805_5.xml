<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UV3 is a monoclonal antibody that recognizes human CD54 (intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1), and it was generated for the therapy of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a severe combined immunodeficient (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e> of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, UV3 significantly prolonged the survival of mice with either early or advanced stages of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism by which UV3 exerted its antitumor effect remained unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As reported previously UV3 could mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>F(ab)'2 fragments of UV3 had therapeutic efficacy in vivo, suggesting that effector functions were not critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to further define the importance of the Fc portion of UV3 for its antitumor activity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To this end, we examined the effect of an "ultrapure" preparation of UV3 F(ab)'2 to treat <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice xenografted with either ARH-77 cells, a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> cell line, or Daudi cells, a human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we evaluated different doses of UV3 immunoglobulin G (IgG) in these mice to determine the minimum amount of IgG that would produce a therapeutic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data obtained from this study suggest that (1) the Fc portion of UV3 is critical for its antitumor activity in vivo, (2) low levels of UV3 IgG in a preparation of F(ab)'2 fragments account for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of its in vivo activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and most of its activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and (3) UV3 IgG significantly prolongs the survival of <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>/ARH-77 mice as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>/Daudi mice </plain></SENT>
