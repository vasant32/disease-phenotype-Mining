<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several clinical trials have been reported in which monoclonal antibodies (McAb) were used for therapy of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such trials have shown that infusion of McAb recognizing lymphoid antigens, is well-tolerated, and leads to the coating of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the tumoricidal capacity of a McAb is hampered by the presence of circulating free antigen, antigenic modulation, development of human anti-mouse antibodies, emergence of antigen-negative variants of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and the inadequacy of host-effector cell mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have studied the antigenic modulation induced by immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain switch variants of anti-CD19 McAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Modulation of CD19 molecules was not related to the IgG subclass of the McAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence studies on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> cell line Daudi showed that CD19 molecules are internalized after incubation by anti-CD19 McAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Next, the effect of cytoskeleton inhibitors on antigenic modulation was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that antigenic modulation on Daudi cells and on an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line was completely inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27288">vinca alkaloids</z:chebi> (VA) or by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, antigenic modulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from a VA-resistant patient, was not inhibited by VA or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings provide information for the rational design of more effective clinical trials with McAb </plain></SENT>
