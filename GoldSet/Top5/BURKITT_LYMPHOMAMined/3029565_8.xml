<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis showed that FLEB14 delta 3 had a novel reciprocal translocation, t(6;14)(q15;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular cloning of the rearranged DNA fragments and determination of their nucleotide sequence revealed that the recombination event was reciprocal, imprecise, and nonhomologous and took place in the S mu region, like those found in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose a molecular model to explain this genetic event which may be relevant to class switch recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The translocated sequence of chromosome 6 did not contain any known oncogenes, although the sequence is conserved among mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FLEB14 delta 3 did not show tumorigenicity </plain></SENT>
