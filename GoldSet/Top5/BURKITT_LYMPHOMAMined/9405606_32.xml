<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The structure and biosynthesis of poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16153">N-acetyllactosamine</z:chebi> display a dramatic change during development and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16153">N-acetyllactosamines</z:chebi> are also modified by various carbohydrate residues, forming functional <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> such as sialyl Lex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein we describe the isolation and functional expression of a cDNA encoding beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (iGnT), an enzyme that is essential for the formation of poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16153">N-acetyllactosamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this expression cloning, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Namalwa KJM-1 cells were transfected with cDNA libraries derived from human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> and colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transfected Namalwa cells overexpressing the i antigen were continuously selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting because introduced plasmids containing Epstein-Barr virus replication origin can be continuously amplified as episomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sibling selection of plasmids recovered after the third consecutive sorting resulted in a cDNA clone that directs the increased expression of i antigen on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that this protein has a type II membrane protein topology found in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mammalian glycosyltransferases cloned to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>iGnT, however, differs in having the longest transmembrane domain among glycosyltransferases cloned so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The iGnT transcript is highly expressed in fetal brain and kidney and adult brain but expressed ubiquitously in various adult tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of the presumed catalytic domain as a fusion protein with the IgG binding domain of protein A enabled us to demonstrate that the cDNA encodes iGnT, the enzyme responsible for the formation of GlcNAcbeta1 --&gt; 3Galbeta1 --&gt; 4GlcNAc --&gt; R structure and poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16153">N-acetyllactosamine</z:chebi> extension </plain></SENT>
