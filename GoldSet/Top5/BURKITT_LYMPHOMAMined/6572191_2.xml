<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By staining with Coomassie blue, specific protein patterns were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Very similar gel maps were produced by the cytosol proteins of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cells, hairy cells, and of in vitro grown B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein 36/6.2 (molecular weight/isoelectric point), consistently present in these cells, could not be demonstrated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the comparison of control Raji cells--an Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV)-DNA carrying Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line--with Raji cells induced for early antigen (EA) production, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>-methionine-labelled total cell lysates were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the induced cells, an additional protein (100/5.5) was found; this might be one of the immunologically defined EBV-associated antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that two-dimensional mini gel electrophoresis can be useful for the characterization of leukemic cells in addition to the morphological, cytochemical, and surface marker analyses </plain></SENT>
