<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether variants of 5-LO exist in human leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>5-LO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> isoforms that are consistent with alternative splicing were identified by RT-PCR in a cell line or cell type-specific pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> evaluated cells expressed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 exons of 5-LO with the expected splicing sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual isoforms that retained intron 10 (α-10), lacked exon 13 (Δ-13), and lacked exons 10 and 13 (Δ-10,13) or that lacked the first 96 base pairs of exon 10 (Δ-p10) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive bands coeluting with the cloned α-10 and Δ-13 isoforms were measured in primary neutrophils and in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When expressed in HEK293 cells, alternative proteins were without catalytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when coexpressed with the active full-length 5-LO, alternative isoforms significantly decreased the biosynthesis of 5-LO products by up to 44%, as assessed by reverse-phase HPLC analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in stimulated neutrophils the full-length active 5-LO was detected by immunoblot in both nuclear and non-nuclear compartments, while the Δ-13 isoform was only detected in the nuclear fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These alternative 5-LO isoforms may represent a new mechanism for the regulation of the 5-LO pathway and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> mediator biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
