<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined, by Southern blotting, the patterns of chromosomal breakpoint locations in 55 cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) with respect to geography and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have confirmed the association between chromosome 8 breakpoint and geography: 74% of endemic (eBL) but only 9% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (sBL) had breakpoints outside the HindIII fragment encompassing the c-myc gene (P2 less than .00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conversely, not only did 91% of sBL manifest a rearranged HindIII fragment, but at least 56% of these cases, in contrast to 17% of eBL cases, had a breakpoint within the first exon or intron of c-myc (P2 less than .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Breakpoints outside the switch mu (S mu) region (ie, the HindIII fragment encompassing S mu) on chromosome 14 were twice as common overall (73%) as those within S mu (27%), but in the 15 tumors with S mu breakpoints, 13 (87%) had a rearranged c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Breakpoints outside the HindIII fragment encompassing c-myc on chromosome 8 were predominantly associated with non-S mu breakpoints on chromosome 14 (85%) and this was the combination most frequently associated with eBL (65%; 6% of sBL, P2 less than .00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In sBL, the most frequent breakpoint combination was a rearranged c-myc gene with a non-S mu breakpoint (63%; 13% of eBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight percent of sBL and 13% of eBL had breakpoints both within c-myc and within S mu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBV DNA was present in 19 of 20 tumors with breakpoints outside c-myc, in none of 7 with a breakpoint in the immediate 5' region of c-myc, in 4 of 5 tumors with breakpoints in the first exon, and in 7 of 12 tumors with breakpoints in the first intron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the pathogeneses of eBL and sBL differ with regard to the mechanism of c-myc deregulation, and probably also with regard to the state of differentiation of the target cell for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have formulated a testable hypothesis regarding the potential role of EBV in pathogenesis: that it is required to contribute to the deregulation of c-myc in the presence of some, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, types of c-myc damage arising from the chromosomal translocations </plain></SENT>
