<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines, 11 cord blood lymphocyte lines, and 3 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults were examined for complement (C) receptors utilizing fluoresceinated C-coated bacteria (FBC) to determine the optimal conditions for each type of cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Incubation of FBC with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines at 37 and 0.5 degrees C showed that maximal FBC binding at both temperatures was after 120 minutes, and peak reactivity was invariably higher at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These temperature-dependent differences were similar, both in Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA)-positive and EBNA-negative lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBNA-positive lines, however, expressed higher levels of FBC rosettes than EBNA-negative lines at both temperatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, FBC binding to cord blood cell lines after 120-minute incubation was maximal at 0.5 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although similar numbers of FBC rosettes were formed after 30 minutes at both 37 and 0.5 degrees C in cord blood cell lines, rosette formation deteriorated after longer periods of incubation at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The optimal temperature for FBC binding to lymphoblastoid cell lines could not be determined, since bacteria bound spontaneously to these lines at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell lines were also tested simultaneously for sheep erythrocyte-antibody-complement complex (EAC)M and FBC binding at 37 and 0.5 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FBC reactivity under optimal conditions for each type of cell line correlated well with EACM reactivity at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The significance of these results is discussed </plain></SENT>
