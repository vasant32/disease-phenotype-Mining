<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies to determine whether these findings were universal or a consequence of specific cell lines or culture conditions were undertaken in P3HR-1 cultures of identical HLA types from five sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the EBV preparations derived from cell lines cultured at 32, 34, and 35 degrees C transformed cord blood lymphocytes, whereas virus propagated at 37 degrees C did not usually transform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescence revealed that a monoclonal antibody directed against transforming EBV membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> bound to 10-12% of the P3HR-1 cells that had been continuously propagated at 34 degrees C, but the antibody did not bind to the same cells cultured at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although virus expression was completely repressed in transformed cord blood cells, transforming virus could be rescued by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> with nontransforming P3HR-1 EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cells transformed with P3HR-1 virus induced poorly differentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice after seven or eight passages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P3HR-1 cells have the potential to produce detectable quantities of transforming virus remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
