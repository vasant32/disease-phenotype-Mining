<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By this test, as little as 200-300 ng aggregated human gamma globulin or immune complexes per ml serum could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The receptors for IgG Fc on the Raji cells were shown to be inefficient in detecting aggregated human gamma globulin and binding of aggregates to these receptors was inhibited by physiologic concentrations of 7S human IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enhancement of aggregated human gamma globulin binding and binding of immune complexes formed in vitro to Raji cells was observed when the receptors for complement on these cells were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By using the receptors for complement on Raji cells, circulating immune complexes were detected in rabbits with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">serum sickness</z:e>, in mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="LCM">lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection</z:e>, and in humans with immune complex type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Raji cell test may be useful in detecting complement fixing immune complexes in different <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp>, in monitoring circulating complexes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune complex diseases</z:e> and in identifying the antigen(s) responsible for the induction of pathogenic immune complexes in humans and animals </plain></SENT>
