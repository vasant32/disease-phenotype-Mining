<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in the induction of early genes were found between these cell types: whereas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells the trans activator Zta was found to induce key steps of the early lytic cycle, only minor activities of Zta were noted in LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contrary to Zta, the trans activator Rta was found to be highly effective in LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that Rta may play an important role in the activation of the early lytic cycle in LCLs, although it cannot be activated by Zta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter may be a reason for the lower tendency of LCLs to switch into the lytic cycle compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells or differentiated epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
