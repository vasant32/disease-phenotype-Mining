<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cell surface-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> are thought to play a major role as target antigens in cellular cytotoxicity and antiviral immunosurveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One such <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 350 (gp350), which is expressed on both virion envelope and EBV producer cells and carries the virus attachment protein moiety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although it is known that some antibodies to gp350 can neutralize the virus, the role of this <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> in EBV-specific cellular cytotoxicity is not yet clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe here a study in which we successfully used a new approach to demonstrate that gp350 is a target antigen for EBV-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transfection of gp350-negative cells resistant to natural killer (NK) cell activity (i.e., Raji) with a recombinant vector (pZIP-MA) containing the gene encoding the EBV-gp350 and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi> resistance gene enabled us to isolate cell clones with a stable and strong expression of gp350 on their surface membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ADCC determined by using two clones clearly demonstrated that gp350 is the target of the EBV ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this ADCC was comparable to that obtained against the EBV-superinfected (coated) Raji cell expressing the same percentage of gp350 positivity as the two clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No cytotoxic activity was detected against either nontransfected (gp350-negative) Raji cells or cells transfected with the vector [pZIP-neo-SV(X)1] lacking the gp350 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to demonstrating that gp350 is a target molecule for EBV-specific ADCC, our approach in using NK-resistant transfectants provides a lead for probing the role of cell surface-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigens in specific cellular killing and immunosurveillance </plain></SENT>
