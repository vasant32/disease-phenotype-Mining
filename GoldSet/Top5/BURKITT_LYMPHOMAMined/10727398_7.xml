<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared the effects of phosphorylation of Oct-2 protein on its binding to the consensus octamer sequence (ATGCAAAT) and two non-canonical sequences present in human (AAGCAAAT) and murine (AAACAAAT) promoters of the BLR1 (Burkitts' <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> receptor 1) gene encoding chemokine receptor CXCR5 (CXC-chemokine receptor 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter cis-acting elements represent low-affinity recognition sequences for the octamer transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="44658">Okadaic acid</z:chebi> was found to induce hyperphosphorylation of Oct-2 specifically in cells of lymphoid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Potentially phosphorylated amino acid residues localized to the POU-specific domain of Oct-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas binding of Oct-2 to the octamer site from the human BLR1 promoter or to the consensus octamer sequence was unaffected by phosphorylation of this factor, a strong reduction of Oct-2 binding to the octamer site from the murine BLR1 promoter was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding correlates well with the down-regulation of expression of the BLR1 gene in murine splenic cells but not in lymphoid cells of human origin treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44658">okadaic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data support the hypothesis that phosphorylation of Oct-2 may be a mechanism by which activities of the promoters containing non-canonical octamer sequences are differentially regulated in response to extracellular stimuli </plain></SENT>
