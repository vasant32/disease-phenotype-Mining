<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the response in the free intracellular calcium concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i) of Daudi (human lymphoblastoid) cells to antibodies against human immunoglobulins (anti-Ig), and the relationship of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i to anti-Ig-induced capping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 80 microM intracellular quin-2 (a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39442">fluorescent probe</z:chebi> for [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i), anti-Ig (10 micrograms/ml) caused a rapid increase in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i from 100 to 600 nM; the signal returned to baseline with approximately 1 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 450 microM intracellular quin-2, [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i rose to only approximately 250 microM, and the signal declined gradually, returning to base line after greater than 7 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In subsequent experiments, the lower concentrations of quin-2 were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plots of the amplitude of the [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i transients and of the binding of 125I-anti-Ig to Daudi cells versus the concentrations of anti-Ig showed similar saturation kinetics, with half-saturation occurring at 2-3 micrograms/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Part of the calcium in the transient is derived from the extracellular medium, and part from the nonmitochondrial intracellular stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">Caffeine</z:chebi> (4 mM) and 8-(diethylamino)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25657">octyl</z:chebi> 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate HCl (0.5 mM) suppressed the release of calcium from internal stores and the entry of calcium from outside the cells, but permitted capping in more than half of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">Phorbol esters</z:chebi> (1-2 nM) inhibited both capping and the anti-Ig-induced decrease in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of these agents blocked the binding of anti-Ig to the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It appears that receptor capping is not dependent on the anti-Ig-induced transient increase in calcium concentration </plain></SENT>
