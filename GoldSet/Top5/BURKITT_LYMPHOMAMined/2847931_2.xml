<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three cell lines produced similarly truncated heavy chains with an apparent molecular mass of 64 kDa instead of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 74 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both the intracellular and secreted forms of the mu chains were similarly truncated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The membrane and the secreted forms of mu <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were shorter than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cDNAs contained a leader sequence, followed by about one third of a variable region (VH), then by the constant region (C mu) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interruption of the variable region took place near the end of the framework region 1 (FR 1) in Ly 47 and JBL2, and within the complementarity determining region 1 (CDR1) in Ly91 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the three lines, the joining between VH and C mu maintained the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> open reading frame throughout the variable and constant regions </plain></SENT>
