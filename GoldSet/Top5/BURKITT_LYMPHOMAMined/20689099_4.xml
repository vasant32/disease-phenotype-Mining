<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether killing defects in CD8(+) CTLs contribute to WAS-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> and susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development remains to be explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CTL lines from WAS patients, generated by repeated stimulation with SAg-loaded B-EBV, displayed reduced production of cytokines (IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) but almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proliferation upon SAg stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although WAS CTLs killed target B cells in a SAg dose-dependent manner, their efficiency was reduced, especially at a low SAg dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic efficiency of WAS CTLs was particularly reduced against tumoral B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WAS CTLs expressed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of lytic molecules and demonstrated efficient exocytosis upon target cell encounter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the lytic granules appeared not to fully polarize toward the center of the CTL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> target cell contact area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the use of a gene therapy lentiviral vector was sufficient to restore efficient cytotoxic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that <z:mp ids='MP_0005078'>CTL dysfunction</z:mp> contributes to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> in WAS patients </plain></SENT>
