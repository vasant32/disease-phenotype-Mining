<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By a cell-specific differential splicing, between the seventh and an additional eighth exon of this gene, two active E <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> of 1.6 and 1.8 kb are produced, along with several longer transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>cDNA clones for the two <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were obtained and their sequences indicate that the human (2'-5') oligo A synthetase gene codes for two forms of the enzyme of mol. wt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>41 000 and 46 000, which differ only by their C-terminal ends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The product of the 1.6-kb <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (E16) has a very hydrophobic C terminus, which is replaced by a longer acidic C-terminal sequence in the 1.8-kb <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> product (E18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The transcriptional start site of the gene was identified and 200 bp of the 5' flanking region were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A strong homology was found between this region of the IFN-activated (2'-5') oligo A synthetase gene and the corresponding region of the human fibroblast IFN-beta 1 gene, whose transcription is also stimulated by IFN priming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gene has two polyadenylation sites which share a common undecanucleotide, but are used in a cell-specific manner to give rise to the 1.6- and 1.8-kb <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
