<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The specific binding of insulin to 7 different Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines containing chromosomal translocations t(8;14), t(8;2) and t(8;22) was markedly decreased when compared to binding to lymphoblastoid cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype derived from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients or the human IM-9 lymphoblastoid line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The number of insulin-binding sites on intact Burkitt cells was decreased by greater than 90% compared to lymphoblastoid cells, with no change in affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This decrease in binding was paralleled by reduced amounts of insulin receptor alpha (Mr 130,000) and beta (Mr 95,000) subunits detected by cell-surface-labelling and insulin receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts, indicating that transcription of receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is decreased in Burkitt cells compared to lymphoblastoid cells and/or that receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is less stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Burkitt cells displayed negligible insulin-stimulated beta subunit auto-phosphorylation, which could reflect either their decreased number of receptors or a defect in signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Structural analysis also revealed that the Burkitt cells had an increase in a precursor form (Mr 210,000) of the receptor, suggesting that decreased expression of the receptor may be associated with defective processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four Burkitt cell lines with t(8;14) also had reductions of 45-100% in expression of class-1 major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of insulin receptors in both Burkitt and lymphoblastoid cells correlated with the expression of class-1 MHC antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was also an inverse correlation between the expression of c-myc and both insulin receptors and class-1 MHC antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As the insulin receptor is absent on resting B cells and is induced after cell activation, the decrease in receptor expression on Burkitt cells may reflect their less activated phenotype compared to lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
