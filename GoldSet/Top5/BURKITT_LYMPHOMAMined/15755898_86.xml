<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to overcome this intrinsic resistance by transducing CD56+CD3- NK cells with chimeric receptors directed against CD19, a molecule widely expressed by malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An abundance of NK cells for transduction was secured by culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells with K562 cells expressing the NK-stimulatory molecules 4-1BB ligand and interleukin 15, which yielded a median greater than 1000-fold expansion of CD56+CD3- cells at 3 weeks of culture, without T-lymphocyte expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of anti-CD19 receptors linked to CD3zeta overcame NK resistance and markedly enhanced NK-cell-mediated killing of leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This result was significantly improved by adding the 4-1BB costimulatory molecule to the chimeric anti-CD19-CD3zeta receptor; the cytotoxicity produced by NK cells expressing this construct uniformly exceeded that of NK cells whose signaling receptors lacked 4-1BB, even when natural cytotoxicity was apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Addition of 4-1BB was also associated with increased cell activation and production of interferon gamma and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that enforced expression of signaling receptors by NK cells might circumvent inhibitory signals, providing a novel means to enhance the effectiveness of allogeneic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
