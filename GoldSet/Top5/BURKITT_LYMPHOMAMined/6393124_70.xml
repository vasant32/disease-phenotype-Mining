<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The proto-oncogene c-myc may play a role in controlling the growth and division of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, and abnormalities of the gene have been implicated in the genesis of a substantial variety of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To facilitate further study of these issues, we developed antisera that permit the identification and isolation of the protein encoded by the human and other mammalian versions of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that c-myc(human) gives rise to at least two phosphoproteins with apparent molecular weights of 62,000 [pp62c-myc(human), the major product] and 66,000 [pp66c-myc(human), produced in smaller quantities and possibly a modified version of the Mr 62,000 protein] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both proteins have relatively short half-lives of approximately equal to 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mouse c-myc encodes similar proteins with molecular weights of 64,000 and 66,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of cells transformed by DNA-mediated gene transfer sustained previous deductions that the entire coding domain of c-myc(human) is contained in the second and third exons of the gene and resolved previous ambiguities by showing that analogous exons specify the entire protein product of c-myc(chicken) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells containing amplification of c-myc(human) produce relatively large amounts of pp62/pp66c-myc(human) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, translocations of c-myc found in cells derived from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> appear merely to sustain expression of c-myc(human) at levels found also in nontumorigenic lymphoblastoid cells, rather than to increase expression of the gene to manifestly abnormal levels </plain></SENT>
