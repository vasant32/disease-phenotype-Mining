<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indeed, p16 and C3dT induced "in vivo" tyrosine phosphorylation of pp105 and "in vitro" proliferation only of CR2-positive and not of CR2-negative cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, p16 and C3dT also induced "in vivo" tyrosine phosphorylation of pp100 and "in vitro" proliferation of only small dense resting B lymphocytes and not other B lymphocyte subpopulations nor T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that induction of pp100 and pp105 phosphorylation by p16 and C3dT could represent an early event associated with expression of CR2 in the regulation of human B lymphocyte proliferation </plain></SENT>
