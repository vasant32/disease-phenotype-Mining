<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With this system, we proved that disruption of EBV latency is initiated by activation of four EBV genes and that protein synthesis is not required prior to activation of latent EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The system should be an in vitro model for studying the mechanism of herpesvirus latency </plain></SENT>
