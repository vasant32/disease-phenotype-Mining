<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been shown previously that interferons (IFNs) -alpha and -beta cause a reduction in the steady-state level of poly(A) c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report we show that the c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> reduction is not mediated by simple changes in the poly-adenylation of either nascent or existing c-myc transcripts, since similar reductions of c-myc sequences were observed in poly(A) and total cellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> preparations from IFN-beta-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the first exon of c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in Daudi cells contains several mutations, suggesting that the germ line configuration of the first exon is not essential for the IFN-beta-mediated regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> reduction was also detected in cells whose protein synthesis was inhibited by more than 95% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4781">emetine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We surmise that neither sustained nor IFN-induced protein synthesis is required for the c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antisera raised against either the carboxy- or amino-terminal c-myc <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> precipitate in Daudi cells proteins of 66,000 and 63,000 daltons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cells treated with IFN-beta, the amounts of these proteins are reduced by 46-74% which is in agreement with the reduction detected at the level of c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
