<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Review of the fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> smears from 15 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002865'>medullary thyroid carcinoma</z:hpo> that were confirmed on histologic sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ages ranged between 31 and 67 years; 10 were female and 5 male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> forms, and two were familial forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight cases were classified as pleomorphic cell type and seven as monomorphic cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The smears revealed round, oval, triangular, polygonal and spindle-shaped cells, intracytoplasmic red granules, occasional intranuclear inclusions, amyloid, binucleated and multinucleated cells, and thick, granular chromatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rare cytologic findings in this study were grape cells, cytoplasmic nippling, elongated cytoplasmic processes, carrot-shaped nuclei, nuclear buddings, mast cell-like cells and a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings were rarely reported before </plain></SENT>
