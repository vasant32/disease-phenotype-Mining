<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> scramblase and aminophospholipid translocase did not participate in SAL-induced PS externalization, we examined the relationship of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as multidrug resistance (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>) 1 P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (MDR1 P-gp) and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-associated protein 1 (MRP1), for translocation of PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (MDR1 P-gp inhibitor) but not MK571 (MRP1 inhibitor) inhibited SAL-induced PS externalization, it was suggested that MDR1 P-gp is involved in this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, SAL activated both of the ABC transporters for efflux of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">rhodamine123</z:chebi> (MDR1 P-gp substrate, Rho123) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51617">5-carboxyfluorescein</z:chebi> diacetate (MRP1 substrate, 5-CFDA) in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, SAL did not activate these two transporters in Gb3-negative cell lines, such as K562 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-resistant K562 cells, involving not only PS externalization but also efflux of Rho123 or 5-CFDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since Gb3 and both transporters in Raji cells are located in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi>-enriched microdomain (GEM), it is suggested that the binding of SAL to Gb3 localized in the GEM specifically induces MDR1 P-gp activation in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
