<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16541">polypeptide chains</z:chebi>, alpha and beta, are associated at the cell surface, and a third chain associates with alpha and beta intracellularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> isolated from the human B-cell line Raji was injected in Xenopus laevis oocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitates of translation products with several monoclonal antibodies revealed the presence of HLA-DR antigens similar to those synthesized in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One monoclonal antibody was able to bind the beta chain after dissociation of the three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16541">polypeptide chains</z:chebi> with detergent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three chains was confirmed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The glycosylation pattern of the three chains was identical to that observed in vivo, as evidenced in studies using tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of alpha chains assembled with beta chains in equimolar ratio was further demonstrated by amino-terminal sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> fraction enriched for the three <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>, encoding alpha, beta, and intracellular chains, was isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This translation-assembly system and the availability of monoclonal antibodies make it possible to assay for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding specific molecules among the multiple human Ia-like antigens </plain></SENT>
