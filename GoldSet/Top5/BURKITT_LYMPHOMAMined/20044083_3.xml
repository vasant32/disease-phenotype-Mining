<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since Golub applied gene expression profiles (GEP) to the molecular classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subtypes for more accurately and reliably clinical diagnosis, a number of studies on GEP-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> classification have been done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the challenges from high dimension and small sample size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> dataset still exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper presents a new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> classification approach based on an ensemble of probabilistic neural network (PNN) and neighborhood rough set model based gene reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Informative genes were initially selected by gene ranking based on an iterative search margin algorithm and then were further refined by gene reduction to select many minimum gene subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, the candidate base PNN classifiers trained by each of the selected gene subsets were integrated by majority voting strategy to construct an ensemble classifier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiments on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> datasets showed that this approach can obtain both high and stable classification performance, which is not too sensitive to the number of initially selected genes and competitive to most existing methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the classification results can be cross-verified in a single biomedical experiment by the selected gene subsets, and biologically experimental results also proved that the genes included in the selected gene subsets are functionally related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, indicating that the performance obtained by the proposed method is convincing </plain></SENT>
