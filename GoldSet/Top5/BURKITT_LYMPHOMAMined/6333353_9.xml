<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines were stimulated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> A23187, phytohemagglutinin (PHA), or both either in the presence of or without <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> (AcCoA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After appropriate stimuli, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines tested released PAF-like material, irrespective of the surface phenotype and of the level of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some cell lines released PAF-like material after stimulation with A23187 (Molt-4, Jurkat, 1301, Raji, FM007), others only if AcCoA was added to A23187 (CCRF/CEM, HUT 78, Daudi, Nalm-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some cases, PHA was capable of enhancing the effect of A23187 (Molt-4, HUT 78, Daudi, IBW4) and finally, in a lymphoblastoid cell line (WT20), the release of PAF-like material was achieved only in the presence of both A23187 and PHA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate for the first time that human lymphoid cells both of B- and of T-cell origin can release a PAF-like material after appropriate stimuli </plain></SENT>
