<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had a 5 year history of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which developed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pre-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The leukemic blasts revealed a karyotype with two translocations, t(8; 14) and t(14; 18), characteristic for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells are TdT positive, do not possess surface immunoglobulin, and they show immunoglobulin gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mu heavy chain and kappa light chain constant (C mu and C kappa) loci are deleted, while the gamma and lambda light chain constant (C gamma and C lambda) region genes are rearranged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both alleles of the heavy chain joining segment (JH) are rearranged on chromosome 14q+, one of them with the bcl-2 oncogene from chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint of the t(14; 18) translocation occurs in the major breakpoint cluster region in the 3' untranslated region of bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On chromosome 8 a c-myc rearrangement was mapped immediately 5' to the c-myc first exon in a region involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data are consistent with our previous hypothesis on the evolution of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>: a rare pre-B cell develops a t(14; 18) translocation during immunoglobulin VDJ joining that results in an expansion of a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> clone carrying an activated bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within the clone of pre-B cells a second translocation, t(8; 14), occurs during heavy chain isotype switching that results in the deregulation of the c-myc involved in the translocation </plain></SENT>
