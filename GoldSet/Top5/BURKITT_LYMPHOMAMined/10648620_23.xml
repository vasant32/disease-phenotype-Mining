<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines (for example, BL41 and Ramos) are extremely sensitive to genotoxic drugs despite being functionally null for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They rapidly undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, largely from G(2)/M of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine labeling experiments showed that although the treated cells can pass through S phase, they are unable to complete cell division, suggesting that a G(2)/M checkpoint is activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50902">genotoxin</z:chebi>-sensitive cells with EBV protects them from both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell cycle arrest, allowing them to complete the division cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a comparison with EBV-immortalized B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (which have functional p53) showed that EBV does not block <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> per se but rather abrogates the activation of, or signalling from, the checkpoint in G(2)/M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, analyses of BL41 and Ramos cells latently infected with P3HR1 mutant virus, which expresses only a subset of the latent <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes, showed that LMP-1, the main antiapoptotic latent protein encoded by EBV, is not involved in the protection afforded here by <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This conclusion was confirmed by analysis of clones of BL41 stably expressing LMP-1 from a transfected plasmid, which respond like the parental cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although steady-state levels of Bcl-2 and related proteins varied between BL41 lines and clones, they did not change significantly during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, nor was the level of any of these anti- or proapoptotic proteins predictive of the outcome of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that a subset of EBV latent gene products can inactivate a cell cycle checkpoint for monitoring the fidelity and timing of cell division and therefore genomic integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is likely to be important in EBV-associated growth transformation of B cells and perhaps <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this study suggests that EBV will be a unique tool for investigating the intimate relationship between cell cycle regulation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
