<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that the endemic (African) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> (North American) forms of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) differ at a molecular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have now extended our studies to the molecular epidemiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in South America, specifically to two climatic regions: temperate (Argentina and Chile) and tropical (Brazil) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined the patterns of chromosomal breakpoint locations in 39 tumors with respect to geography and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The result of these analyses provide further support for the existence of pathogenetically distinct subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in different world regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of breakpoints on chromosome 8 in South American <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (41%) occurred in the immediate flanking region of c-myc, ie, further 5' of the "typical" <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> breakpoints, in the first exon/intron region, and further 3' of the "typical" endemic breakpoints, which are usually distant from c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the distribution of breakpoints on chromosome 14 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from the temperate and tropical regions of South America is similar to that observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, only one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> with an unrearranged c-myc gene joined to the S mu region of chromosome 14 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This combination was also rarely observed in our earlier series and presumably is either less readily generated by the mechanism that mediates 8;14 translocation or requires other, infrequent genetic changes to provide the necessary selective advantage for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of EBV association in South American <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (51%) is also intermediate with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from the United States (30%) and Africa (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No correlation with the breakpoint location on chromosome 8 was discernable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, only 54% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with breakpoint outside c-myc were EBV positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and suggests that any pathogenetic contribution of EBV is not dependent on breakpoint location, but is more likely to complement additional pathogenetic elements that differ in different world regions </plain></SENT>
