<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The classification of primary malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the gastrointestinal tract by their cell of origin has been a subject of great controversy in recent years, with the proportion of histologic subtypes varying substantially in different published series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Much of this controversy was initially due to the widely recognized inherent difficulty of classifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> based on routine histologic sections alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the advent of immunohistochemical techniques has also yielded disparate results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Particularly contentious has been the notion of true histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, which some investigators have claimed to be relatively frequent in the gastrointestinal tract, whereas others doubt whether they exist at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present here a classification of 25 gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> seen in the surgical pathology services of UCLA Hospital and Stanford University Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> previously reported series, we have utilized frozen tissue sections for the performance of immunohistochemical studies, which we and others have found to be far more reliable than the use of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, particularly in detecting monoclonal surface staining of immunoglobulin light- and heavy-chain markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We find that this technique lessens the likelihood of overinterpreting the stains for histiocyte markers (alpha 1-antitrypsin and lysozyme), which are often difficult to read owing to strong positive staining of benign reactive histiocytes within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Utilizing these techniques, we have been able to classify definitely 21 of our 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (84%) as of B-cell origin, whereas none appeared to be histiocytic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that true histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the gastrointestinal tract must be very rare, and we recommend the routine use of frozen tissue sections for more accurate classification of these interesting lesions </plain></SENT>
