<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To dissect intracellular pathways involved in B cell Ag receptor (BCR)-mediated and Fas-induced human B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, we isolated clones of the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Ramos with different <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> sensitivities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Selection for sensitivity to Fas-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> also selected for clones with enhanced BCR <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> sensitivity and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, clones resistant to Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> could still undergo BCR-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the functional phenotypes of these clones, we hypothesized that both receptor-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathways are initially distinct but may eventually converge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, ligation of both Fas and BCR resulted in cleavage of the IL-1beta-converting enzyme/Ced-3-like protease caspase 3 and its substrates Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi> and poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Markedly, qualitative differences in the caspase 3 cleavage pattern induced by Fas or BCR ligation were observed; whereas Fas ligation generated caspase 3 cleavage products of 19/20 and 17 kDa, only the latter cleavage product was found upon BCR cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The caspase inhibitor Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone blocked both Fas- and BCR-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but differentially affected caspase 3 cleavage induced by either stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, overexpression of a Fas-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> domain (FADD) dominant-negative mutant protein was found to inhibit Fas-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> but not BCR-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together our findings imply that Fas and BCR couple, via FADD-dependent and FADD-independent mechanisms, respectively, to distinct proteases upstream of caspase 3 </plain></SENT>
