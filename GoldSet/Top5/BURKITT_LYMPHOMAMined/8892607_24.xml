<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043194" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome</z:e> protein (WASP), which has no homology with any other known protein families, is rich in proline motifs known to contribute to Src homology 3 binding sites </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Tec family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, which include Btk (the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004432'>agammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> gene), Itk, and Tec, is thought to be involved in lymphoid cell signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this work, we show binding of WASP to the Src homology 3 domains of Btk, Itk, Tec, Grb2, and phospholipase C-gamma, which suggests a function for WASP in lymphoid cell signaling </plain></SENT>
