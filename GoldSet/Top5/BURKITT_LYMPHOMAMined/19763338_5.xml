<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The oncogene c-Myc is a promiscuous transcription factor that is thought to regulate the expression of hundreds of genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the contribution of TEs to the c-Myc regulatory network by searching for c-Myc binding sites derived from TEs and by analyzing the expression and function of target genes with nearby TE-derived c-Myc binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are thousands of TE sequences in the human genome that are bound by c-Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A conservative analysis indicated that 816-4564 of these TEs contain canonical c-Myc binding site motifs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>c-Myc binding sites are over-represented among sequences derived from the ancient TE families L2 and MIR, consistent with their preservation by purifying selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genes associated with TE-derived c-Myc binding sites are co-expressed with each other and with c-Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A number of these putative TE-derived c-Myc target genes are differentially expressed between Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells and encode proteins with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite several lines of evidence pointing to their regulation by c-Myc and relevance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, the set of genes identified as TE-derived c-Myc targets does not significantly overlap with two previously characterized c-Myc target gene sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data point to a substantial contribution of TEs to the regulation of human genes by c-Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Genes that are regulated by TE-derived c-Myc binding sites appear to form a distinct c-Myc regulatory subnetwork </plain></SENT>
