<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lack of recognition of EBNA1 has been attributed to a cis-acting inhibitory effect of glycine-alanine repetitive (G-Ar) sequences on the endogenous processing of this antigen through the class I pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we have explored the possibility of targeting EBNA1 through an alternative mechanism using the MHC class II pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using purified EBNA1 protein, we demonstrate here that CD4+ CTL can efficiently recognize EBV-transformed B cells and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells following exogenous sensitization with this antigen, and this immune recognition is not affected by the G-Ar domain within EBNA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the processing mechanism revealed that intracellular loading of class II molecules with an EBNA1 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> occurs through an HLA-DM-independent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results highlight a novel mechanism for immune recognition of EBNA1 and also demonstrate that the G-Ar-mediated protection from processing can be overridden if this antigen is presented through the class II pathway </plain></SENT>
