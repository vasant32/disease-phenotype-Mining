<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Spiro and coworkers found a 35000 dalton membrane protein (p35) expressed abundantly in hairy cells of a subset of white, American patients with hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They subsequently identified p35 to be the human homologue of murine Ii, an electrophoretically invariant protein associated with Ia molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using related analytical techniques, we have studied leukemic cells of two blood and one splenic samples from three Japanese patients with hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and have demonstrated abundance of p35 in the splenic and one of the blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second blood sample was negative for p35 by our method of analysis, but the same hairy cells became positive for p35 at 2 months in culture and negative again at 4 months in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 samples of this patient (fresh hairy cells and cultured cells at 2 and 4 months) remained consistently positive for Ia and for light chain-restricted immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control cells from one each of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were negative for abundant p35 expression after culture as well as in the fresh state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One can conclude that the Japanese form of hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, while varying in several distinct clinical and laboratory features from hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in caucasians, is characterized also by abundant expression of p35 as seen in a subset of white patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, this expression of p35 is developed by hairy leukemic cells in culture initially but is lost upon longer term culture, in parallel with the level of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15193,50562">tartrate</z:chebi>-resistant acid phosphatase reactivity </plain></SENT>
