<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) can repress <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have compared this protective response with a further, well-established effect of IFN-alpha on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of a panel of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines comprising (i) EBV-positive and -negative lines that retain the phenotype of the parental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells and (ii) the prototype IFN-alpha-growth-inhibited line, Daudi, only Daudi cells were found to undergo substantial growth inhibition in response to the cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lines, with the notable exception of Daudi, were protected by IFN-alpha from high-rate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> initiated by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> ionomycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ionomycin failed to elicit an IFN-alpha-repressible apoptotic response in either <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Daudi cells or IFN-resistant sublines that were refractory to the growth-arresting effects of the cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of c-myc protein levels confirmed previous observations that repression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in IFN-alpha-rescuable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells was associated with an early inhibition of myc that was followed by a return to high-level expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly, ionomycin alone induced a comparable transient inhibition of myc protein in Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Daudi cells, but not in IFN-alpha-rescuable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, renewed expression of myc observed after the early, transient down-regulation was followed by sustained down-regulation of the protein, which paralleled <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that long-term <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and repression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> are distinct cellular responses to IFN-alpha </plain></SENT>
