<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A simple technique for raising specific antiserum to the native molecule of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded nuclear antigen-2 (EBNA-2) from Raji cells is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The procedure involves the use of immunoblotting to identify the EBNA-2 polypeptide followed by subsequent excision from an <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-gel and immunization of experimental animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The anti-EBNA-2 antiserum recognized a single <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> of 86-87 kDa on immunoblots prepared from extracts of EBV-positive Raji or B95-8 cells, while it did not react with any proteins form P3HR-1 or Daudi cells, which carry EBNA-2-defective virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method might be applicable to other systems where isolation of purified proteins for immunization is either difficult or unfeasible </plain></SENT>
