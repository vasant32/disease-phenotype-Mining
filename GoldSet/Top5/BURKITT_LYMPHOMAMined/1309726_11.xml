<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the growth characteristics of human B-lymphoid cell lines in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice with the well characterized growth pattern in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice and observed striking differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in the respective hosts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two cell lines derived from the same individual, the Epstein-Barr-virus(EBV)-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 60 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and the autologous EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell line IARC 277 (LCL) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we tested somatic cell hybrids (HYB) of both cell lines, which despite the LCL-like differentiation phenotype show the de-regulated c-myc expression pattern of the parental <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line, assumed to be a critical factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneously (s.c.) injected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells produced local progressively growing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> masses at the injection site without distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in both <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although both mouse strains possess the same genetic background (BALB/c) and differ only in the B-cell sub-set, the growth patterns of the LCL and hybrids were completely different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the regressive behaviour of LCL and hybrids in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice, these lines show invasive and disseminated progressive growth in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peripheral lymph nodes an thymic tissue were preferentially colonized, whereas mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (Peyer's patches and appendix) and spleen were not infiltrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The preferential migration of lymphocytes to certain tissues is termed homing in a syngeneic system and mediated by homing receptors and vascular addressins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The "homing" of LCL and hybrids into lymphoid <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mouse tissue suggests a strong interaction with the endothelial cells of the host </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Detailed phenotypic analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, LCL and 3 different hybrids was performed using an antibody panel against differentiation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall dominance of the LCL phenotype was observed in the hybrids, as indicated by cytology, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, dissemination and the pattern of surface-marker expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The c-myc activation in hybrids does not appear to influence growth behavior </plain></SENT>
