<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Partial or total loss of expression of one or both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>(s) and/or chain(s) was evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-NHL in function of increasing Working Formulation (WF) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> grade, with most defects in the high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, namely the lowest detectability of the ICAM-1 Me14/D12 and LFA-1 alpha chain, the lowest co-expression of ICAM-1 epitopes and LFA-1 chains, and the most frequent simultaneous loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ICAM-1 and LFA-1 profiles overlapped within the low- and intermediate-grades, whereas striking differences between the high-grade subtypes were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, Burkitt's and lymphoblastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> always lost both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> and both chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Large cell, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> occasionally did so, and also showed either uncoordinated expression or co-expression of these constituents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that expression defects of this type may help differentiate malignant from benign lymphoproliferations, and also be involved in the progression of B-NHL, since most are observed in high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, whose ICAM-1 and LFA-1 profiles indicate that their subtypes are the expression of distinct <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell differentiation stages </plain></SENT>
