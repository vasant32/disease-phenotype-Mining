<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here the use of a simple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach to monitor ALL disease activity has been validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the dilution experiments the method revealed a detection sensitivity 0.5% clonal cells in a background of 99.5% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To validate the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene PCH (IgH-PCR) in practice, we monitored the disease activity of 26 adult ALL patients showing a B-cell lineage component in immunophenotyping at the diagnosis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 18 of those 26 patients, an IgH-PCR product could be demonstrated in the samples taken either at diagnosis or in relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These 18 patients were followed with a total of 158 consecutive samples by IgH-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time for the IgH-PCR-positive patients was 13.6 months (range 4 to 26 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven of these patients underwent altogether 18 relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In nine patients (81.8%), ten relapses (55.6%) could be predicted using the IgH-PCR approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean time of IgH-PCR clonality detection, preceding a cytologic relapse, was 9.1 weeks (range 1.0 to 30.7 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It seems that in three patients the predictive value of the IgH-PCR was remarkable, showing a repetitive positivity in spite of a cytologic remission, even one year prior to the relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We find that IgH-PCR provides a straightforward additional tool for monitoring B-cell lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Due to the straightforward technical performance the method has low running costs and it is thus suitable for a routine service laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Even if a negative finding in IgH-PCR does not rule out a forthcoming relapse in the patient, a positive finding is a definitive warning signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients that showed an IgH-PCR clonality in the follow-up samples relapsed sooner or later </plain></SENT>
