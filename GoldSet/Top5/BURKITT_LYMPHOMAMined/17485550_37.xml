<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the end of induction therapy, the 5-year risk of relapse was 5% in 176 children with no detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> and 44% in 108 children with detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> (P &lt; .001), with a linear association of the level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> and subsequent relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recursive partitioning and clinical characteristics identified that the optimal cutoff level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> to predict outcome was 10(-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 5-year risk of relapse was 12% for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> less than one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell per 10(3) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells (low <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) but 72% for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> levels greater than this level (high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) (P &lt; .001) and children with high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> had a 10.5-fold greater risk of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based upon these results we have altered our treatment regimen for children with B-lineage ALL and children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> levels greater than or equal to 10(-3) at the end of 4 weeks of multiagent induction chemotherapy now receive intensified treatment to attempt to decrease their risk of subsequent relapse </plain></SENT>
