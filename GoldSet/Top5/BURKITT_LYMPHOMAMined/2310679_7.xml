<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement of the c-myc oncogene was found in the bone marrow cells only in 5T2 MM transplantation line in a mouse of the 24th generation and in none of the seven other MM of the 5T series which were of earlier generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the mouse 5T MM resembles the human MM very closely, including the absence of consistent structural c-myc oncogene abnormalities, it can serve as a useful experimental model for studies on the aetiopathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
