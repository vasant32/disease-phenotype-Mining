<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the effects of m144 on NK cytotoxicity in vitro, various cell lines were transfected with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> m144 or a chimeric construct in which the cytoplasmic domain of m144 was replaced with green fluorescence protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line Raji expressed a significant level of m144 as determined by anti-m144 mAb binding or the green fluorescence of the fusion protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The level of m144 expression was relatively low compared with that of transfected murine class I MHC Dd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, m144 on Raji cells partially inhibited antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of IL-2-activated NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NK cells from the CMV-susceptible BALB/c as well as those from the resistant C57BL/6 mice were inhibited by m144 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibodies against the known murine NK inhibitory receptors Ly-49A, C, G, and I did not affect the inhibitory effect of m144 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the murine CMV class I MHC homologue m144 partially inhibits NK cells by interacting with a novel inhibitory receptor </plain></SENT>
