<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A variety of drugs have been used to treat B-lymphocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, including both cell cycle-specific (CCS) and non-cell-cycle-specific drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the therapy for such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> is complex and can include both types of drugs, the efficacy of these drugs in inducing cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper we have concentrated on specific CCS drugs and have examined their ability to induce programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>) in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines derived from patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CCS drugs chosen were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> and aphidicolin (active in late G1, early S phase), the topoisomerase poisons <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27656">camptothecin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (S, early G2 phase) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">Taxol</z:chebi> (late G2, M phase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These choices allow comparison of two drugs with differing modes of action for each of the various phases of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the variation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> between drugs that act at the same phase of the cell cycle is negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both S/G2 and G2/M blockers are very potent at inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> whereas G1/S blockers are ineffective in the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, marked kinetic variations in the rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction were observed, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27656">camptothecin</z:chebi> being more rapid in their action than the other agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The order of effectiveness in inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> on a kinetic basis was S/G2 agents &gt;&gt; G2/M agents &gt;&gt; G1/S agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this study we have also found that growth inhibition was induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the CCS agents chosen and by anti-IgM in various Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore c-myc was down-regulated under similar conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was only selectively induced by some of the CCS agents, it implies c-myc expression is associated with growth regulation and c-myc down-regulation is an insufficient condition for the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, cotreatments using the CCS and other agents revealed the following: Cotreatment using two CCS drugs which act at the same stage in the cell cycle showed either no change or only additivity to the effects seen with either agent alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, cotreatment with CCS drugs showed that an inhibitory effect is found between G1/S and G2/M drugs or S/G2 and G2/M drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No effect was found between G1/S and S/G2 drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Anti-IgM, which by itself was capable of inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, was observed to augment <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by very low concentrations of G2/M-acting drugs but it has little effect on G1/S or the S/G2 drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of anti-CD40 or TNF-alpha on anti-IgM-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> did not carry over to an effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction by the CCS agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Thus specific combinations of agents may lead to either enhancement, inhibition, or no interactive effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
