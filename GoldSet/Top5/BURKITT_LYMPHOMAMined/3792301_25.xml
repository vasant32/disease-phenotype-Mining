<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have isolated a human genomic clone for the intermediate filament subunit vimentin with a DNA probe encoding chicken vimentin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show that the gene for this protein exists as a single copy in the haploid human genome and is transcribed into one mature <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> species of 2 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro translation of poly(A)+ <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system showed that vimentin is a major product of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes but not of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extracted from Burkitt cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2-kb vimentin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> can be detected with a DNA probe in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes and in fibroblasts, but not in cell lines derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (JI, JBL2, BJAB, DAUDI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The abundance of vimentin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is correlated with the quantity of vimentin present in the cells, suggesting that the level of expression is regulated by the abundance of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The half-lives of vimentin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were found identical in both fibroblasts and lymphocytes and belong to the class of stable <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
