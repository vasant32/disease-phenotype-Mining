<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article, we report prolonged survival of B-lineage leukemic cells on 'feeder layers' of bone marrow (BM)-derived stromal cells in a serum-free environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 15 of 18 cases of B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), there was a greater than 50% decrease in the number of viable cells after 72 hours of culture in medium alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell loss was preceded by molecular and cellular changes characteristic of programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and was not suppressed by adding interleukin-7 to the tissue culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the use of allogeneic BM stromal cells as feeder layers prevented <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in 10 of 12 cases of ALL, leading to extended survival of the blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This method was not successful when the allogeneic marrow cells were replaced with established cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In six of eight cases in which the numbers of intact CD19+ lymphoblasts were counted by flow cytometry after 7 days of culture, the proportion of such cells recovered in the presence of BM stromal cells was 68.8% to 124.7% (median, 95.3%) of that originally seeded, as opposed to the 0.3% to 15.9% fraction (median, 0.7%) obtained in the absence of stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival requirements of the B-lineage lymphoblasts appeared to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, as cells from 3 of the 18 cases studied showed no signs of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in serum-free tissue culture medium that lacked BM stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The only cells not giving rise to viable cultures were from two hyperdiploid (greater than 50 chromosomes) cases with identical karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The serum-free assay described here can be used to compare the survival requirements of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and leukemic B-cell progenitors as well as to identify the molecules involved in the interaction between BM stroma and immature B cells </plain></SENT>
