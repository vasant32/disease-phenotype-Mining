<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Posttransplantation <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (PTLDs) are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> lymphoid proliferations representing a major complication of solid organ transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study details the clinicopathological and molecular features of 17 B-cell PTLDs observed in a single center series of 988 heart and/or lung transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases were classified according to World Health Organization <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> classification and tested for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), clonality, histogenetic phenotypic (CD10, Bcl-6, MUM1, CD138), and genotypic (immunoglobulin and BCL-6 genes somatic hypermutation) markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This series of 17 PTLDs included: two B-cell monoclonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301361" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polymorphic PTLDs</z:e> and 15 B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334798" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">monomorphic PTLDs</z:e> (13 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>] and 2 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBV was detected in 9/17 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal immunoglobulin variable (IGV) genes rearrangement was documented in 17/17 cases; IGV somatic hypermutation was found in 88% of cases, indicating a prevalent origin from germinal center (GC)-experienced B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using immunophenotypic markers, three histogenetic profiles were identified: a) CD10/bcl-6/MUM1/CD138, mimicking GC B-cells; b) CD10-/bcl-6+/MUM1+/CD138-, reminiscent of B-cells at the latest phases of GC reaction; and c) CD10-/bcl-6-/MUM1+/CD138+/-, consistent with preterminally differentiated B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Correlation between <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, histogenesis, and EBV status demonstrated a high degree of homogeneity in the two GC-related groups, mostly including EBV-negative cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> features; the third group, consisting of post GC EBV-positive cases, was histologically less homogeneous, as it included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301361" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polymorphic PTLDs</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> and anaplastic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The EBV-negative cases with GC histogenetic phenotype showed a slightly better outcome; however, such less aggressive prognostic trend was not confirmed by statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
