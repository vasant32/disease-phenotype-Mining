<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have examined the consequences of translocation on putative control sequences near to the c-myc gene by DNase I hypersensitivity mapping of chromatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is no detectable difference in the pattern of hypersensitivity (compared with the actively transcribed c-myc gene of lymphoblastoid cells) in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells where the translocation point occurs at a considerable distance upstream or downstream of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the translocation occurs near the 5' end of the c-myc gene, resulting in loss of hypersensitive sites, those that remain show the same sensitivity as in lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that translocation has little general effect on the usual pattern of hypersensitive sites near to the c-myc gene but new sites can be observed in some cases in the immunoglobulin region near to the breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These may be sites normally involved in immunoglobulin gene transcription and may exert a subtle effect on the translocated c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
