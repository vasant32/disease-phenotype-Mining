<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had been in good health until 4 months before her <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, when she developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and neurological symptoms attributed to a lesion of the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathologic examination revealed a circumscribed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass in the right parietal lobe, which was shown microscopically to contain two different forms of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histologic features of the peripheral part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> were typical of a Burkitt-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, while the central part showed the features of a reticulum-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cells of the latter type diffusely infiltrated both temporal lobes, the cerebellum, and the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that in the absence of systemic involvement, the Burkitt-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> also could be derived from the primitive reticulum cells of perivascular sheaths </plain></SENT>
