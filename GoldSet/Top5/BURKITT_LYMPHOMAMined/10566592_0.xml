<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This activity is for a large part revealed by their lack of HLA class I antigen expression, allowing their escape from KIR downregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We characterize here a culture variant of the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line Raji, RJ-A3, which is able to promote as efficiently as Daudi cells the outgrowth of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells in cocultures in spite of unchanged HLA class Ia/Ib antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RJ-A3 is resistant to lysis by most Vgamma9/Vdelta2 lines and clones, even those lacking CD9-4/NKG2 and p58, p70 p140 KIR molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, one Vgamma9/Vdelta2 line which can efficiently kill RJ-A3 do so in a TCR-dependent manner since killing is modulated by anti-TCR antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CDR3 sequences of the T cell clones amplified with Daudi and RJ-A3 reveal that some clones can be expanded with both lines while others are expanded preferentially with one or the other but not both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This indicates differences in the antigenic determinants of the two Burkitt's lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of this Raji variant line demonstrates that the stimulatory phenotype for Vgamma9/Vdelta2 cells can be acquired by some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> independently of the loss of class I antigens and comforts the hypothesis of an anti-tumoral function for the Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cell population </plain></SENT>
