<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The basis for mutations at A:T base pairs in immunoglobulin hypermutation and defining how AID interacts with the DNA of the immunoglobulin locus are major aspects of the immunoglobulin mutator mechanism where questions remain unanswered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined the pattern of mutations generated in mice deficient in various DNA repair proteins implicated in A:T mutation and found a previously unappreciated bias at G:C base pairs in spectra from mice simultaneously deficient in DNA mismatch repair and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> DNA glycosylase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This suggests a strand-biased DNA transaction for AID delivery which is then masked by the mechanism that introduces A:T mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we asked if any of the known components of the A:T mutation machinery underscore the basis for the paucity of A:T mutations in the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, Ramos and BL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ramos and BL2 cells were proficient in MSH2/MSH6-mediated mismatch repair, and express high levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, full-length DNA polymerase eta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, Ramos cells have high levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> DNA glycosylase protein and are proficient in base excision repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines may be deficient in an unidentified factor that recruits the machinery necessary for A:T mutation or that AID-mediated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> deamination in these cells may be processed by conventional base excision repair truncating somatic hypermutation at the G:C phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Either scenario suggests that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> deamination by AID is not enough to trigger A:T mutation, and that additional unidentified factors are required for full spectrum hypermutation in vivo </plain></SENT>
