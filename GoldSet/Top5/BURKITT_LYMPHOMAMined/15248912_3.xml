<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The forms of EBV and the expression of EBV genes in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These studies showed that the forms of EBV and the expression of EBV genes are various in different types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there were only a few reports about the expression of EBV genes, especially the lytic genes, in gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study was to determine the expression of EBV latent and lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> genes in gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> at the transcriptional level by RT-PCR and Southern hybridization,and investigate the relationship between EBV-encoded genes and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> of gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> at the molecular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and eighty-five gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and corresponding para-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues were tested for EBV genome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-Southern analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBV-encoded small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> 1 (EBER1) of the PCR positive specimens was determined by in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with positive EBER1 signals was confirmed EBV- associated gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (EBVaGC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR and Southern hybridization were used to determine the expression of nuclear antigen (EBNA) promoters (Qp, Wp and Cp), EBNA 1 and 2,latent membrane protein (LMP) 1, 2A, and 2B and lytic genes (immediate-early genes BZLF1 and BRLF1, early genes BARF1 and BHRF1, late genes BcLF1 and BLLF1) in EBVaGCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 13 EBV positive samples in gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (7.03%), but no EBV positive sample in corresponding para-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The transcripts of Qp were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 13 EBVaGCs tissues, while both Wp and Cp were silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 13 cases expressed EBNA1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, but no EBNA2, LMP1, and LMP2B <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LMP2A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected in 5 of the 13 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the 13 EBVaGCs, 7 exhibited BcLF1 transcript and 2 exhibited BHRF1 transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The transcripts of BZLF1 were detected in 6 cases, and those of BARF1 also in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No BLLF1 and BRLF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were detected in the 13 EBVaGCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The latent pattern of EBV in EBVaGCs corresponds to the latency I or unique latency I/II, intermediate between the latency I and II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Part of lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> genes are expressed in EBVaGCs tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>BARF1 and BHRF1 genes express in part of gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and their roles in gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> need to be further studied </plain></SENT>
