<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis was made at diagnosis in 174 cases of ALL (101 children less than 20 years and 73 adults), excluding Burkitt's ALL (L3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 11 children (11 per cent) insufficient material was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 90, 50 (56 per cent) had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, 20 (22 per cent) a hyperdiploid karyotype, five (6 per cent) a hypodiploid karyotype, 12 (13 per cent) had a translocation (including seven cases of t(1;19] and three had a pseudodiploid karyotype without translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight per cent of patients reached complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median actuarial CR duration was not attained, was 50 months, 13 months, and 11 months respectively in patients with hyperdiploid, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, hypodiploid karyotype and in patients with a translocation, the difference between subgroups being significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a Cox model, cytogenetics were the strongest factor predicting CR duration (p = 0.03) followed by leukocytes (p = 0.04), whereas the presence of 'bulky disease' had a borderline value (p = 0.077) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of note was that 9/17 (53 per cent) patients with a hypodiploid karyotype or a translocation had no 'risk factors' before cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In adults, cytogenetic analysis was unsuccessful in 15 (20 per cent) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 58 cases, 19 (33 per cent) had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, 15 (26 per cent) had a hyperdiploid, one (2 per cent) had a hypodiploid karyotype, 19 (33 per cent) had a translocation (including 12 t(9;22], and four (7 per cent) had a pseudodiploid without translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>73 per cent patients reached CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median actuarial DFS was 12.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in CR rate and CR duration were seen between cytogenetic groups, but median CR duration was slightly longer in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (17 months) and shorter in patients with t(9;22) (8.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only 3/12 of the latter had major risk factors before cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis is important in ALL, especially in patients with otherwise standard risk factors, as it may reveal unexpected translocations or hypodiploidy, which may require a therapeutic reinforcement </plain></SENT>
