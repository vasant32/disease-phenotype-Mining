<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes the induction of ELCS in p53 mutated Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines after treatment with irradiation or the microtubule inhibitor, SK&amp;F 96365 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both treatments evoked similar mitotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, involving metaphase arrest followed by extensive endopolyploidisation and delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, although the kinetics were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that induction of ELCS and nuclear segmentation correlated with the amount and kinetics of M-phase arrest, mitosis restitution and delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of endopolyploid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In metaphases undergoing restitution, ELCS are seen participating in the restoration of the nuclear envelope, mediating the attachment of peripheral chromatin to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In interphase cells, ELCS join nuclear segments, ectopically linking and fusing with heterochromatin regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cells with segmented nuclei, continued DNA replication was observed, along with activation and redistribution of Ku70, suggestive of non-homologous DNA end-joining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Induction of ELCS also parallels the induction of cytoplasmic stacked membrane structures, such as confronting cisternae and annulate lamellae, which participate in the turnover and degeneration of ELCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that arrest at a spindle checkpoint and the uncoupling of mitosis from DNA replication lead to the emergence of ELCS in the resulting endopolyploid cells </plain></SENT>
