<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Loss of p53 renders cells more susceptible to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> oxidant stress induced by oxidant-generating agents such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">motexafin gadolinium</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">MGd</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">MGd</z:chebi> results in low-level p53 expression, making cells more susceptible to oxidant stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were incubated with different concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">MGd</z:chebi> with or without zinc (Zn) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi>, and ROS, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, proteins, and oxidant genes were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">MGd</z:chebi>, with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> and Zn, induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by reduction of p53 protein but not message, and by reduction of p53 downstream targets p21, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase 1 (GPx1), and p53 up-regulated modulator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (PUMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>p53 protein reduction was reversed by MG132, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46742">nutlin-3</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data are consistent with a pathway of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> that is independent of p53-mediated induction of PUMA; the cellular response to reduce p53 represents a cell survival adjustment to ROS-mediated stress </plain></SENT>
