<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study ZAP-70 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry in a spectrum of B-cell lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>; this staining method was compared with flow cytometry, and the relationship of ZAP-70 expression to mutational status and prognosis was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>242 tissue samples from 225 patients with B-cell lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> arising at different maturational stages were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CLL cases (n = 52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgV(H) mutational status was determined in 25 CLL and 12 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ZAP-70 was positive in 34/52 (65%) CLL, 9/31 (31%) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2/7 (29%) lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 3/36 (8%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, 1/23 (4%) marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 1/45 (2%) diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but in none of the 19 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> or the 14 Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An identical ZAP-70 pattern was obtained in six patients with simultaneous biopsies from different sites and in 12 patients with sequential biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry gave identical results in 48 the 52 CLLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one ZAP-70-positive CLL had IgV(H) gene in an unmutated configuration, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one ZAP-70-negative CLL had somatically hypermutated IgV(H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 12 MCLs analysed were ZAP-70 negative regardless of IgV(H) mutational status (4 mutated, 8 unmutated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ZAP-70 positive CLL was associated with a shorter overall survival (median time 103 months vs. 293 months, p = 0.01) and a shorter time to disease progression (median time 26 months vs. 60 months, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ZAP-70 is expressed in several types of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> and is easily detected by immunohistochemistry, providing a useful prognostic marker in patients with CLL from whom no other material is available or when other techniques for its assessment cannot be performed </plain></SENT>
