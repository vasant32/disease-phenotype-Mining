<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the cells infected with the P3HR1 Epstein-Barr virus strain, a deletion mutant that cannot encode Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) or a full-length EBNA-LP, expressed EBNAs1, 3a, 3b, and 3c but were negative for the latent membrane protein (LMP) and showed no change in <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This suggests that EBNA2 and/or EBNA-LP may be required for subsequent expression of LMP in Epstein-Barr virus-infected B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recombinant vectors capable of expressing the B95.8 EBNA2A protein were introduced by electroporation into two P3HR1-converted B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, BL30/P3 and BL41/P3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both cases, stable expression of EBNA2A was accompanied by activation of LMP expression from the resident P3HR1 genome; control transfectants that did not express the EBNA2A protein never showed induction of LMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In further experiments, a recombinant vector capable of expressing the full-length B95.8 EBNA-LP was introduced into the same target lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strong EBNA-LP expression was consistently observed in the transfected clones but was never accompanied by induction of LMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EBNA2A gene transfectants expressing EBNA2A and LMP showed a dramatic change in cell surface and growth phenotype toward a pattern like that of lymphoblastoid cell lines; some but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these changes could be reproduced in the absence of EBNA2A by transfection of P3HR1-converted cell lines with a recombinant vector expressing LMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that EBNA2 plays an important dual role in the process of B-cell activation to the lymphoblastoid phenotype; the protein can have a direct effect upon cellular gene expression and is also involved in activating the expression of a second virus-encoded effector protein, LMP </plain></SENT>
