<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mice lacking the BCL-6 gene product exhibit overexpression of T helper cell type 2 cytokines, and multi-organ <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and infiltration by IgE+ B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated IgE levels appear to result from loss of BCL-6's role in repression of the Stat6-dependent processes of I-epsilon transcription and IgE class-switching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Understanding the regulation of the BCL-6 gene expression is therefore relevant to the allergic response, due to the IgE-dependent activation of mast cells and basophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed a pair of isogenic cell lines that exhibit differential expression of the BCL-6 gene and mapped the control point to transcription using nuclear run-on assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct analyses of the BCL-6 gene and transfection experiments were carried out to map the molecular basis for the differential expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this study, we report that pair of isogenic cell lines exhibits differential expression of BCL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BCL-6 mRNA is barely detectable in Jijoye, a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cell line, but is abundant in Clone-13, a mutant cell line derived from Jijoye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Corresponding to the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level, BCL-6 protein is detected only in Clone-13, but not in Jijoye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nuclear run-on assays indicate that BCL-6 expression is regulated mainly at the transcriptional level in these two cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gene structural alterations are not detected in a region including a 3-kb promoter and the first intron, where most of the chromosomal translocations are observed in diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, multiple, heterozygous point mutations are identified in the first intron, the hypermutation region of BCL-6, in both of the two cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in transient transfection experiments these mutations have no effects on gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the distinct profile of BCL-6 expression in Jijoye/Clone-13 is due to either a missing negative element in a different portion of the gene or that there is an issue of chromatin accessibility operating in BCL-6 gene regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This pair of isogenic cell lines (Jijoye/Clone-13) thus provides a new system to dissect the regulation of BCL-6 gene expression </plain></SENT>
