<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analysed a panel of different Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) for the expression of IL6 and IL6 receptor (IL6R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV) positive or negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines and the corresponding lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), derived from EBV immortalized mononuclear cells of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients, were tested for the expression of IL6 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein by Northern blot experiments and ELISA, and for the expression of the IL6R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein by Northern blot Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that six out of 19 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines produced IL6 constitutively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three cell lines infected with the EBV substrain B95-8 (B95-8 convertants) produced IL6, in contrast to the original EBV negative lines and to the cell lines infected with the EBV substrain P3HR1 (P3HR1 convertants) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The produced IL6 was biologically active as shown by proliferation of the IL6 dependent cell line TEPC 1033 C2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines with the highest level of IL6 production (190 pg/ml and 550 pg/ml) expressed in addition IL6R molecules on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies directed against IL6 did not inhibit the growth of these two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines, thus excluding autocrine stimulation in these lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL6R expression could be further demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> LCLs analysed, in five out of seven EBV positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> and two out of three B95-8 convertants, but only in one out of the six EBV negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that EBV in immortalized B cells and in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells can promote IL6 receptor expression </plain></SENT>
