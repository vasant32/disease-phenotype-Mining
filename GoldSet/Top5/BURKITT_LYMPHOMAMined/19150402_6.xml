<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein (SAP or SH2D1A) is an important regulator of immune function which, when mutated or deleted, causes the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a major phenotype of XLP, it is important to understand the function of SAP in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that SAP is expressed endogenously in mouse splenic B cells, is inducibly expressed in the human BJAB cells, and co-localizes and interacts with CD22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also show that SAP binding to the inhibitory immunoreceptor CD22 regulates calcium mobilization in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, forced expression of SAP leads to constitutive CD22 tyrosine phosphorylation and decreased Ca(2+) response in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis reveals that, in response to IgM cross-linking, the phosphorylation of Syk, Blnk, or PLCgamma2 and their interactions with one another were either diminished or completely abolished in SAP-expressing cells compared to cells that lack SAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively our work identifies a novel role for SAP in B cells and extends its function to inhibitory immunoreceptor signaling and calcium mobilization </plain></SENT>
