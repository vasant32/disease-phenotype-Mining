<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is no obvious correlation between the size of this <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> and any properties of the cells from which it is derived, other than those related to the strain of transforming virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We confirm that the polymorphic region of this molecule is the glycine-alanine <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi> encoded by the third internal repeat of the EBV genome (IR3) and we consider the significance of this domain </plain></SENT>
