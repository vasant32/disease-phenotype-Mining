<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The titer of the crude IFN varied extensively between different batches; part of the variation was caused by a differential expression of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More than 80% of the IFN activity was IFN-beta by several criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A two-step purification procedure was developed and the resulting preparation had a specific activity of approximately 10(6) U/mg protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IFN-beta type was found to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, and could be separated into several components, which probably represented post-translational modifications of one molecule </plain></SENT>
