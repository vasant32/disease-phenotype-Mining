<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 30-year-old, HIV-positive man with a previous history of an atypical nasopharyngeal Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> developed fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity on a routine FDG-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography scan performed 10 months after the completion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This new FDG-<z:chebi fb="156" ids="39214">avid</z:chebi> disease was in the area of his initial disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric assessment of a fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> showed a CD10-expressing B-cell population with kappa predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The corresponding cytology smears had large atypical lymphoid cells along with smaller lymphocytes and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of the patient's previous history of a CD10(+), high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the cytologic and flow cytometric findings were considered highly suspicious for a B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because the differential diagnosis included a relapsed Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> versus a second, unrelated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (the former with a dismal prognosis) it was deemed prudent to obtain more tissue via an open biopsy for confirmation of diagnosis and exact subclassification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An open biopsy, however, revealed a reactive lymph node with enlarged geographic follicles; no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was demonstrable and c-Myc studies were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient remains without evidence of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Retrospectively, the original flow cytometric assessment was believed to likely represent sampling of hyperplastic germinal centers with significantly expanded CD10(+) B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The FDG uptake and the kappa predominance further confounded the interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates the pitfalls of standard diagnostic techniques, including PET scanning, cytology, and flow cytometry, particularly in the setting of HIV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It further underscores the importance of adequate clinical correlation and a low threshold for performing open biopsies in such patients </plain></SENT>
