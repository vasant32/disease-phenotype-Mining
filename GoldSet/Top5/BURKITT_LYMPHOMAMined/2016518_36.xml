<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fusion protein was used as immunogen to obtain mAb to ICAM-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 6D5 antibody was selected by its reactivity in immunofluorescence with the endothelial cell line Eahy926 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antibody precipitated a 55,000 m.w. <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> from radioactivity surface labeled cells and also reacted in Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As measured by immunofluorescence flow cytometry, the antibody reacted with lymphoblastoid B cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> origin, some Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, vascular endothelial cells, the endothelial cell line Eahy926, 4 and a subpopulation of Con A-stimulated blood mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two Ig-like domains of ICAM-2 were separately expressed in E. coli, and the antibody was shown to react with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The antibody inhibited the CD11/CD18-dependent binding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells to transfected COS-1 cells </plain></SENT>
