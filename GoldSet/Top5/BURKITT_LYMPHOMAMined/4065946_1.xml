<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the 256 confirmed ABLR cases have the advantage of uniform pathological review, the ABLR is a relatively 'passive' registry, with the majority of cases being submitted by interested physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in the USA on a population basis, we analysed incidence and survival data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program of the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute (NCI) and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both SEER and NCHS data demonstrated a more marked predominance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in young males than had been found in the ABLR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three sources of data revealed a broad age spectrum and a relative paucity of cases in the non-white US population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SEER data indicate that the overall incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in the USA was 1.4 per million for white males and 0.4 per million for white females during 1973-1981 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate for white males increased over time, perhaps owing to improvements in diagnosis and reporting </plain></SENT>
