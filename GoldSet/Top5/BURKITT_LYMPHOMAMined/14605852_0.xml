<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can be the cause of a hitherto unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> or it is incidentally detected as shown in the three cases under report.1.A 68-year-old man was operated on because of a symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> in his right kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At nephrectomy, a conventional (clear cell) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> was found simultaneously with an occult mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> infiltrating the adjacent renal and extrarenal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up uncovered nodal and bone marrow involvement, so that a primary renal manifestation of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was apparent.2.A 69-year-old man with suspected vertebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> underwent partial renal resection because of a mass in his left kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologically and immunohistochemically, the renal infiltration was diagnosed as a precursor B-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After chemotherapy and irradiation, leukaemic blood cell counts with 50% lymphoblasts proved a primary renal manifestation of precursor B-lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>.3.A 13-year-old boy presented clinically with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000105'>enlarged kidneys</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> urinalysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Renal biopsy showed a diffuse interstitial infiltration with atypical T-lymphoblasts compressing tubules and surrounding preserved glomeruli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent clinical bone marrow smears presented 60% T-lymphoblasts, so that the final diagnosis of a primary renal manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> T-lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> of mature thymic cortex type was made </plain></SENT>
