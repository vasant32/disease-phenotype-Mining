<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from complications of chemotherapy (two infective, one biochemical) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five children with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disease at diagnosis (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>+) received planned additional megatherapy/bone marrow transplants </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with bulky abdominal disease had a 32% EFS at 1 year (CI 13-68%) compared with 76% (CI 39-94%) for those without bulky abdominal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall EFS for eight <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>+ patients is 73% at 1 year (95% CI 34-97%) compared with 48% (95% 24-74%) for those without <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A score of 1 was given for each of the following potential prognostic features: bulky abdominal disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> within 48 h of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who scored 0 or 1 fared significantly better than those who scored 2 or 3 (EFS at 1 year 78% [CI 49-95%] versus 24% [6-65%], P less than 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients with a score of 2 survived past 6 months and another is currently well, but has not regenerated his marrow following autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This protocol is relatively effective for patients who have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, but those patients who have bulky abdominal disease, often associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, and those with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease, do not fare so well and require new approaches to therapy </plain></SENT>
