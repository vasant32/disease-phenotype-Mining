<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, two genes, RAG1 and RAG2, that are able to activate rearrangement of synthetic recombination substrates were cloned in mouse and a human gene homologous to RAG1 was described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To define the differentiation stages corresponding to RAG1 and RAG2 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression, we have studied a large number of B- and T-lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, we show that a human gene homologous to the murine RAG2 is transcribed in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, using a polymerase chain reaction approach, we have shown that RAG are expressed not only in T-cell receptor (TCR)-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0006727'>T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALLs</z:e>), but also in some cases in which a significant percentage of cells expressed surface TCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Absence of RAG expression was shown in certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALLs</z:e> at variable stages of thymic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data obtained in B-lineage ALLs show that RAG <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> are expressed in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> slg- B-lineage ALLs but are not transcribed in the slg+ B-cell proliferations tested, including Burkitt's ALLs, follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with the involvement of RAG in the control of in vivo V-(D)-J recombinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings are also of interest in the delineation of potential regulatory factors acting on RAG transcription and in the understanding of the mechanisms of specific chromosomal abnormalities occurring in immature lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
