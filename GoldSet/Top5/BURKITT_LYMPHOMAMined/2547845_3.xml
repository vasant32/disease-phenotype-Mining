<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty three cases with benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathies</z:hpo> were analysed in a similar way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Except for endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were diploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Near-diploid <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> (with a DNA index ranging from 1.06 to 1.26) was also found in endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as well as in six non-endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and in eight cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> but was absent in nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tetraploid <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was seen in three cases of nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of the 23 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> also showed near-diploid DNA, one of which subsequently developed into a non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that near-diploid DNA content seems to be associated with the lymphatic origins of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> rather than with EBV </plain></SENT>
