<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD40 is present on both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic B-lineage cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD40 stimulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells has been shown to promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth and differentiation, whereas aggressive histology B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are growth inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of neoplastic B-cell growth is believed to occur via activation-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in which stimuli that typically promote the growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells prevent the growth of their neoplastic counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show here that CD40 stimulation using either a soluble recombinant human CD40 ligand (srhCD40L) or anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody resulted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional studies examining the mechanism of CD40-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> revealed an increase in bax <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> with a subsequent increase in Bax protein in the mitochondria of the treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro exposure of the cells to bax antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a significant decline in Bax protein levels and partial protection from CD40-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, indicating that induction of Bax was at least one mechanism underlying this inhibitory effect of CD40 stimulation on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When immunodeficient mice bearing Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated with srhCD40L, significant increases in survival were observed indicating a direct antitumor effect as a result of CD40 stimulation in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results demonstrate that CD40 ligation of aggressive histology B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells results in inhibition both in vitro and in vivo and thus may be of potential clinical use in their treatment </plain></SENT>
