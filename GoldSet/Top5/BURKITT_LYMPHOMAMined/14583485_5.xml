<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous work has shown that Bz-423 ameliorates disease in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> that also have features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the effects of Bz-423 against a group of malignant B-cell lines derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These experiments demonstrate that Bz-423 has cytotoxic activity against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-cell lines tested, regardless of EBV status or Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to its cytotoxic properties, we found that Bz-423 is also a potent antiproliferative agent that induces a G(1)-phase arrest independent of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, both the cytotoxicity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> are mediated by increased reactive oxygen species levels and appear independent of binding to the peripheral <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This work further defines the biological activities of Bz-423 that are consistent with those of other compounds in clinical development for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> therapies </plain></SENT>
