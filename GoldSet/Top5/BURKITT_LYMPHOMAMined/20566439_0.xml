<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the northeast of region in Brazil its latex is used as an antimicrobial, antiparasitic in the treatment of coughs, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatism</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and other disease as folk treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalent constituents of this plant latex are <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35190">diterpenes</z:chebi> from the Inganen types (ingenol <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi>) as well as the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37526">tigliane</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol esters</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scientifically, there is not any data till now about anticancer effects of the Euphorbia tirucalli Linn., since the Ingenol <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> have already presented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-promoting ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microtubules (MTs), and cytoskeletal proteins are essential in eukaryotic cells for a variety of functions, such as cellular transport, cell motility and mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single Inganen in cytoplasm can interact with these proteins and affect on their crucial functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed the effects of Inganen on MT organization using ultraviolet spectrophotometer and fluorometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fluorescent spectroscopy showed a significant tubulin conformational change at the presence of Inganen which decrease polymerization of tubulin as well as the ultraviolet spectroscopy results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to find the potential function of Inganen for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in cells and human organs </plain></SENT>
