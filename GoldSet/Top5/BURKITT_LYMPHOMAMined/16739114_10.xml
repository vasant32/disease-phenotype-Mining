<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Jaw1, also known as lymphoid-restricted membrane protein (LRMP), is an endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High levels of Jaw1/LRMP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> have been found in germinal centre B-cells and in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of 'germinal centre' subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper documents Jaw1/LRMP expression at the protein level in human tissues by immunohistochemical and western blotting analysis using an antibody reactive with paraffin-embedded tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Jaw1/LRMP was highly expressed in germinal centre B-cells (in keeping with gene expression data), in 'monocytoid B-cells', and in splenic marginal zone B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was absent, or present at only low levels, in mature T-cells, although cortical thymocytes were weakly positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, Jaw1/LRMP was found in germinal centre-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (follicle centre <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, lymphocyte-predominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>) but not in T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (with the exception of a single T lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> lacked Jaw1/LRMP but many cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (but not mantle zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) were Jaw1/LRMP-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately half of the marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were Jaw1/LRMP-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, Jaw1/LRMP was found in three-quarters (24/32) of the cases classified phenotypically as being of 'germinal centre' type, but it was also expressed in almost half (13/28) of the 'non-germinal centre' cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A similar proportion of 'non-germinal centre' cases were positive for the protein products of two other genes expressed highly in germinal centre cells (HGAL/GCET2 and PAG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The fact that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three of these proteins are expressed in a significant proportion of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> assigned to the 'non-germinal centre' category indicates that the immunophenotypic categorization of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> according to cellular origin may be more complicated than currently understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, the expression of Jaw1/LRMP in other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in non-lymphoid tissues/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> may be of interest in differential diagnosis and research </plain></SENT>
