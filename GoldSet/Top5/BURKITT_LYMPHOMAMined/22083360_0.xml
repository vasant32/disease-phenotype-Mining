<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>B cells start their life with low affinity antibodies generated by V(D)J recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, upon detecting a pathogen, the variable (V) region of an immunoglobulin (Ig) gene is mutated approximately 100,000-fold more than the rest of the genome through somatic hypermutation (SHM), resulting in high affinity antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, class switch recombination (CSR) produces antibodies with different effector functions depending on the kind of immune response that is needed for a particular pathogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both CSR and SHM are initiated by activation-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase (AID), which deaminates <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> residues in DNA to produce <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracils</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracils</z:chebi> are processed by error-prone forms of repair pathways, eventually leading to mutations and recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our current understanding of the molecular details of SHM and CSR come from a combination of studies in mice, primary cells, cell lines, and cell-free experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mouse models remain the gold standard with genetic knockouts showing critical roles for many repair factors (e.g. Ung, Msh2, Msh6, Exo1, and polymerase Î·) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genes are amenable for knockout studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For example, knockouts of several double-strand break repair proteins are embryonically lethal or impair B-cell development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, sometimes the specific function of a protein in SHM or CSR may be masked by more global defects caused by the knockout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, since experiments in mice can be lengthy, altering expression of individual genes in cell lines has become an increasingly popular first step to identifying and characterizing candidate genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ramos - a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line that constitutively undergoes SHM - has been a popular cell-line model to study SHM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One advantage of Ramos cells is that they have a built-in convenient semi-quantitative measure of SHM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild type</z:mp> cells express IgM and, as they pick up mutations, some of the mutations knock out IgM expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, assaying IgM loss by fluorescence-activated cell scanning (FACS) provides a quick read-out for the level of SHM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A more quantitative measurement of SHM can be obtained by directly sequencing the antibody genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Since Ramos cells are difficult to transfect, we produce stable derivatives that have increased or lowered expression of an individual gene by infecting cells with retroviral or lentiviral constructs that contain either an overexpression cassette or a short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (shRNA), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe how we infect Ramos cells and then use these cells to investigate the role of specific genes on SHM (Figure 1) </plain></SENT>
