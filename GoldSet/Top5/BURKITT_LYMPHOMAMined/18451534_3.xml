<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The variation of gene expression in the treatment of both cells with SAL was analyzed using the differential display (DD) method with combination of 16 kinds of arbitary primers and 3 kinds of anchor primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment of Raji cells with SAL down-regulated mitochondria-associated granulocyte-macropharge colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling molecule (Magmas) gene, and up-regulated N-myc downstream regulated gene (NDRG) 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, treatment of Daudi cells with SAL down-regulated Rad50 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since Magmas gene expression was repressed in SAL-treated Raji cells, but did not change in SAL-treated D-threo-1-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-2-decanoylamino-3-morphorino-1-propanol (PDMP)-pretreated Raji cells, it was clear that the expression of Magmas, NDRG3 or Rad50 was regulated by SAL binding to Gb3 </plain></SENT>
