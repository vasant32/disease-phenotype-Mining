<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A nonrandom radial nuclear organization of genes has been well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study provides further evidence that radial positioning depends on features of corresponding ∼1 Mbp chromatin domains (CDs), which represent the basic units of higher-order chromatin organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a quantitative three-dimensional analysis of the radial nuclear organization of three genes located on chromosome 1 in a DG75 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed similar transcription levels for the three selected genes, whereas the total expression strength (<z:chebi fb="34" ids="39035">TES</z:chebi>) calculated as the sum of transcription of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genes annotated within a surrounding window of about 1 Mbp DNA differed for each region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radial nuclear position of the studied CDs correlated with <z:chebi fb="34" ids="39035">TES</z:chebi>, i.e., the domain with the highest <z:chebi fb="34" ids="39035">TES</z:chebi> occupied the most interior position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positions of CDs with stable <z:chebi fb="34" ids="39035">TES</z:chebi> values were stably maintained even under experimental conditions, resulting in genome-wide changes of the expression levels of many other genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results strongly support the hypothesis that knowledge of the local chromatin environment is essential to predict the radial nuclear position of a gene </plain></SENT>
