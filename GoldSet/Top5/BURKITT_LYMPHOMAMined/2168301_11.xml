<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the development of the T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was linked to EBV, we studied this patient's EBV-specific immune response and her T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue for evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood lymphocytes from this patient were systematically studied for immune function and response to EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> tissue was examined for EBV genome and for evidence of EBV replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This patient failed to develop anti-EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibodies and had decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her T-cells showed a broad suppression of both autologous and allogeneic B-cells, which was coincident with clinical hypoimmunoglobulinemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A selective cytotoxic T-cell defect toward autologous EBV-infected B lymphoblasts, which could not be corrected by the addition of lymphokine-mediated T-cell help, was also documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A lymph node biopsy taken 5 years after her clinical presentation revealed lymph node architecture completely effaced by a diffuse CD3+, CD4+, Ia+, CR2+ T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> containing EBNA and linear, replicating EBV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Select CEBVI patients with humoral and combined cellular aberrations in the immune response to EBV may be predisposed to the development of EBV+ T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
