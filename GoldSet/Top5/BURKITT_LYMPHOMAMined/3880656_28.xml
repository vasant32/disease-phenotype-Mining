<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients were ineligible; E-rosette-positive patients with greater than or equal to 25% blasts in the marrow entered after February 1977 were reported separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radiotherapy could be used to treat patients with compressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025061" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mediastinal disease</z:e> at diagnosis and was prescribed for those with residual abdominal disease as demonstrated by second-look surgery on completion of induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of diagnosis by the Pathology Panel and Repository Center for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Clinical Trials was mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic tissues of 131 patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 107 evaluable patients, 91 (85%) achieved complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences in response rates among the three major histologic groups (lymphoblastic, undifferentiated, and large cell) were of statistical significance, with response being poorest for diffuse undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Failure-free survival did not differ significantly for the three major histologic diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While response rate was lowest for Murphy Stage III patients (79%), the differences among the stages were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stage was not a significant prognostic factor for failure-free survival (P = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of patients still at risk and the Kaplan-Meier estimate of percentage of patients remaining at risk after 3 years is: Stage I, 8 (100%); Stage II, 10 (67%); Stage III, 28 (57%); Stage IV, 6 (39%); and greater than 25% blasts, 1 (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stage III failure curves for lymphoblastic disease show continuing stepwise failure through 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among patients with diffuse large cell and undifferentiated disease, most failures occurred by 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>M1 and M2 levels of marrow involvement were not prognostic among children with lymphoblastic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The presence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240318" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mediastinal mass</z:e> was a significant factor contributing to failure in children with lymphoblastic disease without marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Leucocytosis greater than 10,000/1, was a significant (P = less than 0.001) factor predicting failure-free survival for patients with large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The delivery of radiotherapy was not a significant factor in achieving remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>No consistent benefit resulted from using radiotherapy to treat postinduction <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> demonstrated on second-look exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The LSA2-L2 regimen was associated with considerable toxicity, severe or worse in 77% and life-threatening to 40% of these patients </plain></SENT>
