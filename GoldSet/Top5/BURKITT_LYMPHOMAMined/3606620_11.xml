<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This biophysical change was detected flow cytometrically by measuring the intensity of fluorescent emission from cells stained with dye indicators of membrane potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subclones of Daudi <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, resistant to growth inhibition by alpha interferon, showed no membrane depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parallel results were obtained in initial tests of an isologous pair of T cell and B cell lines which differ in sensitivity to growth inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, decreased membrane potential may herald an interferon signal for antiproliferative action </plain></SENT>
