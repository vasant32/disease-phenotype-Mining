<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the Raji IgG radioimmunoassay and 125I-Clq binding assay were used to detect IgG- and IgM-containing CIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients with other hyperkeratotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin disorders</z:e> were studied as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were studied before institution of systemic therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4913">etretinate</z:chebi> (20 patients) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis-retinoic acid</z:chebi> (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, sera of 15 of the patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4913">etretinate</z:chebi> were studied before, during, and after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extent of pretreatment disease involvement as well as response to therapy were evaluated in a blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 21 (67%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> had evidence of IgA-containing CIC at some time during the course of their disease, as compared to only 1 of 25 patients with other hyperkeratotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 2 of 19 (11%) had evidence of IgG-containing CIC using the Raji IgG assay, and only 1 of 19 (5%) had evidence of IgG- or IgM-containing CIC using the 125I-Clq binding assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was found between the extent of pretreatment disease involvement and the level of IgA-containing CIC by linear regression analysis (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was, however, no correlation between clinical improvement and the presence or level of IgA-containing CIC in 15 patients followed during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">Sucrose</z:chebi> density gradient analysis of the IgA-containing CIC found in 2 of these patients demonstrated IgA-containing CIC in the 9S to 13S region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The finding of IgA-containing CIC in a significant number of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> and the relative absence of IgG- or IgM-containing CIC suggest that IgA-containing CIC may play a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The lack of correlation with clinical improvement, however, suggests these IgA-containing CIC are not directly related to the cutaneous manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo>, but may be important in the modification of immune or <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> in these patients </plain></SENT>
