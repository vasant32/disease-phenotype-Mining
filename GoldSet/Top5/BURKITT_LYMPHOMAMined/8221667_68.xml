<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Gb3/CD77 is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> antigen, specifically expressed on two different B-cell populations, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a subset of tonsillar B-lymphocytes located in germinal centers, which could be the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterpart of Burkitt cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both Gb3/CD77(+) populations have recently been shown to enter programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>) readily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that verotoxin, also called Shiga-like toxin, which is known to bind to the carbohydrate moiety of Gb3/CD77, induces cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in Gb3/CD77(+) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, not only by inhibiting protein synthesis as classically described but also through an additional mechanism, namely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore a recombinant B-subunit of verotoxin, which carries only the binding property of the holotoxin, also induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Gb3/CD77(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gb3/CD77 could thus represent the first example of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> antigen able to transduce a signal leading to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
