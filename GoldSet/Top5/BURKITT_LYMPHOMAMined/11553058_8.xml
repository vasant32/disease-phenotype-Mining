<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To gain more insight into the immunophenotypic and cytogenetic changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> at relapse, 99 Korean patients treated at a single institution were studied: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, n=46), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL, n=44) and biphenotypic and mixed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypic changes at relapse were observed in 51 of 99 patients (51.5%) with almost even distribution in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall expression of aberrant markers on leukaemic cells was more frequent at relapse than at initial diagnosis (P &lt; 0.05), and this finding was most prominent in B lineage ALL (41.4% versus 10.3%, P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gain of aberrant CD13 or CD33 at relapse of B lineage ALL was most frequently observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic changes at relapse were observed in 28 of 46 patients (60.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The initially abnormal karyotypes were more frequently associated with clonal changes at relapse compared to initially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes (78.3% versus 43.5%, P=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic changes were more frequent in B lineage ALL than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (90% versus 47.8%, P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In ALL, patients showing cytogenetic changes at relapse were significantly younger than those showing no changes (mean age of 15.0 versus 38.8, P=0.002), whereas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> there was no significant difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the gain of aberrant markers and cytogenetic changes at relapse, which are suggestive of clonal instability, are more prevalent in B lineage ALL compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and lymphoid leukaemic cells of younger patients are more susceptible to clonal changes at relapse </plain></SENT>
