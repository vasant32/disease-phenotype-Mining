<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the levels of 6 different cytokines in the sera of 10 newly diagnosed patients with B cell lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) and detected a significant increase in IL-6 and IFN-alpha serum levels in comparison to that of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whole blood cell cultures of 10 ALL patients and 20 control individuals were induced with classical cytokine inducers, such as virus, PHA and LPS, and their ability to produce 9 different cytokines was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood cells of ALL patients produced significantly less IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-10 and TNF-alpha than control cells and not significanly lower levels of IL-6, but comparable with control levels of IL-2, IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rHuGM-CSF added to cell cultures 24 h before induction significantly enhanced the production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in controls, but only IL-1alpha and IL-1beta in the blood cell cultures of patients with ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF did not significantly influence the production of IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 in the control cells and the cells of ALL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients examined differed not only in the expression of CD10 and CD34 antigens on blast cells, but also in the reaction to GM-CSF treatment, which was found as very high standard deviation values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suppose that these differences can partially explain the different effects of GM-CSF when used to ameliorate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> of ALL patients after chemotherapy and to reduce the incidence of microbial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
