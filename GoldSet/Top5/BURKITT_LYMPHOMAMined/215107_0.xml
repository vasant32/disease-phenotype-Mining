<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) receptor activity in cell free extracts is operationally defined as one which causes a reduction in the effective concentration of the early antigen inducing particles of an EBV preparation when the latter is preincubated with the extract before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such activity was detected in the surface extract of Raji cells and to a lesser extent in that of BJAB cells, both of which are B lymphoblastoid cells that are susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Receptor activity was not detected in similar extracts of P3HR-1 cells and human diploid fibroblasts neither of which are known to be susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Receptor activity in the Raji cell extract was found to be associated with membranous structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This may have rendered the activity resistant to treatment with trypsin and sonication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The activity was however abrogated if the extract was exposed to neutral detergent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binding of receptor activity was observed when Raji cell extract was chromatographed on a column of immobilized EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent electrophoretic analysis showed however that this procedure did not result in an appreciable purification of the receptor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neutral detergent treated extract was similarly chromatographed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The resulting eluates did not contain detectable receptor activity but were less <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in protein content as compared with that of the original extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is not certain at present if these EBV binding proteins are involved in the receptor activity of the extract </plain></SENT>
