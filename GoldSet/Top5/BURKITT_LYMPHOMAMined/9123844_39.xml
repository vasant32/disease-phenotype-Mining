<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HHV-8 is related by nucleotide sequence homology to herpesvirus saimiri (HVS), which causes T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in some New World monkeys, and to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human herpesvirus linked etiologically with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report that, like HVS but unlike EBV, HHV-8 contains a gene (ORF74) with significant sequence homology to the high-affinity IL-8 receptor, a member of the alpha (CXC) chemokine receptor family of transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also show by reverse transcription PCR that the chemokine receptor-related HHV-8 gene is detectable in some <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> samples from KS tissue, and that its expression varies independently from that of ORF26, a minor capsid protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of a potential chemokine receptor in HHV-8 and its expression in KS tissue suggests that it may be important in the regulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene expression and may play a role in the etiology of KS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related body cavity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
