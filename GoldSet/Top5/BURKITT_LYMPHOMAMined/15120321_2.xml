<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The compounds were tested at 10 microM for their vitro antileukemic activity against K562 (Human <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>) and Raji (human Burkitt limphoma ) cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4305">Dacarbazine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> were used for comparative purpose </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4305">Dacarbazine</z:chebi> at 10 microM showed no activity in the above tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observed difference among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4305">Dacarbazine</z:chebi> and the active 4-triazenopyrazoles migth be explained admiting that these last compounds, differently by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4305">Dacarbazine</z:chebi>, did not follow a mechanism of action based on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P-450</z:chebi> induced demethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most active compound 2d showed growth inhibition values of 97.8 and 99.4% against K562 and Raji cell lines respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">Methotrexate</z:chebi> inhibition values at 0.2 microM against the above cell lines were 86.7 and 75.1% respectively </plain></SENT>
