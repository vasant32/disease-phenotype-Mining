<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show here that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> may induce a change in responsiveness to TGF beta, since TGF beta inhibits traverse of the cell cycle of activated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B cells, but promotes cell proliferation of EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines as well as EBV-infected B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present evidence that the switch in the responsiveness to TGF beta is mediated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, irrespective of the proliferative status of target cells, and thus may contribute to the initiation as well as the maintenance of certain B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
