<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The classification of B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) by specific chromosomal translocations may have prognostic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is a useful tool for the detection of fusion transcript resulting from specific chromosomal translocation of the leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general, fusion transcripts are determined individually, a process which is labor intensive in order to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major fusion transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: We use a multiplex RT-PCR assay to detect both the <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>- and ALL-type BCR-ABL transcripts of the t(9;22), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> described variants of the E2A-PBX1 transcripts of t(1;19), the MLL-AF4 transcripts of t(4;11), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> described variants of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 (also termed ETV6-CBFA2) of the cryptic t(12;21) in 165 leukemic samples at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study yielded a completely concordant result with those obtained by the individual RT-PCR assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this cohort of Taiwan children, the relative frequencies of the four translocations of B-lineage ALL were as following: 6% with ALL-type t(9;22)/BCR-ABL, 7% t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1, 3% t(4;11)/MLL-AF4, and 18% t(12;21)/<z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1, comparable to those in the Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Multiplex RT-PCR assay is an efficient, sensitive, accurate, and cost-effective diagnostic tool, which will likely improve our ability in accurately and rapidly risk-stratifying children with ALL </plain></SENT>
