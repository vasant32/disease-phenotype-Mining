<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased blasts were observed in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The blasts were characterized by large cells with abundant, intensely basophilic, vacuolated cytoplasm, round nuclei, and prominent nucleoli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis revealed a nonrandom t(8;22)(q24;q11) chromosomal abnormality, and surface-marker analysis disclosed a positive immunophenotype for CD10, CD19, CD20, CD38, HLA-DR, FMC7, and IgM-lambda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings yielded a diagnosis of L3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A specimen of perforated tissue revealed a diffuse infiltration of leukemic cells through the small bowel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, bone marrow specimens showed no signs of aggravation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
