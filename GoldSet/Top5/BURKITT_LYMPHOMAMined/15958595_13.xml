<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We had previously showed that transduction of murine p53-null bone marrow cells with a Myc-encoding retrovirus is sufficient for B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address the role of Myc in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sustenance, we generated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> induced by the Myc-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor fusion protein (MycER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Engrafted hosts were continuously treated with the ER ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) to allow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent inactivation of MycER via 4-OHT deprivation resulted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stasis but only partial regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the cellular level, dormant neoplastic lymphocytes withdrew from mitosis and underwent further B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, they up-regulated genes involved in lymphocyte proliferation and survival, most notably interleukin 10 receptor alpha (IL10Ralpha) and CD20, the target for antibody therapy with Rituxan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that overexpression of IL10Ralpha affords significant proliferative advantages and in 4-OHT-deprived animals correlates with eventual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both dormant and relapsing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> maintain IL10Ralpha expression suggesting that they might be sensitive to emerging drugs targeting the IL-10 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of CD20 following Myc inactivation was also observed in immortalized human lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Importantly, in this system, Myc(OFF)CD20(HIGH) cells were more prone to Rituxan-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> than Myc(ON)CD20(MED) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, targeting Myc, while moderately effective on its own, shapes the phenotype of dormant neoplastic cells and sensitizes them to adjuvant molecular therapies </plain></SENT>
