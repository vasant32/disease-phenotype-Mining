<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The CD45 antigen cluster identifies a family of transmembrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) present on nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hemopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that CD45 may play a role in the control of receptor mediated blood cell responses, and that expression of the CD45 gene varies during bone marrow cell maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, relatively little is known of the mechanisms controlling CD45 expression and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the induction of granulocyte or monocyte differentiation of HL60 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells is accompanied by a rapid increase in CD45 antigen expression and CD45 PTPase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines induced for monocyte/macrophage differentiation did not show increased CD45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation of radiolabelled CD45 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulphoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO) treated HL60 cells indicated that the cells expressed 200 and 180 kD isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Northern blots of steady-state <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from HL60 cells showed a 4-11-fold increase in CD45 transcripts after DMSO treatment, but no alteration in the half-life of CD45 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nuclear transcription assays showed that CD45 expression was controlled at the level of gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Namalwa Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells expressing the heterologous epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor protein tyrosine kinase were used to assess the specificity of CD45 PTPase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Co-clustering of CD45 and the EGF receptor with specific monoclonal antibodies failed to alter the EGF stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that CD45 increases during myeloid maturation, and the expression of the CD45 gene is controlled at the level of gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preliminary studies suggest that CD45 does not alter the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor in intact cells, suggesting substrate specificity in vivo </plain></SENT>
