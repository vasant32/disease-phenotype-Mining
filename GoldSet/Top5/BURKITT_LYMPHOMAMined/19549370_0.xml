<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> were used to treat Raji cells and its effects of time and dose were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was observed under light microscope; flow cytometry was used to analyze cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>; RT-PCR was used to detect the expressions of NF-kappaB and p53 gene <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> could inhibit Raji cell growth within a certain range of treating time and dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> were induced in relation to time and dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of NF-kappaB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> decreased after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> can induce Raji cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which provides a theoretical basis for clinical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NF-kappaB and p53 gene are supposed to participate in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Raji cells </plain></SENT>
