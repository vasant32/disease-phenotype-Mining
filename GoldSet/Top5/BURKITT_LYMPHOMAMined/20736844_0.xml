<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 48 patients (37 boys, 77%) with a median age of 8 years (range 2 to 16 years) at diagnosis, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Primary tumor</z:e> sites were abdomen (70.8%), head and neck (22.9%), peripheral lymph node (2%), bone (2%), and testis (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 78.1±4% and 76.6±6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level less than 10 g/dL, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) positivity and dialysis requirement at diagnosis were found to be important reverse predictor factors for EFS (P; 0.001, 0.001, 0.004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level less than 10 g/dL and dialysis at diagnosis were found to be important reverse predictor factors for EFS (P; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EFS of our patients was lower than the values achieved with BFM-95 protocol in other centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study provides evidence that low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, CSF positivity and dialysis at diagnosis were important predictor factors for EFS in children with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
