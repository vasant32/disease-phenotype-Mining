<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the ovary are rare, and their clinicopathologic features are incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> initially diagnosed in the ovary in 16 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed immunohistochemistry for CD20, CD3, CD10, BCL6, IRF4/MUM1, and BCL2 and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization for translocations involving BCL2, BCL6, and IRF4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clustering was performed on the basis of clinicopathologic and genetic variables using Cluster 3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ages ranged from 42 to 73 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed 2 distinct groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One group (group A) included 7 cases, which were negative or weakly positive for BCL2 protein and lacked IGH@/BCL2 translocations (6 cases evaluable) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients were of grade 3A, and 3 patients were of grade 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four had stage IE disease with unilateral ovarian involvement (subgroup A(1)), and the stage was unknown in 3 patients (subgroup A(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The second group (group B) included 9 cases of low histologic grade, which strongly expressed BCL2 protein and had IGH@/BCL2 translocations (7 cases evaluable) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients had stage III/IV disease, 2 had stage II disease, and the stage was unknown in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although follow-up intervals were limited, patients with higher-grade/low-stage disease tended to have favorable outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data indicate 2 distinct types of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> presenting in the ovary: a low-grade/high-stage/BCL2-positive group and a higher-grade/low-stage/BCL2-negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This latter group likely has distinct biological and immunologic characteristics, as has been suggested for higher-grade/low-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> presenting at other extranodal sites </plain></SENT>
