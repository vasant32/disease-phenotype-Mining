<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These results were correlated with the French-American-British morphological classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> non-lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> was diagnosed in 55 individuals on the basis of <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cytochemical criteria; 6 of this group were further studied with antibodies directed against specific myelomonocytic antigens, but no further clinically useful information was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blasts from 36 patients did not stain with either Sudan black or myeloperoxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These individuals were considered to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) and were further assessed with monoclonal antibodies directed against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> expressed on cells of lymphoid lineage; 10 were classified as arising from T precursors; 23 were of B lineage, of which 13 marked as common, 6 as null, 1 as pre-B, 2 as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> and 1 to have a pattern characteristic of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two cases could not be classified and 1 was found to have megakaryoblastic features </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the value of monoclonal antibodies for accurately assigning lineage to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> and particularly in those situations where conventional morphological criteria and cytochemical markers are inconclusive </plain></SENT>
