<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate how overexpression of MAD, an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of MYC oncogenes influences the malignant phenotype of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, an adenovirus vector system was used to transfer the human MAD gene (AdMAD) into human <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Decreased growth potential of AdMAD-infected cells was evidenced by a decrease in [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation, an increase in cell doubling time and alteration of cell-cycle distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diminished malignant potential of AdMAD-infected cells was manifested by their loss of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and by their inability, in general, to induce <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in a xenograft animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that adenovirus constructs encoding MAD dramatically inhibit the proliferation and tumorigenicity of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo> cells and support the use of MAD for gene therapy of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
