<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism of this potentiation, the biological markers related to DNA damage and cell survival were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: IFN-alpha-sensitive Daudi and its resistant cells were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival after treatment was assessed by clonogenic assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA breaks were studied by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Production of reactive oxygen metabolites was measured using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">Messenger RNA</z:chebi> and protein were examined by RT-PCR and immunoblot, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IFN-alpha treatment for 24 h before irradiation potentiated the sensitivity of Daudi cells to X-rays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This combination induced 50 kb DNA fragmentation and activated caspase-3 in Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with IFN-alpha inhibited the production of reactive oxygen species by irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IFN-alpha pretreatment down-regulated most of the double-strand break (DSB) repair-related <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>, but did not affect the repair of DSBs studied by PFGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The induction and phosphorylation of p21(Cip1/WAF1) (p21) was prominently suppressed in cells pretreated with IFN-a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with IFN-alpha potentiates the cytotoxic effects of X-rays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of X-ray-induced p21 may cause the augmented sensitivity by IFN-alpha pretreatment </plain></SENT>
