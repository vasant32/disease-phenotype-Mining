<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two Epstein-Barr virus latent cycle promoters for nuclear antigen expression, Wp and Cp, are activated sequentially during virus-induced transformation of B cells to B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously published restriction enzyme studies have indicated hypomethylation of CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> in the Wp and Cp regions of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome in established LCLs, whereas these same regions appeared to be hypermethylated in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, where Wp and Cp are inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, using the more sensitive technique of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> genomic sequencing, we reexamined the situation in established LCLs with the typical pattern of dominant Cp usage; surprisingly, this showed substantial methylation in the 400-bp regulatory region upstream of the Wp start site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was not an artifact of long-term in vitro passage, since, in cultures of recently infected B cells, we found progressive methylation of Wp (but not Cp) regulatory sequences occurring between 7 and 21 days postinfection, coincident with the period in which dominant nuclear antigen promoter usage switches from Wp to Cp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the equivalent in vivo situation, i.e., in the circulating B cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> patients undergoing primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, we again frequently observed selective methylation of Wp but not Cp sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An effector role for methylation in Wp silencing was supported by methylation cassette assays of Wp reporter constructs and by bandshift assays, where the binding of two sets of transcription factors important for Wp activation in B cells, BSAP/Pax5 and CREB/ATF proteins, was shown to be blocked by methylation of their binding sites </plain></SENT>
