<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the use of intervent dilution chromatography followed by sequential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi>-cellulose and phosphocellulose column chromatography, the virus-associated enzyme has been isolated and purified 300-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The partially purified EBV DNA polymerase activity could be distinguished from cellular polymerases by its activation with salt and its degree of sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44485">N-ethylmaleimide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15732">phosphonoacetic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
