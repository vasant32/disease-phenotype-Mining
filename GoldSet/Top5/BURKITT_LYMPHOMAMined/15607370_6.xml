<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the search for new therapeutic targets, reliable and well-characterised in vitro models are essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have characterised three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cell lines (SP53, Granta 519 and NCEB1) in comparison with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL), a FL cell line (RL), a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (RAJI) and five different B cell populations from healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression profiling was used to determine the relative expression of &gt;12000 transcripts in these samples, and flow cytometry analysis was performed to establish a phenotypic signature for each of the cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the cell lines were sequenced, and the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> and immunoglobulin (Ig) variable heavy chain (VH) usage were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show by hierarchical clustering that the cell lines retain a genetic signature similar to primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, which readily separated the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> samples from the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and the FL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cell lines showed differences in the frequency of VH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> (0-2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increased number of mutations in NCEB1, compared to the other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cell lines, was in agreement with a decreased expression of CD31, CD44, CXCR5, CCR7 and CCR6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data show that the cell lines are clearly derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and expressed similar genetic and phenotypic signatures compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e>, which confirmed their usefulness as in vitro models </plain></SENT>
