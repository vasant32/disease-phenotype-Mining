<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells are of B- or T-cell type is an important criterion for prognosis which has not been available previously to pathologists, due to the lack of a reliable early B-cell marker functioning on routinely processed material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This has changed with the production of monoclonal antibodies against the B-cell signalling molecule CD79a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD79a is expressed on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic B cells from the early stages of B-cell maturation and has been considered to be B-cell-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Currently available antibodies against CD79a, in particular JCB117, allow the identification of B cells, and hence B lymphoblastic disease, in paraffin-embedded material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, the expression of CD79a (JCB117) and CD3 has been investigated in 149 cases of T and 68 cases of B lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the first time, co-expression of CD79a (JCB117) and CD3 is reported in 10 per cent of cases of T lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding raises questions about the co-expression of T- and B-cell markers in the development of lymphocytes, benign as well as malignant, and alerts pathologists to a potential problem in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
