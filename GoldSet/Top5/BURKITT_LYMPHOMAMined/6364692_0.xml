<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the prognostic information of the Kiel classification a homogeneous material of 63 non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of unfavourable Rappaport histology were re-evaluated according to the definitions of the Kiel classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were selected from a prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> study including 775 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only ambiguous histological diagnoses analysed independently by two hematopathologists were accepted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunological markers of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> studied both in suspensions and on cryostate sections were in addition analysed in 40 of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-one per cent (26/63) were of high grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> according to the Kiel classification, 59% (36/63) were of low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DLPD group was most <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> while a better concordance was found between DM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1511945" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CB/CC</z:e> and between DH and CB cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, prognostic subgroups of the two classifications were only partly equivalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A good correlation was found between the Kiel high-grade malignant group and patients of Rappaport poorest prognosis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e>, DH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight per cent of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were of B cell, 5% of T cell and 7% of non-B-non-T phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both the Kiel and Rappaport morphologic classifications predicted survival in this selected material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with B phenotypes survived longer than patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of non-B type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, those with a nodular and irregular distribution of immunoglobulin and C3d receptors tended to respond better and survived longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No prognostic information was obtained from immunoglobulin isotypes, C3d or Fc-gamma receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the Kiel classification is equally reliable for clinical judgement as the Rappaport system and that immunological marker studies may add prognostic information </plain></SENT>
