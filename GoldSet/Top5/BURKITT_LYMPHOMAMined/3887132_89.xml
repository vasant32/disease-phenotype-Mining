<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an effort to study in detail the nature of the protein product of the human protooncogene c-myc, we have expressed the gene at high levels in Escherichia coli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The c-myc coding region was taken from a full-length cDNA clone and inserted into a vector designed to express foreign gene products efficiently in E. coli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulse-labeling experiments indicated that the rate of expression of c-myc in this thermoinducible expression system is very efficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The product was relatively stable and accumulated to approximately 10% of total cellular protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A purification protocol was devised which allowed the c-myc protein to be readily purified in quantities sufficient for detailed biochemical and physical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A high-titer polyclonal antiserum was raised against the pure protein and shown to immunoprecipitate the p110gag-myc fusion protein of MC-29-infected quail cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This antiserum also selectively detects a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 64,000 by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis analysis from a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this 64-kilodalton protein is the human c-myc gene product since the E. coli-made protein exhibits an equivalent molecular weight on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, even though its calculated molecular weight is 49,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bacterially made human c-myc protein is a DNA-binding protein and that it exhibits a high nonspecific affinity for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
