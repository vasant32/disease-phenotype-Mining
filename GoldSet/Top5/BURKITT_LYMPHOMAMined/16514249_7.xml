<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have reviewed data on 14 patients with breast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> seen at our institution from 1990 to 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were female, with a median age of 47.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) was observed in 9 cases, while follicular, Burkitt's, small lymphocytic, MALT and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were observed in 1 case each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5 patients (35.7%) had stage IE disease, 6 patients (42.9%) had stage IIE disease and 3 patients (21.4%) had stage IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standard CHOP with or without rituximab was given to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with aggressive breast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 10), while 1 patient with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> received a CHOP-based regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3-year actuarial survival estimate among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 patients with aggressive breast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e>, the estimated 3-year survival was 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The actuarial 3-year overall survival (OS) estimate for the entire cohort of 14 patients was 76.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that breast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is not associated with an inferior outcome when treated with standard CHOP-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
