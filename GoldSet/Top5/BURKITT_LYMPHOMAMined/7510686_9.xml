<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The alpha 4 integrin subunit can associate with either the beta 1- or beta 7-integrin subunit to form two unique <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> receptors alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 4 beta 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb 19H8) that immunoprecipitated alpha 4 beta 1, induced homotypic leukocyte aggregation, and blocked the binding of cells to a synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> corresponding to the CS-1 peptide region of fibronectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aggregation cross-blocking analysis suggested that mAb 19H8 belonged to the group of mAbs that react with the B2 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of the alpha 4 subunit (alpha 4.B2 epitope); however, unlike the alpha 4.B2-specific mAb L25, mAb 19H8 did not immunoprecipitate alpha 4 beta 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, mAb 19H8 did not bind to beta 1-positive cells unless transfected with alpha 4 cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that mAb 19H8 was not specific for an individual alpha 4, beta 1, or beta 7 subunit but reacted with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> formed from the association of alpha 4 with beta 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Separating the alpha 4 from the beta 1 subunit, by removing divalent cations or by treatment with high pH, disrupted mAb 19H8 binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the alpha 4-specific mAb L25 and the beta 1-specific mAb 18D3 could react with their respective subunits without subunit association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mAb 19H8 defined a novel regulatory <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> expressed by the integrin alpha 4 beta 1 </plain></SENT>
