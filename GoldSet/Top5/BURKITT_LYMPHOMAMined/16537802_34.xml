<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that, in patients with B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), cells with this phenotype detected early in treatment should be leukemic rather than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore developed a simple and inexpensive flow cytometric assay for such cells and prospectively applied it to bone marrow samples collected on day 19 from 380 children with B-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 211 patients (55.5%), these cells represented 0.01% or more of the mononuclear cells; results correlated remarkably well with those of more complex flow cytometric and molecular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 84 uniformly treated children, the 10-year incidence of relapse or remission failure was 28.8% +/- 7.1% (SE) for the 42 patients with 0.01% or more leukemic cells on day 19 detected by the simplified assay versus 4.8% +/- 3.3% for the 42 patients with lower levels (P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These assay results were the strongest predictor of outcome, even after adjustment for competing clinicobiologic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, this new assay would enable most treatment centers to identify a high proportion of children with ALL who have an excellent early treatment response and a high likelihood of cure </plain></SENT>
