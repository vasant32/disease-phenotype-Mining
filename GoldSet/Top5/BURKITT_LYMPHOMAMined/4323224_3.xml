<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This abnormality is in the form of a marked excess of E16 chromosomes per cell, either absolute or in relationship to other chromosome classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If the ratio of E16 chromosomes to those of other classes be the crucial parameter, several ratios involving E16 chromosomes must be considered as candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We feel the choice between such possible ratios might be better made when 100 or more human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> have been studied, rather than now </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It may be that imbalance in E16 chromosomes relative to certain other classes represents a necessary condition for malignant cell behavior, but that more than one such E16 imbalance may be a sufficient condition </plain></SENT>
