<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> mixed lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (AMLL) having combined Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) positivity and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The phenotypes of leukemic blasts from both cases were almost same (early B-lymphoid lineage and myeloid lineage); CD10+, CD13+, CD19+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR+, and dual-color analysis showed simultaneous expression of CD10 (CD19) and CD13 antigens in individual blasts (biphenotypic) in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On molecular analysis, the leukemic blasts showed rearrangement in the first intron of the BCR gene with breakpoint just outside of 3' end of m-BCR-2 (bcr 3) in case 1, and in the M-BCR in case 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) rearrangement was noted in both cases, but rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta-chain gene (TCR beta) was detected only in case 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinically, both cases achieved complete remission by the combination chemotherapy consisting of L-asparaginase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (L-AdVP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In remission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these molecular abnormalities disappeared in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the Ph1-positive and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 AMLL in adults is de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> with both early B-lymphoid and myeloid phenotypes and may arise from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of pluripotent stem cell, and expresses a heterogenous rearrangement pattern of the BCR gene </plain></SENT>
