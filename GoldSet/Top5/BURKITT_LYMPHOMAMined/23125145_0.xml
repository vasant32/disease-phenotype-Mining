<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed genomewide gene expression analysis of 35 samples representing 6 common histologic subtypes of canine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and bioinformatics analyses to define their molecular characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three major groups were defined on the basis of gene expression profiles: (1) low-grade T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, composed entirely by T-zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; (2) high-grade T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, consisting of lymphoblastic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> not otherwise specified; and (3) B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, consisting of marginal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interspecies comparative analyses of gene expression profiles also showed that marginal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in dogs and humans might represent a continuum of disease with similar drivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The classification of these diverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> into 3 subgroups was prognostically significant, as the groups were directly correlated with event-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, we developed a benchtop diagnostic test based on expression of 4 genes that can robustly classify canine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> into one of these 3 subgroups, enabling a direct clinical application for our results </plain></SENT>
