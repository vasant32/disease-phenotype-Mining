<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spectrum of etiotropic medicines against EBV is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The paper presents the anti-virus research of modified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> with a wide spectrum of action - 6-azacytidine and its derivatives (2'-3'-seco-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-6-AC, 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-6-AC and 2'-deoxy-6-AC) on the model of Epstein-Barr virus in Raji lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parameters of cytotoxicity (CC,) for the investigated substances were determined which amounted to 120 microg/ml, 180 microg/ml, 500 microg/ml, 330 microg/ml, and the effective concentration (ECU)--0.5 microg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1 microg/ml, 4 microg/ml, 11 microg/ml, in accordance with the sequence of preparations listed above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate a high antiEBV activity since their selectivity indexes (SI) were 240, 180, 125, 30 that is 1.3-10 times higher than the reference substance acycloguanosine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath>-stimulating action of 6-azacytidine and its derivatives was revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increase of percentage of apoptotic cells in EBV-infected Raji cells and those treated with investigated substances as compared to uninfected ones was observed after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results provide new biological properties of the azacytidine substances </plain></SENT>
