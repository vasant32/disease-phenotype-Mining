<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas there is compelling evidence for the effects of galectin-9 on T-cell fate, limited information is available on the impact of galectin-9 on B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that protease-resistant galectin-9, hG9NC(null), but not galectin-1 or -8, prevented cell growth of malignant B cells, such as Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24163">galactoside</z:chebi> binding was essential for galectin-9-induced cell growth suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>hG9NC(null) induced cell cycle arrest by reducing the expression of cyclin D1, D2, B1, Cdk4, Cdc25C and c-Myc, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by reducing the expression of XIAP, c-IAP2 and survivin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the genes that encode these proteins are regulated by nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and constitutive activation of NF-kappaBeta is a common characteristic of both types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>hG9NC(null) inhibited IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, resulting in suppression of NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AP-1 has also been implicated in the control of cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>hG9NC(null) inhibited the expression of JunD, resulting in the suppression of AP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that hG9NC(null) is a potentially suitable agent for the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
