<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified a significantly lower cellular accumulation of MTXPGs in T-lineage versus B-lineage lymphoblasts in children with ALL, which is consistent with the worse prognosis of T-lineage ALL when treated with conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolite</z:chebi>-based therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maximum MTXPG accumulation in leukemic blasts in vivo was 3-fold greater in lymphoblasts of children with B-lineage ALL (129 children) compared with those with T-lineage ALL (20 children) (p &lt; 0.01) and was characterized by a saturable (Emax) model in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines NALM6 (B-lineage) and CCRF/CEM (T-lineage) were used to assess potential mechanisms for these lineage differences in MTX accumulation, revealing i) greater total and long-chain MTXPG accumulation in NALM6 over a wide range of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> concentrations (0.2-100 microM), ii) saturation of MTXPG accumulation in both cell lines, with a higher maximum (Emax in NALM6, iii) 3-fold higher constitutive FPGS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and enzyme activity in NALM6 cells, iv) 2-fold lower levels of DHFR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in NALM6 cells, and v) 4-6 fold lower extracellular MTX concentration and 2-fold lower intracellular MTXPG concentration to produce equivalent cytotoxicity (LC50) in NALM6 versus CEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant relationship between FPGS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and enzyme activity in lymphoblasts from children with newly diagnosed ALL, and blast FPGS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and activity increased after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate higher FPGS and lower DHFR levels as potential mechanisms contributing to greater MTXPG accumulation and cytotoxicity in B-lineage lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
