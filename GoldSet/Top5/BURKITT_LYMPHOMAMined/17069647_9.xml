<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this five years study, only cases suggested or confirmed as NHL by FNAC were selected and FCI was performed with a complete panel of antibodies (CD3, CD2, CD 4, CD5, CD8, CD7, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD45, kappa and lambda) by dual color flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both cytologic findings and FCI data were interpreted together to diagnose and sub-classify NHL according to WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wherever possible the diagnoses were compared with cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were total 48 cases included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cases were classified on FNAC as predominant small cells (12), mixed small and large cells (5) and large cells (26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In five cases a suggestion of NHL was offered on FNAC material and these cases were labeled as NHL not otherwise specified (NHL-NOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry could be performed in 45 cases (93.8%) and in rest of the three cases the material was inadequate because of scanty blood mixed aspirate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Light chain restriction was demonstrated in 30 cases out of 40 cases of B-NHL (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 15 cases each of kappa and lambda light chain restriction in these 30 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With the help of combined FCI and FNAC, it was possible to sub-classify 38 cases of NHL (79%) according to WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Combined FNAC and FCI data helped to diagnose 9 cases of small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>), 2 cases of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), 4 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), 17 cases of diffuse large B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLBL) and 6 cases of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Histopathology diagnosis was available in 31 cases of NHL out of which there were 14 recurrent and 17 cases of primary NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Out of 15 DLBL cases diagnosed on FCI and FNAC, histology confirmed 14 cases and one of these cases was diagnosed as Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> on histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cases of FL (4), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e> (3) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (2) were well correlated with histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Out of the five cases suggestive of NHL on cytology, histopathology was available in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Histology diagnosis was given as DLBL (1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e> (1), anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1) and FL transformed into large cell NHL (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Considering histopathology as gold standard, diagnostic specificity of combined FNAC and FCI was 100% (31/31) and sensitivity in sub-classification was 83.8% (26/31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FNAC combined with FCI may be helpful in accurately sub-classifying NHL according to WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Many of the subtypes of NHL such as FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> which were previously recognized as a pure morphologic entity can be diagnosed by combined use of FNAC and FCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Other ancillary investigations such as chromosomal changes, cell proliferation markers etc. may be helpful in this aspect </plain></SENT>
