<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eight different CD40 mAb shared with soluble trimeric CD40 ligand (sCD40LT) the capacity to rescue germinal center (GC) B cells from spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and to suppress antigen receptor-driven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in group I Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three mAb (G28-5, M2 and M3) mimicked sCD40LT in its ability to promote strong homotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> in resting B cells, whereas others (EA5, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-OGY/C4 and 5C3) failed to stimulate strong clustering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Binding studies revealed that only those mAb that promoted strong B cell clustering bound at, or near to, the CD40L binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight mAb and sCD40LT were capable of synergizing with IL-4 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> for promoting DNA synthesis in resting B cells, co-stimulus-independent activation of the cells into cycle through CD40 related directly to the extent of receptor cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, mAb which bound outside the CD40L binding site synergized with sCD40LT for promoting DNA synthesis; maximal levels of stimulation were achieved by presenting any of the mAb on CD32 transfectants in the absence of sCD40LT or by cross-linking bound sCD40LT with a second antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monomeric sCD40L, which was able to promote rescue of GC B cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, was unable to drive resting B cells into cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that CD40-dependent rescue of human B cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> requires minimal cross-linking and is essentially <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> independent, whereas the requirements for promoting cell cycle progression and homotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> are more stringent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Possible mechanisms underlying these differences and their physiological significance are discussed </plain></SENT>
