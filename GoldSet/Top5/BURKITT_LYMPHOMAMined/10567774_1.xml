<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Olomoucine, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> derivative, inhibits multiple cyclin-dependent kinases that play important roles in regulating the G1/S and G2/M transitions of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the cellular effects of olomoucine in two human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, WMN (containing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53) and CA46 (containing mutant p53), and found that in consistency with its ability to block the activity of cyclin E/Cdk2 and cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinases, olomoucine caused cell cycle arrest at both G1/S and G2/S boundaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cell cycle arrest occurred equally well in these two cell lines bearing different p53 gene status, suggesting that p53 was not responsible for the cell cycle arrest by olomoucine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A similar p53-independent fashion was also observed in the cytotoxic potency and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction of olomoucine, in contrast to ionizing radiation which caused more cytotoxic activity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the WMN cell line bearing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 compared with CA46 cells bearing mutant p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such p53-independent cytotoxicity of olomoucine was also confirmed in other human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphoid cell lines containing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our results give an impetus to continued research into olomoucine that might be a very useful chemotherapeutic strategy in the treatment of patients with mutant p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, at least in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
