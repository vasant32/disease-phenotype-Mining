<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We experienced a case of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showing an unusual surface phenotype, CD5 expression, at an early stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially, this patient showed massive abdominal para-aortic lymph node swelling which rapidly developed into leukemic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the clinical course and cytogenetic features of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow, which showed t(8;14) and c-myc gene rearrangement, the patient was diagnosed with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combination chemotherapy induced short-term remission, but central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement developed, followed by a regrowth of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow at the end stage showed monotonous expansion of large cells with conspicuous vacuolation in the basophilic cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells showed pan-B markers and were CD5 positive but weakly CD10 positive; however, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells obtained from the bone marrow at the terminal stage did not express CD5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal t(8;14) was seen, and identical rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain joining gene and c-myc gene were detected by Southern blot analysis in the bone marrow lymphoblasts throughout the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case is evidence that remarkable transformation of CD5-positive lymphoblasts to CD5-negative lymphoblasts occurred in an identical clone of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
