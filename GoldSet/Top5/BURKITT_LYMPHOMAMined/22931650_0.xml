<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines were cultured in vitro with different concentrations of chidamide for different time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cell proliferation was determined by CCK-8 method; the cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential were analyzed by flow cytometry; the protein levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3/H4 acetylation in cells and the activity of caspase-3 were detected by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that chidamide inhibited the proliferation of 3 B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines in time- and concentration-dependent manners, especially in Z-138 cell line earlier and faster; chidamide could induce cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and decline of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential, which was more sensitive in Maver and Z-138 cells than that in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chidamide could elevate the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3/H4 acetylation level in 3 B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and the activity of caspase-3 in Maver and Z-138 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that chidamide can inhibit proliferation of B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and promote cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, the increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3/H4 acetylation induced by chidamide, triggering of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> pathway and activation of caspase-3 may be considered as possible mechanisms </plain></SENT>
