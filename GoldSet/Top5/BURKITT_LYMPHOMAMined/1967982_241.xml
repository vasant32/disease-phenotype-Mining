<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The gene (E2A) for enhancer binding transcription factors E12 and E47 maps to the t(1;19) chromosomal translocation breakpoint in pre-B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Altered E2A transcripts lacking sequences coding for the helix-loop-helix DNA binding motif were detected in several t(1;19)-carrying cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fusion cDNAs that crossed the t(1;19) breakpoint were cloned and shown to code for an 85 kd protein consisting of the amino-terminal two-thirds of E2A fused to a chromosome 1-derived protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fusion protein has the features of a chimeric transcription factor in which the DNA binding domain of E2A is replaced by the putative DNA binding domain of a homeoprotein from chromosome 1 for which the name Prl (pre-B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identical E2A-prl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> junctions were detected by PCR in three t(1;19)-carrying cell lines, indicating that the fusion transcripts and predicted chimeric protein are a consistent feature of this translocation </plain></SENT>
