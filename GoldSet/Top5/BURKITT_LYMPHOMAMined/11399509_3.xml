<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The chemokine, stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1 alpha) and its receptor CXCR-4 (fusin, LESTR) are thought to be involved in the trafficking of hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells, as suggested by the chemotactic effect of SDF-1 alpha on these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gene inactivation studies have shown that both SDF-1 alpha and CXCR-4 are essential for B lymphopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Migration of leukemic cells may also be dependent on SDF-1 alpha and CXCR-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibronectin (FN) is a component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and one of the natural supports for cell movement in their bone hematopoietic environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the influence of FN on the chemotactic effect of SDF-1 alpha and on the CXCR-4 expression and function on human precursor-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e>) cells at sequential stages of development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their immunophenotypes belonged to the first three stages of B cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite relatively high levels of CXCR-4 expression at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages, the responsiveness to SDF-1 alpha, measured as the percentage of migrating cells in the transwell culture system, varied with patients and seems to be less significant for pre-B3 (and pre-B1) than for pre-B2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation (r = 0.2) between the SDF-1 alpha induced migration (range: 2.5-39%) and the cell surface density of CXCR-4 (range: 46.5-97.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The extracellular matrix protein FN, either coated on the filter (for more than 18 hours) or in soluble form, enhanced the SDF-1 alpha induced migration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> respectively (2 fold and 1.6 fold) without influencing CXCR-4 expression in short term cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we analyzed the expression of the FN receptors, VLA-4 (CD49d) and VLA-5 (CD49e), by direct immunofluorescence, on these leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>VLA-4 was strongly expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> (range: 77-97%) while VLA-5 expression was more variable (range: 14-94%), but no correlation with the FN-dependent increased SDF-1 alpha chemotactic effect was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the migratory behavior of pre-B leukemic cells in response to SDF-1 alpha partly depends upon the stage of differentiation, and partly upon unexplained patient variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that several molecules from the extracellular matrix, such as FN, may be implicated in this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
