<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial treatment with OPAL (Oncovin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, adriamycin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>), and L-asparaginase (colaspase)) followed by craniospinal or cranial irradiation and intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> produced remission in 36 patients (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of these patients relapsed three to 18 months after the start of remission; the remainder had been in remission for 12 to 52 months by the end of the study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The predicted median survival was 27 months in those who achieved complete remission, one month in those who did not, and 21 months overall </plain></SENT>
