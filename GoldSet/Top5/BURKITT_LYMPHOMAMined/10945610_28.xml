<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the expression levels of the Ikaros gene family, Ikaros and Aiolos, in human bone marrow samples from patients with adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> [ALL (n = 46; B-cell ALL = 41; T-cell ALL = 5)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of the dominant negative isoform of Ikaros gene Ik-6 was observed in 14 of 41 B-cell ALL patients by reverse transcription-PCR, and the results were confirmed by sequencing analysis and immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the other dominant negative isoforms of the Ikaros gene were detected by reverse transcription-PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Southern blotting analysis with PstI digestion revealed that those patients with the dominant negative isoform Ik-6 might have small mutations in the Ikaros locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We did not detect any overexpression of dominant negative isoforms of Aiolos in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALL</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Ikaros plays a key role in human B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> through the dominant negative isoform Ik-6 </plain></SENT>
