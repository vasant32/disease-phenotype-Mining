<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The secondary structures were probed with nucleases and by chemical modification with single-strand-specific reagents, and the sites of modification or cleavage were mapped by primer extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data were used to develop secondary structures for the two <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, and likely sites of close <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-protein contact were identified by comparing modification patterns for naked <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in RNP particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, sites of interaction between each Epstein-Barr virus-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (EBER) and the La antigen were identified by analyzing <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> fragments resistant to digestion by RNase A or T1 after immunoprecipitation by an anti-La serum sample from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm earlier findings that the La protein binds to the 3' terminus of each molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Possible functions for the EBER RNPs are discussed </plain></SENT>
