<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) gene amplification to detect immunoglobulin gene rearrangements involving VH251, a heavy chain variable region preferentially utilized in B <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using synthetic amplimers derived from VH251 and the heavy chain joining region, under conditions of high stringency, a homogeneous VH251-specific fragment of approximately 350 bp could be amplified from leukaemic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 53 cases of B lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> screened for VH251 rearrangement by PCR, 10 were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A background level of VH251 rearrangement could also be amplified from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood and bone marrow DNA, but a VH251 rearranged leukaemic clone representing 0.01% of bone marrow mononuclear cells could be readily detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The application of PCR to detect immunoglobulin gene rearrangement involving VH251 and potentially other preferentially utilized V regions provides a sensitive method both for tracking malignant B cells and for the study of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell developmental pathways through which B lineage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> arise </plain></SENT>
