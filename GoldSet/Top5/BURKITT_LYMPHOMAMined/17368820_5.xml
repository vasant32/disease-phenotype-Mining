<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study assesses the ability of quantitative real-time PCR to measure the effects of virus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38234">DNA polymerase inhibitors</z:chebi> on EBV DNA and late <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> syntheses in EBV-producing cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In-house real-time quantitative PCRs were used to measure EBV DNA (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> (BLLF1 gene/gp350/220, BVRF2 gene/protease) in P3HR-1 and B95-8 cells induced for EBV production by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> and exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi>, cidofovir and foscarnet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The calculated 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)) for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA replication inhibition in P3HR-1 cells after 7 days of drug exposure were 0.28+/-0.06, 0.29+/-0.01 and 13.6+/-0.17 microg/mL for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi>, cidofovir and foscarnet, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EC(50) for B95-8 cells were 0.44+/-0.02, 0.70+/-0.06 and 46.8+/-0.5 microg/mL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The quantitation of the late <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> showed a decrease of 79-89% in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> amount after 4 days of antiviral treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a substantial amount of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> still remained detectable after drug exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The real-time PCR is an improvement in the attempt to simplify EBV DNA-quantitation for antiviral assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The quantitation of late <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> does not appear as more informative than DNA quantitation for the assessment of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38234">DNA polymerase inhibitor</z:chebi> activity, but it may be useful to assess the antiviral activity of drugs acting by another mechanism </plain></SENT>
