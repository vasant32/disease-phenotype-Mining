<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding the precise role of BCL6 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GC formation and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> depends on the identification of genes that are direct targets of its transcriptional repression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that BCL6 directly controls the expression of B7-1/CD80, a costimulatory receptor involved in B-T cell interactions critical for the development of T cell-mediated antibody responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upon CD40 signaling, transcription of the CD80 gene is induced by the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB transcription factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results show that BCL6 prevents CD40-induced expression of CD80 by binding its promoter region in vivo and suppressing its transcriptional activation by NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with a physiologic role for BCL6 in suppressing CD80, the expression of these two genes is mutually exclusive in B cells, and BCL6-defective mice show increased expression of CD80 in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that BCL6 may directly control the ability of B cell to interact with T cells during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GC development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, these findings imply that T-B cell interactions may be disrupted in B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> expressing deregulated BCL6 genes </plain></SENT>
