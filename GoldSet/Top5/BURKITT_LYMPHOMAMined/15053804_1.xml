<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A quantitative nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QN-RT-PCR) method was developed using a plasmid cDNA containing the AML1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> (MTG8) fusion transcript from Kasumi-1 cells, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute-myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> cell line with the t(8;21) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this method, the plasmid was detectable at a concentration of 10(-17) m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fusion transcript in a mixture of 10(7) Rice94 (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line) cells containing two Kasumi-1 cells was detectable at 10(-17) m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a previously published real-time PCR method, the plasmid containing the fusion transcript was detectable at 10(-16) m or higher, and 20 or more Kasumi-1 cells were detectable in 10(7) Rice94 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, this QN-RT-PCR method is more sensitive than the real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the same samples were examined by real-time PCR and our QN-RT-PCR method, in one patient in clinical remission after chemotherapy and allogeneic-bone marrow transplantation (BMT), the transcript was detected by QN-RT-PCR 60 days prior to hematological relapse, in contrast to 10 days before hematological relapse by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The transcript level was below 10(-17) m (undetectable) with this QN-RT-PCR in patients in clinical remission after chemotherapy and BMT, while it was 10(-15)-10(-16) m in patients in clinical remission after chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The quantitative difference of the transcript level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) between these two different types of clinical remission was estimated to be at least 10(2)-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This QN-RT-PCR method is useful for predicting hematological relapse and for quantitatively estimating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> in different types of clinical remission </plain></SENT>
