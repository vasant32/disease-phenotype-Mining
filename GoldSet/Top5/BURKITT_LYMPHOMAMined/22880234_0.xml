<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this review, the revised points in the lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in the fourth edition were summarized from the viewpoint of doctors and medical technologists in clinical laboratories in hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diseases are classified based on information about <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, immunophenotype, genetic features, and clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with 7 recurrent genetic abnormalities is individually classified as a provisional entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is divided into two entities, ALK positive and ALK-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of the former is involved with ALK gene rearrangement with several partner genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two borderline categories between diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and classical Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are newly recognized as a distinct disease entity based on the overlapping morphological and genetic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the diagnosis of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, understanding the morphological features is fundamental </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the importance of immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry to clarify the immunophenotype, and chromosomal analysis and genetic examination to clarify the genetic features has been raised </plain></SENT>
