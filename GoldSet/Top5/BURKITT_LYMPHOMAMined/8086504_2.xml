<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amplification of the IgH CDR-III was observed in 75 of 120 analyzed cases (62.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyzed groups, the IgH gene rearrangement was most often observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> (85.7%) and was rather rare in null-ALL (34.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TCR delta gene rearrangement was the most common, and was observed in 77 patients (64.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The typical pattern of rearrangements was defined as an incomplete V delta 2 to D delta 3, V delta 2 to D delta 2, or D delta 3 to D delta 2 recombination product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements of TCR gamma gene we observed in 61 cases (50.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TCR gamma gene rearrangements were detected predominantly in null-ALL and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> (55.2% and 60%, respectively) and were rather rare in other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight V segments of V gamma I group, the most frequent gene usage concerns regions V gamma 2, V gamma 4, and psi V gamma 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have confirmed that IgH gene amplification, together with TCR gamma and delta gene amplification, provides a rapid, sensitive approach to assessing clonality in ALL almost in 100% of cases </plain></SENT>
