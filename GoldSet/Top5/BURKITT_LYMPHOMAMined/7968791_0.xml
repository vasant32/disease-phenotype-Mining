<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Less commonly appreciated is the potential for the development of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> (TED) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple mechanisms have been implicated for the activation of coagulation in these patients, with an emphasis on the contribution made by the procoagulant properties of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present two cases of patients with pre-B cell ALL, both of whom developed recurrent TED as the presenting manifestation of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and/or heralding relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The blast cells from one of the patients were studied for the presence of procoagulant activity (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) and by Northern blot analysis for tissue factor (TF) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> nor TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> could be identified in highly purified populations of the lymphoblast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that recurrent TED can be a manifestation of ALL and that mechanisms other than the release of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell procoagulants should be sought to explain the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in some patients </plain></SENT>
