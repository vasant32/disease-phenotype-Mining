<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The molecules involved in homotypic aggregation of the human Burkitt-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji were investigated by inhibition of reaggregation with carbohydrates and glycoconjugates, by inhibition of glycosylation, and enzyme treatment of the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete inhibition of reaggregation was achieved with bovine submaxillary mucin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Asialomucin, on the other hand, was not effective in this assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another potent inhibitor of reaggregation was the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> GMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The common carbohydrate structure of these molecules is NeuNAc-(<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi>)-galNAc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="25001">Lactosamine</z:chebi>, fucosyllactosamine, sialyllactosamine, complex <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> type, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1406916" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thomsen</z:e>-Friedenreich antigen sequences are not involved in aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuraminidase and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> also abolished agglutination of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding that mucin, but not asialomucin, inhibits the reaction, demonstrates the importance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Homotypic aggregation was shown to be resistant to trypsin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin we show that N-glycosidically linked carbohydrate chains are involved in aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Swainsonine or castanospermine, which inhibit processing of terminal sialyllactosamines to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> core, did not interfere with the reaction supporting the results of the inhibition assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data presented suggest the involvement of 2 molecules in homotypic aggregation of human Burkitt-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One component is a lectin-like molecule containing N-linked carbohydrate chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The other component carries the neuraminidase-sensitive and trypsin-resistant determinant NeuNAc-(<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi>)-galNAc and, therefore, appears to be a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This proposed lectin-carbohydrate interaction in homotypic aggregation is further supported by the frequently observed dependence of lectins on divalent cations as indicated by inhibition of aggregation with EDTA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30740">EGTA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
