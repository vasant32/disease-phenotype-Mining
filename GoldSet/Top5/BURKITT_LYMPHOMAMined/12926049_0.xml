<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We recently isolated and characterized a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47923">tripeptide</z:chebi>, acetylGlu-Ser-GlyNH2 (Ac-ESG), which inhibits proliferation of lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper we describe the effects of Ac-ESG on growth-related gene expression and cell cycle progression in two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, Ramos and Molt, representing B and T lymphocytes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from Molt and Ramos cells with or without the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47923">tripeptide</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene expression was examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blot hybridization, and cell cycle progression was detected by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the Molt cells, p53 gene expression was increased following treatment while c-myc was decreased after treatment shorter than 24 hours; N-ras expression was significantly reduced at picomolar concentration for 24-hour treatment; cyclinD1 and cdk4 expression did not show any change; DNA flow cytometry demonstrated that Molt cells were arrested or delayed predominantly in G2-M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Untreated Ramos cells had higher gene expression levels of c-myc, N-Ras and cdk4 than Molt cells, but lower p53 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cells were not sensitive to Ac-ESG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47923">tripeptide</z:chebi> Ac-ESG alters the expression of several growth-related genes in the Molt cell line and brings about an arrest or delay of cells in G2-M </plain></SENT>
