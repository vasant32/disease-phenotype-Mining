<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Preliminary clinical trials suggest that <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-131 ((131)I)-labeled anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are effective single agents for the treatment of relapsed non-Hodgkin's B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, despite high initial response rates, most patients treated in this manner will eventually relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that regimens combining (131)I-anti-CD20 antibodies with standard chemotherapeutic agents may provide synergistic anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effects, and may improve the durability of responses in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To identify promising agents for clinical testing, we assessed the in vitro cytotoxicity of combinations of (131)I-anti-B1 (anti-CD20) antibody and 8 chemotherapeutic agents using 2 human CD20-expressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and 2 corroborative assays, the thiazolyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) and the Trypan blue dye exclusion assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ID(50) isobolographic and dose modification factor (DMF) analyses were used to classify interactions between the (131)I-anti-B1 antibody and the chemotherapeutic agents as supra-additive (synergistic), additive or sub-additive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">Cytarabine</z:chebi> and fludarabine were markedly supra-additive when combined with the radioimmunoconjugate, with the combination enhancing cytotoxicity 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>5- to 5.2-fold over the level expected by simple addition of the 2 agents (DMFs 3.5-5.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">Etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and SN-38 were moderately supra-additive (DMFs 2.0-2.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">Cisplatin</z:chebi> and 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide exhibited merely additive cytotoxicity (DMFs 1.0-1.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, combination regimens containing (131)I-labeled anti-CD20 antibodies and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> analogs or topoisomerase inhibitors appear particularly attractive for future clinical trials </plain></SENT>
