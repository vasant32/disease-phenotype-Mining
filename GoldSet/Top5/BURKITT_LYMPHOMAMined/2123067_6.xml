<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surface marker studies of the cell line showed that the cells were positive for HLA-DR, CALLA (CD10), B1 (CD20) and B4 (CD19), but negative for T11 (CD2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fresh cells from peripheral blood of the patient had no surface immunoglobulins, whereas KHM-2B cells were positive for mu.lambda type surface immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cytogenetic analysis of the cell line revealed two translocations, t (8;14) (q24;q32) and t(14;18)(q32;q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement of the c-myc and bcl-2 genes was detected by Southern blot analysis of the KHM-2B DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis revealed production of c-myc and bcl-2 mRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that two oncogenes were activated by two translocations to immunoglobulin genes </plain></SENT>
