<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Initial validation of a seminested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for HER2/neu for use in detecting circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in the peripheral blood or bone marrow of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR assays for other epithelial markers, including the cytokeratins and carcinoembryonic antigen frequently lack specificity, sensitivity, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is a need for an assay that is both sensitive and specific to be used to monitor <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients for micrometastatic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD AND RESULTS: Assay conditions were optimized using the MCF7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cell line and the Raji B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The assay can detect as little as 3 mg of MCF7 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> within a background of 3 mg of Raji <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The assay was positive in 12 of 12 breast <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the 33 peripheral blood or stem cell samples form patients without evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood from 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients was collected immediately before surgery and evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The assay was positive in five of six patients with Stage II, four of eight patients with Stage I and one of three patients with Stage 0 disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The seminested HER2/neu RT-PCR assay compares favorably with RT-PCR assays for other epithelial cell markers in terms of both sensitivity and specificity as a method to detect disseminated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients, the higher the disease stage, the more frequently was the assay positive </plain></SENT>
