<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD154 is a type II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> member of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) ligand family, which is expressed mainly on the surface of activated T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The interaction with its receptor CD40, plays a central role in the control of several functions of the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Structural models based on the homology of CD154 with TNF and lymphotoxin indicate that binding to CD40 involves three regions surrounding amino acids K143, R203 and Q220, and that strands W140-S149 and S198-A210 are critical for such interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, it has been reported that two recombinant CD154 fragments, including amino acid residues Y45-L261 or E108-L261 are biologically active, whereas other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi>, including S149-L261, are not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we decided to construct a fusion protein inserting the W140-S149 amino acid strand (WAEKGYYTMS) in an external loop of the outer membrane protein C (OmpC) from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and assess its ability to bind CD40 and activate B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the chimeric OmpC-gp39 protein conserved its ability to form trimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binding to CD40 was established by three variants of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, a direct binding assay by coating plates with a recombinant CD40-Fc protein and through two competition assays between OmpC-gp39 and recombinant CD154 or soluble CD40-Fc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that OmpC-gp39 increased the expression levels of major histocompatibility complex II, CD23, and CD80, in Raji human B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> similarly to an antibody against CD40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results further support that the CD154/CD40 interaction is similar to the TNF/TNF receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of a <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> fusion protein containing a small amino acid strand form a ligand that is able to activate its cognate receptor </plain></SENT>
