<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were developed for the detection of antibodies to EBV-associated early antigens (EA) and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>-capsid antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibody titers obtained by the ELISA method correlate well with the antibody titers determined by the standard indirect immunofluorescence technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An ELISA developed for the quantitation of early antigens in cell extracts was used to purify a protein of the EA complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, some of the high anti-EA titered sera, as determined by immunofluorescence, did not contain significant amounts of antibodies to this component detectable by the ELISA with immobilized partially purified protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-EA negative sera did not react with the isolated EA component </plain></SENT>
