<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In one of the hybrid clones only a single human chromosome, A2, was consistently present when the hybrid cells were maintained in the selective medium, suggesting that the location of the structural gene for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi>-1-phosphate uridyltransferase is on this chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among subclones derived from this cell hybrid in the absence of selection, a complete concordance was demonstrated between the ability or inability to utilize <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> and the concomitant presence or absence of the human transferase and the A2 chromosome </plain></SENT>
