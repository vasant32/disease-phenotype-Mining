<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The NAB-2 line, which was established from a North American <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumor</z:e>, was indicated to contain one copy of EBV DNA as the integrated form into chromosome 2p13 of the host genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate the integration site of EBV directly, and to clarify the relation between the integration sites and the oncogenes, fragments containing the nucleotide sequence of NAB-2 integration sites were cloned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBV was integrated via the terminal repeats (TR), and integration sites located in the clone RP11-440P5 on chromosome 2, between two oncogenes, REL and BCL11A, which is apart from approximately 350 kbp from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression level of REL in NAB-2 was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The flanking region of chromosome 2 at the bilateral junction sites showed no homology to the junction sites of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The integration site 2p13 overlaps with common fragile site, FRA2E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NAB-2 cells expressed almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> latent genes but LMP-2A that flanks the TR, indicating the type III of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Integration event in NAB-2 might alter the regulation of the oncogenes and provide advantage for continuous cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
