<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the induction of Fc receptor (FcR) in different types of lymphoid cell lines (LCL) infected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus (HSV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subpopulations of certain of these LCL normally express FcR unrelated to herpetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differentiation of virus-induced FcR from that related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell function was therefore possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FcR detection was carried out by means of a rosette assay using ox erythrocytes coated with 7S immunoglobulin G (EA rosettes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both HSV types 1 and 2 were found to induce FcR in B, T, and "null" (i.e., non-B, non-T) type LCL; however, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the LCL tested, this HSV-induced FcR expression appeared to be more restricted in the responding T LCL than in responding B and null type LCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, kinetic experiments revealed that the time course of HSV-induced FcR expression differed among these LCL types tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a number of LCL were resistant to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1504513" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HSV infection</z:e> or restricted HSV gene expression, including expression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> products responsible for FcR induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the responding HSV-infected LCL, induction of FcR always paralleled the expression of HSV antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Synthesis of HSV-induced FcR was shown to be inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15732">phosphonoacetic acid</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of herpesvirus DNA polymerase activity, whereas FcR of non-HSV origin was found to be resistant to inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This would infer that HSV codes for an FcR which can be differentiated from that of cellular origin by using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15732">phosphonoacetic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, two different mechanisms of FcR synthesis may be suggested, one virus mediated and the second probably under cellular control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the data obtained using Epstein-Barr virus producer as well as isogeneic monoclonal cell lines, with and without the Epstein-Barr virus genome, indicated that the resident Epstein-Barr virus genome in the target cell did not have a detectable effect in the induction of FcR by HSV </plain></SENT>
