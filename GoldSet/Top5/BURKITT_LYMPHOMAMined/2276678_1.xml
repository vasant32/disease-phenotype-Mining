<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This method overcomes some limitations intrinsic to the widely employed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release assay and always shows a higher degree of sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No inhibition of colony growth was found when the effector cells were plated without prior pre-incubation with interleukin 2 or with the addition of the medium derived from the LAK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Though more time-consuming than the classic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release assay, this technique does not require radioactive material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This test may be suitable for a more precise evaluation of LAK activity and for the study of the mechanisms involved in cell killing </plain></SENT>
