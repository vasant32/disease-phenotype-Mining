<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate cardiac involvement in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) we reviewed serial electrocardiograms, chest X-rays and cardiac pathology at autopsy in 45 consecutive adult patients undergoing BMT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY, 120 mg/kg) and total body irradiation (TBI, 10-12 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 patients developed electrocardiographic ST-segment or T-wave changes and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> post-BMT; four of them also suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> included frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>ventricular extrasystoles</z:hpo> (two patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (one patient), repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (one patient) and QT-prolongation with ventricular tachyarrhythmias (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients showed an early drop of the total QRS voltage sum exceeding 15% of the pretransplant reading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of five patients the voltage drop was associated with ST-segment or T-wave changes; three of them developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At autopsy in 15 patients, the heart weight was on the average 113% of predicted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005482'>cellular hypertrophy</z:mp> were the most common microscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had marantic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> of the aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, in our experience clinically significant heart involvement affects 5-10% of patients undergoing BMT after pretreatment with CY and TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While cardiac complications are generally not a major problem of BMT, they may have serious consequences for individual patients and should therefore be carefully watched for in the treatment of BMT recipients </plain></SENT>
