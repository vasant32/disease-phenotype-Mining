<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule expression, such as loss of expression, de novo expression or functional alterations, can be observed in each of these steps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present work was to study the expression of two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules [standard CD44 (CD44s) and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1)] and the soluble form of ICAM-1(sICAM-1) in adult disseminated non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (D-NHL) and to correlate the findings with overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of CD44s and ICAM-1 adhesion molecules and the level of sICAM-1 were studied in 34 cases of (D-NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They included: 13 cases of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LBL), 5 cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), one case of diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL), 14 cases of small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>), one case of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten apparently healthy individuals were taken as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD44s expression was evaluated by direct immunofluoresence, ICAM-1 by immunoperoxidase on cyto-preps and serum level of sICAM-1 by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ICAM-1 was positive in 6/34 cases (17.6%) of D-NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ICAM-1 was expressed in 2/15 (13.3%) of low-grade NHL and 4/19 (21%) of high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with no significant difference between the two groups (p=0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD44s was expressed in 13/34 cases (38.2%) of D-NHL; in 4/15 (26.6%) of low grade NHL and 9/19 (47.3%) of high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with no significant difference between the two groups (p=0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of sICAM-1 were elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with D-NHL compared to healthy controls with a statistically significant difference (p &lt;0.001), (median 1160 ng/ml, range from 150 to 2500 ng/ml, and 375 ng/ml, range from 270 to 620 ng/ml, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median of sICAM-1 in patients with high-grade D-NHL was significantly (p=0.006) lower than that of those with low-grade D-NHL (median 890 ng/ml, range from 150 to 1540 ng/ml and 1440 ng/ml, range from 380 to 2500 ng/ml respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up duration for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No statistical significant difference was achieved (p=0.8) on comparing overall survival pattern between D-NHL <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients with positive or negative expression of ICAM-1 or sCD44 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Also, no statistically significant difference (p=0.9) was found between patients with sICAM (above and below 600 ng/ml) at 18 months from diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (CAM) expression in NHL and this may correlate with degree of differentiation of malignant lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However the exact significance of these findings will require functional studies to determine the role of these CAMs in each subtype of NHL </plain></SENT>
