<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have now determined the nucleotide sequence of the LMP-1 gene of a type 2 isolate of EBV, AG876 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the AG876 LMP-1 protein is 93% identical to the prototype type 1 EBV strain B95-8, and this is well within the range of variability previously noted among type 1 EBV LMP-1 genes </plain></SENT>
