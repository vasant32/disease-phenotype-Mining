<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop a LightCycler-based real-time PCR assay for monitoring the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA load in unfractionated whole blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This assay was compared with quantitative competitive PCR (Q-PCR) for EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LightCycler-based assay was highly sensitive and reproducible when quantifying plasmid DNA in either the presence or absence of healthy donor blood DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Amplifying plasmid DNA in DNA backgrounds from different donors slightly increased the variation of quantification, indicating that clinical specimen DNA has an influence on quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In most transplant recipients, a good correlation was observed between EBV DNA load dynamics determined by LightCycler and Q-PCR in follow-up samples, although the correlation between absolute values of EBV DNA loads was weak and occasional samples were false negative in the LightCycler assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 253 cross-sectional blood samples from patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e>, or human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e>, a weak but significant correlation between the two methods was found (r(2) = 0.37, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the clinical specimen DNA background may influence the absolute values of EBV DNA load in LightCycler analyses but that this effect is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LightCycler PCR is very well suited for monitoring of EBV DNA load dynamics, and its diagnostic value is comparable to that of Q-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To avoid false negativity or underestimation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load, future internal calibration of the LightCycler is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This would also enhance EBV load assay standardization and interinstitute comparisons </plain></SENT>
