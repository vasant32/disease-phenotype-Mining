<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histological investigation revealed that it was a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructures of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells showed immature lymphoid features with frequent <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplets within the cytoplasms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Virological studies before the treatment revealed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was closely related to EB <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e>, being positive for EBNA (more than 95% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells) and IgG antibodies to VCA (X 5,120), EA (X 640), and EBNA (X 160) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells exhibited low levels of cytoplasmic IgM and other properties of B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were positively stained with L26, L27, Leu 14, and HLA-DR MAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cultured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, L25 and CALLA antigens were demonstrated, but no surface Ig was shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were negative for T cell markers including AcP, E-receptor, and Leu 1, 2, and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies demonstrated that the karyotype of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells was 46, XY, dup (1q), t(2;8)/46, X, -Y, t(2;8), +mar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VEMP therapy was immediately conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, following a two-month partial remission, a relapse with bone marrow infiltration occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, a case of Japanese Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with EBNA (+) and t(2;8) properties is described, and the relationships among primary sites, phenotypes, and genotypes are discussed </plain></SENT>
