<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) has a relatively high incidence in Chinese living in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and South China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better understand this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, we have established several new NPC cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We collected biopsy specimens from suspected NPC patients and divided each specimen into two parts: the first part was fixed for routine histopathologic examination, and the other part was put into culture medium for primary culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Once the cell lines were established, they were extensively characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven NPC cell lines were established, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> have been passaged more than 100 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two lines were derived from keratinizing <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and five from undifferentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic examination revealed that both dark and light <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells contained intermediate filaments with clear desmosome formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average doubling time ranged from 10.7 to 16.3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic analysis showed multiple chromosome abnormalities with the average chromosome number between 84 and 95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colony forming efficiency in soft agar was 18-42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines could induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> mass formation when transplanted into <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice, and the histopathological findings showed two keratinizing and five nonkeratinizing <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines contained less acidic keratin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> than basic keratin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Strong expression of vimentin in each single cell of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The oncosuppressor <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> gene in each cell line showed no remarkable abnormality, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein was abnormally expressed in some interphase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The oncogenes, erbB and c-fgr, were both normally expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>While the c-myc oncogene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines was overexpressed when compared with the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji Cell line, the c-myc DNA sequence in each cell line showed neither amplification nor rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The newly established seven NPC cell lines have been well characterized, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed overexpression of c-myc oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The oncosuppressor <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> gene revealed no remarkable rearrangement, but its protein product was abnormal in certain interphase cells of each cell line </plain></SENT>
