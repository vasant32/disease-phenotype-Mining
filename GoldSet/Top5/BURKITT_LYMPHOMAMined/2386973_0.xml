<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pattern of immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement and the genomic structure of the Myc locus were investigated in the DNA of 20 lymphnode biopsies of patients suffering from lymphoadenopathy-associated syndrome (LAS) and from 3 patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although polyclonality was the prevalent pattern of Ig gene rearrangement observed in LAS, in 30% of the cases discrete bands of Ig heavy chain gene rearrangement were identifiable due to the presence of monoclonal or oligoclonal cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, structural alterations of the Myc gene were not detected in any cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As expected, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> studied, the lymphnode DNA displayed a clonal pattern of Ig heavy chain gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Myc was altered in two cases, which presented a truncation of the gene beginning within a very short region of the first intron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the breakpoint positions on chromosome 14 mapped in different regions of the Ig loci, which in both cases involved the switch (SH) area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data confirm the relatively common occurrence of oligoclonal expansions within B cells in LAS and the frequent involvement of the Myc oncogene in the process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> in individuals positive for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) </plain></SENT>
