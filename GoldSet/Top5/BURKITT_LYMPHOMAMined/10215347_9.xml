<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Denis Burkitt first published an account of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> that bears his name in 1958.1 In the following years, there was considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> concerning the nature of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, its relationship to other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and whether it occurred outside Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify this matter, the World Health Organization, in collaboration with the International Agency for Research on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>, convened a meeting of 18 hematopathologists in Washington in October 1967 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histological and cytological preparations from 55 selected cases were circulated to the participants before the meeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conclusions of the majority of the participants were that "the eponym <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumour</z:e> is best applied to a malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> of the haemopoietic system composed of a predominant and characteristic cell type," and that "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumour</z:e>, as defined above, is not limited to Africa and occurs in many parts of the world."2 Two members of the group (Dr Iris Hamlin and Dr Philip Lieberman) dissented from this view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were of the opinion that Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) is a clinicopathological concept only and does not exist in a specific histological or cytological sense </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As so often happens in the history of medicine, time has shown both groups to have truth on their side </plain></SENT>
