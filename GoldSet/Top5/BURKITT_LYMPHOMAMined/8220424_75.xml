<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have screened the entire coding region of c-myc in a panel of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>) and mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> (PCTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Contrary to the belief that c-myc is <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, we found that 65% of 57 BLs and 30% of 10 PCTs tested exhibit at least one amino acid (aa) substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These mutations were apparently homozygous in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines tested and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> biopsies, implying that the mutations often occur before Myc/Ig translocation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In PCTs, only the mutant c-myc allele was expressed indicating a functional homozygosity, but occurrence of mutations after the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many of the observed mutations are clustered in regions associated with transcriptional activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>, they frequently occur at sites of phosphorylation, suggesting that the mutations have a pathogenetic role </plain></SENT>
