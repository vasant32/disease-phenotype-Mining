<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we report the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-inhibitory activity of a series of p21waf1/cip1 (p21) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> fragments spanning the whole protein against the cyclin D1/Cdk4 and cyclin E/Cdk2 enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most potent p21 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> tested in our initial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> series, designated W10, spanned amino acids 139 to 164, a region of p21 that has been found independently to bind to proliferating cell nuclear antigen and also to inhibit Cdk activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We go on to report the importance of putative beta-strand and 3(10)-helix motifs in the W10 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> for cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also describe the cellular activity of W10 and derivatives that were chemically linked to an antennapedia <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, the latter segment acting as a cell membrane carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the W10AP <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> exhibited growth inhibition that resulted from <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> CA46 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, regions in the W10 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> responsible for Cdk-inhibition were also important for the degree of this cellular activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies provide insights that may eventually, through further design, yield agents for the therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
