<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Physical interaction between human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and murine bone marrow derived stromal cells were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nalm-6 pre-B cells adhered to BMS2 stromal cells and subsequently migrated beneath them, while Ramos Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, adhered but did not migrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four mAbs were established against Nalm-6 cells, which were able to block initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of Nalm-6 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of them were directed against the alpha 4 chain of VLA-4, and other two recognized the beta 1 chain of VLA integrins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of Ramos and Nalm-6 cells to BMS2 was largely mediated by the VLA-4 integrin expressed on lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The corresponding ligand on stromal cells appears to be VCAM-1, because antibodies against murine VCAM-1 blocked the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, antibodies against the alpha chain of VLA-4 were not capable of blocking subsequent migration beneath stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, antibodies against the beta chain of VLA integrins blocked the migration beneath stromal cells as well as the initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because a common beta chain can be shared among integrins, the role of other VLA integrins in Nalm-6 cells migration was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VLA-5 and VLA-6 as well as VLA-4 were expressed on Nalm-6 cells, but not on Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional blocking experiments revealed that VLA-4 and VLA-5 are likely to work in concert to mediate the migration of Nalm-6 cells beneath stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, particular VLA integrins appear to be responsible not only for lymphocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> but also for migration with respect to stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings may have implications for cell-cell interactions and directed migration of lymphocytes in bone marrow and other tissues </plain></SENT>
