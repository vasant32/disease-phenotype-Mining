<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The insolation <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> vanished completely, but was reactivated after three days much more severely than the original sunburn, and healed slowly over three weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reactivation phenomenon has previously been described in man and in the guinea pig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It differs substantially from "radiation recall" caused by other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> drugs, as sunburn is not enhanced by MTX applied simultaneously with insolation and is not reactivated if MTX is given more than a week later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previously irradiated skin regions are spared from the reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the phenomenon is not prevented by CF, it can probably be understood as enhanced MTX toxicity to the hyperproliferating basal cell layer of skin after insolation damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MTX should therefore not be applied for one week after sunburn </plain></SENT>
