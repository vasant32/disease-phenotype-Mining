<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells, which are thought to be related to germinal center B cells, to examine the biological effect of Ab-mediated CD24 cross-linking on human B cells and observed 1) induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells mediated by cross-linking of CD24; and 2) synergism between the cross-linking of CD24 and that of the B cell receptor for Ag in the effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also observed activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases following CD24 cross-linking, suggesting that CD24 mediates the intracellular signaling that leads to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although CD24 has no cytoplasmic portion to transduce signals intracellularly, analysis of biochemically separated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi>-enriched membrane (GEM) fractions indicated enhanced association of CD24 and Lyn protein tyrosine kinase in GEM as well as increased Lyn kinase activity after CD24 cross-linking, suggesting that CD24 mediates intracellular signaling via a GEM-dependent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specific microscopic cocapping of CD24 and Lyn, but not of other kinases, following CD24 cross-linking supported this idea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further observed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction by cross-linking is a common feature shared by GEM-associated molecules expressed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, including GPI-anchored proteins and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
