<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several enhancers have been shown to be important for expression of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four enhancer regions (murine-hypersensitive sites (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MHS</z:e>) 1, 2, 3, and 4) located 3' of the murine immunoglobulin heavy chain gene play a role in activating expression of the translocated c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The enhancer regions also result in a shift in transcriptional initiation from the P2 promoter to P1 that is characteristic of the translocated c-myc allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the most 3' enhancer region (MHS4) activated the c-myc promoter by 46-fold in the Raji Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, and it was the most active enhancer in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The addition of enhancer regions <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MHS1</z:e>,2 and 3 to MHS4 increased c-myc transcription by an additional 3-fold and resulted in the full promoter shift from P2 to P1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By deletion analysis of enhancer region MHS4, we located a region that was critical for the transcriptional activity of MHS4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis revealed that NF-kappaB/Rel family members bound to this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutation of the NF-kappaB binding site abolished both the enhancer activity and the promoter shift activity of MHS4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An active NF-kappaB site was also identified in the human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30607,30610">HS4</z:chebi> enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of c-myc promoter activity driven by the immunoglobulin enhancers was observed with expression of a super-repressor IkappaBalpha construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the NF-kappaB/Rel transcription factors play an important role in the deregulation of the translocated c-myc gene in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and suggest that interference with NF-kappaB function may represent a new approach to the treatment of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
