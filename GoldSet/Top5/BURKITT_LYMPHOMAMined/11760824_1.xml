<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The advantages of nucleic acid testing include enhanced specificity and sensitivity, ease of sample procurement, and more rapid turnaround time compared to conventional laboratory testing methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the cost of testing is usually higher due to the need for additional laboratory space, specialized equipment, safety apparel, and the need for highly trained personnel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most nucleic acid techniques currently used in a clinical setting can be categorized as either hybridization or amplification assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hybridization assays, including blotting techniques and microarrays, involve the complementary binding of an oligonucleotide probe of known DNA sequence with nucleic acid derived from the patient sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To amplify small amounts of nucleic acid, assays such as the polymerase chain reaction and branched chain DNA employ either signal amplification or exponential amplification of target nucleic acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical applications of nucleic acid testing involve the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e>, e.g., sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington disease</z:e>; and identification of infectious agents, e.g., HCV and HIV; or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantitative molecular assays also play important roles in predicting prognosis and monitoring responsiveness to therapy </plain></SENT>
