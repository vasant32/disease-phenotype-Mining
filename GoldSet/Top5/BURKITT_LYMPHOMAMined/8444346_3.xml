<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, KOBK101, the immunoglobulin kappa-encoding gene on chromosome 2, accompanied by its enhancer, was translocated to the pvt-1 locus located about 250 kb downstream from c-myc on chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only the c-myc allele on the translocated chromosome carried aberrant SalI and KpnI sites in the first intron, so the two c-myc alleles and their transcripts were analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The c-myc allele on the untranslocated chromosome conserved the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc sequence and was transcriptionally silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the c-myc allele on the translocated chromosome was actively transcribed at three- to fivefold higher levels, as compared with non-malignant B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it carried predominant multiple mutations consisting of 64 nucleotide substitutions, three short deletions, and a one-base insertion, most of which clustered in the first exon and intron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 24-base deletion in the first intron completely overlapped the binding site of a putative negative transcriptional factor of the 138-kDa phosphoprotein, MIF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the multiple mutations and the deregulated, allele-specific expression of c-myc were associated with the chromosomal translocation in cis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together activation by the long-distance immunoglobulin kappa enhancer, and the alleviation of negative regulation by the mutations, seemed to cause the allele-specific activation of c-myc </plain></SENT>
