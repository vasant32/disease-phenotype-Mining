<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a highly sensitive assay to quantify leukemic progenitor cells (LPCs) in the bone marrow of such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiparameter flow cytometry and blast colony assays were used to detect LPCs in the bone marrow of 31 pediatric B-lineage ALL patients with an isolated extramedullary first relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sites of relapse were central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (22 patients), testes (7 patients), and eye (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) LPC counts ranged from 0/10(6) mononuclear cells (MNCs) to 356/10(6) MNCs (mean +/- SE, 27.8+/-13.1/10(6) MNCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LPCs were undetectable in 19 patients (61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BM LPC burden at the time of extramedullary relapse was similar, regardless of site (Wilcoxon P = 0.77) or time of relapse (Wilcoxon P = 0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with higher risk, standard risk at initial diagnosis showed a trend for increased BM LPC burden (mean +/- SE, 44.6+/-17.1 versus 7.5+/-3.3; Wilcoxon P = 0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After successful postrelapse induction chemotherapy, LPC counts in 21 evaluated patients ranged from 0/10(6) to 175/10(6) MNCs (mean +/- SE, 15.9+/-9.6/10(6) MNCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By comparison, LPC burden was higher after successful induction chemotherapy among children with an early BM relapse (range, 0 to 3262/ 106 MNC; mean +/- SE, 166+/-107; Wilcoxon P = 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with an extramedullary relapse have occult systemic failure with substantial involvement of the bone marrow, and after reinduction therapy, LPC counts were lower in these patients than in patients treated for an overt BM first relapse </plain></SENT>
