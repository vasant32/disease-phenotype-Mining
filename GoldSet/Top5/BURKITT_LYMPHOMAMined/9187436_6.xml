<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With a previous protocol including <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> prophylaxis, 40% of our adult patients achieved CR and only 13% became long survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1988, following this poor experience, we adopted a very intensive pediatric-derived protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one consecutive patients, 8 adults (median age 35, stage III: 1; IV: 7; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>: 6) and 13 children (median age 10, state III: 8; IV: 5; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>: 4) were treated with the same protocol (POG 8617), based on alternate two-phase cycles with sequential high-dose <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>, VCR, ADM + <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> chemoprophylaxis (phase A) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> MTX + HiDAC (phase B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adults received 6 cycles, children 8; i.t. prophylaxis in phase B was omitted in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty of 21 (95%) patients achieved CR (adults 100%, children 92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients died early; 2 relapsed at 4 and 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 28 months (4-96), 17 patients (81%) are event free (adults 75%, children 85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> affected 62% of adults and 15% of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) The prognosis of adult advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> definitely improved with this intensive protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(2) There were no differences in outcome between adults and children </plain></SENT>
