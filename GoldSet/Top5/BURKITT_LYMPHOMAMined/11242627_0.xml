<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PICTURE: We report a case of a patient with Burkitt's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> who developed ATLS after treatment with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TREATMENT: Standard preventive measures using aggressive hydration, urine alkalinisation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35841">uricosuric agents</z:chebi> were instituted before chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
