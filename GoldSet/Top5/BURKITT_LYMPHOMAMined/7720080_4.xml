<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Natural cytotoxicity was inhibited approximately 26% by 1 mM ATP and 21% by 1 mM <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="22263">5'-Adenylyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48497">imidodiphosphate</z:chebi>, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, inhibited natural cytotoxicity by 41% at a concentration of 1 mM and &gt; 97% at a concentration of 10 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> was not inhibitory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> was a weak inhibitor of natural cytotoxicity and may represent an alternate regulatory pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Removal of the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> resulted in the restoration of control levels of natural cytotoxicity activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The affinity label 5'-p-(fluorosulfonyl)benzoyladenosine (5'-FSBA) is a synthetic analog of ATP or <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> containing an electrophilic fluorosulfonyl group capable of covalently modifying proteins at <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> di- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nucleotide-binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Natural cytotoxicity was irreversibly inhibited by modification of the extracellular membrane of NK3.3 cells by 5'-FSBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This inhibition was concentration dependent with an I50 approximately 100 microM and complete inhibition at 1 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Modification of NK3.3 by 5'-FSBA did not affect the formation of effector-target cell conjugates; however, granule release was inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This targets the site of inhibition by 5'-FSBA modification to a pathway preceding granule release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Irreversible, covalent modification of surface <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> nucleotide-binding proteins by 5'-FSBA provides a probe to study the role of specific <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> nucleotide-binding proteins in the extracellular regulation of natural killer cytolytic activity by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
