<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of action of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (RA) is of broad relevance to cell and developmental biology, nutrition, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RA is known to induce expression of the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> receptor 1 (BLR1) gene which propels RA-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 human myeloblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, motivating the present analysis of transcriptional regulation of blr1 expression by RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The RA-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells used here expressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> RA receptor (RAR) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> X receptor (RXR) subtypes (as detected by Northern analysis) except RXRgamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with RAR- and RXR-selective ligands showed that RARalpha synergized with RXRalpha to transcriptionally activate blr1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 5'-flanking region capable of supporting RA-induced blr1 activation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells was found to contain a 205-bp sequence in the distal portion that was necessary for transcriptional activation by RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within this sequence DNase I footprinting revealed that RA induced binding of a nuclear protein complex to an element containing two GT boxes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) and supershift assays showed that this element bound recombinant RARalpha and RXRalpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Without RA there was neither complex binding nor transcriptional activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both GT boxes were needed for binding the complex, and mutation of either GT box caused the loss of transcriptional activation by RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ability of this cis-acting RAR-RXR binding element to activate transcription in response to RA also depended on downstream sequences where an octamer transcription factor 1 (Oct1) site and a nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc) site between this element and the transcriptional start, as well as a cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> response element binding factor (CREB) site between the transcriptional start and first exon of the blr1 gene, were necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Each of these sites bound its corresponding transcription factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A transcription factor-transcription factor binding array analysis of nuclear lysate from RA-treated cells indicated several prominent RARalpha binding partners; among these, Oct1, NFATc3, and CREB2 were identified by competition EMSA and supershift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays as components of the complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RA upregulated expression of these three factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In sum the results of the present study indicate that RA-induced expression of blr1 expression depends on a novel RA response element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This cis-acting element approximately 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start consists of two GT boxes that bind RAR and RXR in a nuclear protein complex that also contains Oct1, NFATc3, and CREB2 bound to their cognate downstream consensus binding sites </plain></SENT>
