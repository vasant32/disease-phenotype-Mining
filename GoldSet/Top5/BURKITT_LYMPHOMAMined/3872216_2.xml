<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The accessory function (AF) of various B cell lines has been investigated by studying their ability to replace monocytes inducing the proliferation of highly purified T lymphocytes in the presence of phytohemagglutinin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AF could be exerted by B cells from different origin, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>)-derived lines, either EBV-positive or not, pre-B and B <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EBV-converted BJAB-B95 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells could exert an AF as efficient as BJAB cells, their EBV-negative counterparts, which demonstrates that EBV itself does not play any role in this function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HLA-DR antigen-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-K562 hybrids PUTKO and DUTKO, T51.4.1.6 cells which derived from an HLA-DR-negative variant of the T51 LCL and 721.84.5 cells from a mutagenically dissected HLA-DR-negative clone of the 721 LCL, also exerted very efficient AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>721 LCL, PUTKO and DUTKO hybrids could produce interleukin 1 activity when triggered with 12-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="45127">phorbol 13-acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, addition of anti-DR monoclonal antibodies which blocked completely the AF of the B cell lines in mixed lymphocyte-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell reaction did not affect the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-triggered AF exerted by the same B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The induction of cellular differentiation with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> markedly reduced the AF exerted by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B cell lines studied as well as by the hybrid cells DUTKO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the PUTKO hybrid was unsensitive to <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> treatments, which were unable to abrogate its AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data indicate that the AF in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-induced T lymphocyte responses is dependent upon some precise maturational stages of accessory cells and HLA-DR antigen expression is not required for AF in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-induced proliferation assays </plain></SENT>
