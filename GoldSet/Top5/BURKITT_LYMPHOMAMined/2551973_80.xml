<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The evidence linking EBV etiologically to these disorders includes the presence of EBV DNA and nuclear antigens in the lesions and serologic evidence that some patients with these lesions are experiencing primary or reactivated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These syndromes may represent proliferation of cells latently infected with EBV, but the possibility of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication has not been rigorously studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA extracted from biopsies of 35 lymphoproliferative diseases was probed with regions of the EBV genome capable of distinguishing circular, episomal DNA found in latency from linear, replicating EBV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples contained restriction fragments characteristic of fused termini, indicative of circular, latent genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen samples contained additional restriction fragments diagnostic of linear EBV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, replicating EBV DNA is found in approximately 40% of EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
