<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latent membrane protein (LMP1) encoded by EBV is expressed in the majority of EBV-associated human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and has been suggested to be one of the major oncogenic factors in EBV-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, genetic manipulation of LMP1 expression may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of the EBV-associated human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes) are catalytic nucleic acids that bind and cleave a target <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in a highly sequence-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have designed several LMP1-specific DNAzymes and tested their effect on cell proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in LMP1-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that active DNAzymes down-regulated the expression of the EBV oncoprotein LMP1 and inhibited cellular signal transduction pathways abnormally activated by LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This down-regulation of the LMP1 expression was shown to be associated with a decrease in the level of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and an increase in Caspase-3 and -9 activities in the nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line CNE1-LMP1, which constitutively expresses the LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When combined with radiation treatment, the DNAzymes significantly induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in CNE1-LMP1 cells, leading to an increased radiosensitivity both in cells and in a xenograft NPC model in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that LMP1 may represent a molecular target for DNAzymes and provide a basis for the use of the LMP1 DNAzymes as potential radiosensitizers for treatment of the EBV-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
