<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Together with the characteristic chromosomal translocation that constitutively activates the c-Myc oncogene, alterations in cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor pathways are additionally required in order to allow the cells to overcome anti-oncogenic barriers and proliferate in an uncontrolled manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The INK4a/ARF locus on chromosome 9p21 is considered a safeguard locus since it encodes the two important <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor proteins, p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By regulating the p53 and Rb pathways p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) respectively act as pro-apoptotic and cell cycle inhibitor proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The importance of the INK4a/ARF locus has been well documented in several human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> as well as in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanisms responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the INK4a/ARF locus have been thoroughly characterized, less is known about its posttranscriptional control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study we found that p16(INK4a) and p14(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Arf</z:e>) are concurrently inactivated in a panel of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that along with the epigenetic silencing of the p16INK4a gene, the complete inactivation of the locus is achieved by the improper turnover of INK4/ARF proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), as the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> MG-132 blocks p14(ARF) degradation and induces a dramatic stabilization of the p16(INK4a) protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We establish that the simultaneous deregulation of both DNA methylation patterns and the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis system is required to completely inactive the INK4/ARF locus, opening new prospects for the understanding and treatment of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
