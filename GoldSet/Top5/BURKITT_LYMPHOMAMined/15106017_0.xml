<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To clarify the role of the pathways dependent on protein-kinase C (PK-C) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin (CaM) in the regulation of telomerase activity in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (Raji and Daudi) were treated with the PK-C inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), or the CaM inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45951">trifluoperazine</z:chebi> (TFPZ), in a dose-dependent manner and in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activities of PK-C isoenzymes were analyzed fluorimetrically using POLARIS assay kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CaM-kinase II activity was analyzed radiographically, using CaMK-II immunoprecipitation kinase assay kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Telomerase activity was detected by a conventional telomeric repeat amplification protocol and Stretch PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT) in drug-treated and nontreated cells was analyzed by flow cytometry using anti-hTERT antibody labeled with ZenonAlexa <z:chebi fb="2" ids="24061">Fluor</z:chebi>-488 IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was estimated in terms of phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface and DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was found that BIM inhibited telomerase activity and this process preceded <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The subsequent addition of exogenous PK-C (mixture of isoenzymes) to the cell lysates restored telomerase activity if incubation of cells with BIM was up to 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using PK-C isoenzymes, it was established that atypical PK-Czeta, but not conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> -dependent PK-Calpha, PK-Cbeta or PK-Cgamma, is responsible for the reactivation of telomerase in BIM-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BIM also showed a well-expressed cytotoxicity against intact <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the CaM inhibitor TFPZ showed the same cytotoxic effect without any influence on telomerase activity during incubation for 24 h with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After incubation for 48 h, TFPZ markedly suppressed telomerase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the effect followed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and appeared to be a result of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The addition of exogenous CaMK-II to the cell lysates obtained from TFPZ-treated cells did not reactivate telomerase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study confirmed the participation of atypical PK-Czeta, but not conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> -dependent PK-C isoenzymes (alpha, beta, gamma) nor the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/CaM-dependent pathway, in the regulation of telomerase activity in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
