<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of microwave antigen retrieval performed in a pressure cooker and proteolytic digestion with trypsin, we were able to demonstrate immunoglobulin light chain restriction in 66 B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> comprising 25 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 29 diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 6 small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 2 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 1 nodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1 hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was concordance of results in 13 cases in which flow cytometry immunoglobulin analyzes were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perinuclear staining was demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with dot-like staining of the Golgi present in 23 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perinuclear staining occurred in combination with cytoplasmic staining in 12 cases and membrane staining in 8 cases with 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showing more than two patterns of staining </plain></SENT>
