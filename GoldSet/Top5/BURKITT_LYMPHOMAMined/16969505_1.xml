<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the function of cell surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> in exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37550">sphingosine-1-phosphate</z:chebi> (S-1-P) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16393">sphingosine</z:chebi>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-2 human diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were incubated with or without Vibrio Cholerae neuraminidase followed by S-1-P or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16393">sphingosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis using Limax flavus agglutinin, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi>-specific lectin, showed that sialylated glycoconjugates are present on the surface of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-2 cells and that they were removed by neuraminidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the pretreatment with neuraminidase enhanced S-1-P- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16393">sphingosine</z:chebi>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, an effect that was not dependent on caspase activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by S-1-P and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16393">sphingosine</z:chebi> was morphologically distinct from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further examined S-1-P-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in two clones of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-8 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with different amounts of cell surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clone 3G3, which is hypersialylated, was less sensitive to S-1-P than the 3D2 clone, which is hyposialylated, suggesting that the extent of surface sialylation influences the sensitivity to S-1-P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, S-1-P and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16393">sphingosine</z:chebi> induce cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and the sensitivity of human B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to these agents appears to depend on the amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> on their cell surfaces </plain></SENT>
