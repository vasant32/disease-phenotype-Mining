<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> by examining the levels of antibodies against <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid (VCA-IgG and VCAvIgM) and Epstein Barr nuclear antibody (EBNA-TgG) in the serum of children with IM syndrome (patient group) and the serum of unaffected children (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This longitudinal case-control study was performed on thirty one children between I to T4 years old who were admitted to the pediatric ward of Rasool Akram hospital; based on diagnostic parameters for TM within two years( 1998-2000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fortheen patients were eliminated due to other diagnosis .The average age of remaining T7 patients was 6.9+/-3.3, male/female ratio 9/8.The results of this study showed a significant difference (p 0.03 8)between the amount of EBNA-TgG but no significant difference in the amount of VCA-IgG,VCA-TgM between case and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is no difference between case and control groups in negative values for VCA- 1gM ,VCA -TgG and EBNA-TgG </plain></SENT>
