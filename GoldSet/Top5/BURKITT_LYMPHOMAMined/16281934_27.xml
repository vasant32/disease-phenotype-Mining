<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to generate a transcriptional profile of relapsed ALL to increase our understanding of the mechanisms involved in therapy failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from 11 pairs of cryopreserved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> bone marrow specimens taken from the same patients at diagnosis and relapse, and analysed using HG-U133A microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relapse specimens overexpressed genes that are involved with cell growth and proliferation, in keeping with their aggressive phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When tested in 72 independent specimens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>, the identified genes could successfully differentiate between diagnosis and relapse in either lineage, indicating the existence of relapse mechanisms common to both </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of the top-ranked gene (BSG) at diagnosis was significantly associated with adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several chromosomal loci, including 19p13, were identified as potential hotspots for aberrant gene expression in relapsed ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results provide evidence for a link between drug resistance and the microenvironment that has previously only been considered in the context of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumour</z:e> biology </plain></SENT>
