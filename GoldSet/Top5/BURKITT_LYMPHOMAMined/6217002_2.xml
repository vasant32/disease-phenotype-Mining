<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the interactions between circulating immune complexes (CIC) and lymphoid cells in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002613'>biliary cirrhosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e>), we determined (1) whether antibodies to lymphocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e> serum, independent of CIC, could account for binding in the Raji cell assay for CIC and (2) whether CIC or other humoral factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e> serum could interact with lymphoid cells to alter their function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that three quarters of CIC positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e> sera bound specifically to Raji cells via complement receptors, while only one quarter had antibodies to lymphoid cells or Raji cells devoid of complement receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated factors which inhibited cell-mediated cytotoxicity and suppressor cell activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e> sera; however, we found no correlation between the level and presence of CIC or of lymphocyte antibodies and the level or presence of these serum inhibitory factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, although the detection of CIC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e> is not artifactual, the contribution of CIC and other serum factors to the other immunological aberrations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e> remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
