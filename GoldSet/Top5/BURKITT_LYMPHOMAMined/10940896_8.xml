<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A model for the aggressive form of this entity was generated by xenotransplantation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice with human peripheral blood leukocytes from individuals with prior contact with EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This model, where large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> occurs, was used to test the hypothesis that IL-6 has a major role in EBV-induced B cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-6 is known to differentiate B cells into immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells and induce EBV replication, and xenochimeric animals have detectable serum levels of human IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human IL-6 inhibition with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody <z:mp ids='MP_0002052'>decreased tumor incidence</z:mp> from 62 % to 27 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, anti-IL-6 treatment significantly improved xenotransplanted animal survival, with median survival at &gt; 245 days when compared to that of controls at 132 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, IL-6 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of EBV-induced human lpd, and IL-6 inhibition may represent a new and promising preventive or therapeutic approach against this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
