<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hybrid clones, HYNI-1 and HYNI-2, were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These clones expressed surface IgG and HLA class II antigens derived from PWM-B cells, and they had about 20 more chromosomes than Raji 6-TGR-neoR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More significantly, one clone, HYNI-2, expressed interleukin-2 receptor on the cell surface, and generated IgG when stimulated with recombinant interleukin-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the HYNI-2 is a good model for studying human B cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
