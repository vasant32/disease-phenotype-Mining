<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of CHOP regimen on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The optimal chemotherapy regimen needs to be investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was to evaluate the efficacy of modified B-NHL-BFM-90 protocol on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in children and adolescents, and observe the survival status </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2006, 31 untreated Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients aged less than 20 were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age of these patients was 5 (range, 1.5-20 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 31 patients, 20 (64.5%) were male, 11 (35.5%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to St Jude staging system, 1 (3.2%) was at stage I, 6 (19.4%) at stage II, 8 (25.8%) at stage III, 16 (51.6%) at stage IV; 24 (77.4%) were at stage III/IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>According to clinical stage, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) level and treatment response, these patients were divided into low, moderate and high risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They received modified B-NHL-BFM-90 protocol: cytotoxic drugs such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, ifosfamide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, adriamycin, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, vindesin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, cytarabinec/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and intrathecal injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor lysis syndrome</z:e> during prophase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The efficacy was evaluable in 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of the 30 patients, 25 (83.3%) achieved complete remission (CR), 3 (10.0%) achieved partial remission (PR), 2 (6.7%) had progressive disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>)รป 1 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-4 myelosuppression occurred in most patients and were recovered by active support care and did not affect next course of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 33 months (range, 3-98 months), the 3-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 86.0% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with 100% for stage I/II patients and 82.1% for stage III/IV patients, 100% for low risk group, 92.0% for moderate risk group, and 70.0% for high risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modified B-NHL-BFM-90 protocol can improve the responses and survival of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Chinese children and adolescents, with tolerable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It should be used in the experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center and hematological unit </plain></SENT>
