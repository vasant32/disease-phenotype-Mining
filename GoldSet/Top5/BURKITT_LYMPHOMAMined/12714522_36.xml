<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-NHLs) is associated with chromosomal translocations that deregulate the expression of various oncogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a novel mechanism of genetic lesion, termed aberrant hypermutation, has been identified in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) of immunocompetent hosts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, the somatic hypermutation (SHM) process that normally targets immunoglobulin V (IgV) genes in B cells appears to misfire and causes mutations in the 5' sequences of multiple proto-oncogenes, including PIM-1, PAX-5, RhoH/<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>, and c-MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether aberrant hypermutation occurs also in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-NHL, we studied the mutation profile of these 4 genes in various histologic subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in 1 gene or more were detected in 19 of 39 (48.7%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-NHL cases (10 of 18 AIDS-diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 4 of 11 AIDS-Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 4 of 6 AIDS-primary effusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 1 of 4 AIDS-primary central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), with 9 of 39 (23.1%) cases carrying mutations in 2 or more genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, PIM-1 was mutated in 5 of 39 (12.8%), PAX-5 in 8 of 39 (20.5%), RhoH/<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> in 9 of 39 (23.1%), and c-MYC in 7 of 27 (25.9%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-NHL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations were represented mainly by single base pair substitutions (n = 63) with rare deletions/insertions (n = 5) and displayed features typical of the IgV-associated SHM process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, a number of mutations in PIM-1 and c-MYC were found to affect coding exons, leading to amino acid substitutions with likely functional consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of intraclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> documented that the aberrant hypermutation activity may be ongoing in at least some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that aberrant hypermutation is associated with various subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-NHL and may represent a major contributor to their pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
