<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, four monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) directed to a region (amino acid residues 442-530) of EBNA1 were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments using biotinylated MoAbs showed that they recognized distinct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reactivity of these MoAbs with various laboratory EBV strains and field EBV isolates was shown to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in that EBNA1 from certain strains (isolates) was recognized and that from others was not </plain></SENT>
