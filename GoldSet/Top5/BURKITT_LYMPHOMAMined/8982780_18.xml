<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>IL-12 has been shown to play a central role in cell-mediated inflammatory reactions through direct activation of T cells and NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-12 also strongly influences humoral immunity but these effects have been thought to be indirect and caused by intermediary cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using flow cytometry, we now show that IL-12 directly interacts with B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Freshly isolated murine peritoneal B-1 and conventional B lymphocytes bound IL-12, but splenic B cells failed to react unless first stimulated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> murine B cell sources were found to express IL-12R beta 1 subunit transcripts as detected by PCR and RNase protection assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-12 binding was also detected on phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human T cell blasts and Staphylococcus aureusl IL-2-stimulated B cell blasts but not on freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, IL-12 directly bound to the human SKW6.4 Burkitt's B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases positive staining was ablated by omitting IL-12 from the procedure, showing that it was not due to detection of endogenous IL-12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that B cells represent another major target for IL-12 in addition to T and NK cells, and that IL-12 can directly affect humoral immunity </plain></SENT>
