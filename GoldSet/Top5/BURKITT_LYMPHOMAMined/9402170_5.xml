<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The goals of this study are to describe the frequency, clinical characteristics, and outcome of the different non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> according to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients included in the recently published analysis of the Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Classification Project were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had their slides reviewed and classified by five independent expert hematopathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphomas</z:hpo> were classified according to the Revised European American Classification of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sufficient data were available on 1283 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five age groups were analyzed: &lt; 35 years, 35-49 years, 50-59 years, 60-69 years, and &gt; or = 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Few differences were observed between the age groups with regard to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types and clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were observed more frequently in patients younger than 35 years, whereas small lymphocytic and lymphoplasmacytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were observed more frequently in patients older than 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were observed more frequently in middle-aged patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Poor performance status was more frequent in older patients, as was bone marrow infiltration, whereas spleen involvement was more frequent in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Young and older patients had a slightly worse age-adjusted International Prognostic Index score (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete response rates decreased with age from 68% in the youngest patients to 45% in the oldest patients (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median event-free survival and overall survival also decreased with age (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients have a poorer outcome than younger patients but age alone is not sufficient to discriminate patients with a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, the histologic type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and clinical characteristics may define a subgroup of patients with a poor outcome in each age category </plain></SENT>
