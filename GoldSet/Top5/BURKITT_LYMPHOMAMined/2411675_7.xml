<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have raised a murine IgM monoclonal antibody (MA6) against immunoprecipitate obtained by reacting the serum of an NPC patient with extract of the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It reacts against an antigen (BLCa) which is broadly represented on human B lymphoid tissues and cell lines but is different from the functional B-cell markers such as surface immunoglobulins, Ia products, Fc and complement receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BLCa was found to occur on lymphoid cell lines representing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These included the pre-B and null-cell lines, Nalm 6 and Reh, the EBV-transformed lymphoid cell lines and the <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MA6 was reactive against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, whether or not these harbored the EBV genomes, with the exception of P3HR-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The antibody was found to be selectively reactive against a proportion of peripheral blood B lymphocytes and to stain the B-cell-rich primary follicles and mantle zones of secondary follicles in the lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, MA6 was not reactive against cell lines of T-lymphocyte, myeloid, monocyte fibroblast or epithelial origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It did, nevertheless selectively stain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from a variety of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues originating from different anatomical sites, including the nasopharynx </plain></SENT>
