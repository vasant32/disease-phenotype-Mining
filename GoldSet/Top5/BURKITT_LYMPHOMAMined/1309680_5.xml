<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-4 cell line is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-5 cell line is EBV-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetically, both cell lines had the same chromosomal translocation, t(8;14)(q24;q32) as those observed in the primary malignant cells from individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular studies confirmed that both cell lines were derived from the primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-4 cells lacked CD23(H107), CD11a(LFA-1), and latent membrane protein (LMP) but expressed CD54(ICAM-1) at low levels, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-5 cells showed the high level of expression of CD54 and faint expression of LMP but lacked CD11a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) expressed CD11a, CD23, CD54, and LMP at high levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-5 phenotype with expression of CD54 and LMP tends toward an LCL phenotype, and the augmentation of CD54 on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-5 cells in comparison with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells is likely to be upregulated by LMP, probably resulting from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was little difference in the BrdUrd uptake in vivo and in vitro, doubling time, tumorigenicity, and dynamics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice between both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the potentiality of cell growth and tumorigenicity of these two cell lines are unlikely to be related with EBV </plain></SENT>
