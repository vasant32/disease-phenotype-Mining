<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated that globotriaosyl <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> (Gb3 or CD77) plays a role in alpha-interferon signal transduction and CD19-mediated homotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> in B cell lines derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These roles for Gb3 may involve the proteins IFNAR-1 (subunit 1 of the interferon-alpha receptor) and CD19, respectively, both of which have potential Gb3-binding sites in their extracellular domains which resemble those of the verotoxin (Shiga toxin and Shiga-like toxin) B subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of this work was performed using <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Daudi cells and a single, Gb3-deficient mutant cell line, VT500 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present investigations, these and additional Daudi-derived cells with varying degrees of sensitivity to interferon-alpha were examined for Gb3 expression, interferon-induced growth inhibition and CD19 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of interferon-induced growth inhibition and CD19 expression correlated with Gb3 expression in the various cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, reconstitution of the VT500 cell line with Gb3 but not other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> partially restored the sensitivity of cells to IFN-induced growth inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree to which reconstitution restored sensitivity to growth inhibition was similar to the results of previous studies in which Gb3 reconstitution restored sensitivity to verotoxin-induced cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that Gb3 is specifically required for IFN-induced growth inhibition in Daudi cells and provide further evidence of a role for Gb3 in CD19 expression and function in these cells </plain></SENT>
