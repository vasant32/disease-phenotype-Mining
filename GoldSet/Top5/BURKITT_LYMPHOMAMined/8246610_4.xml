<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Constitutive IL-8 production was found for 14/15 B-cell lines (5 derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons and 2 from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, 1 pre-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, 2 CLL with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12, 2 HTLV-I+, 1 HTLV-II+, 1/2 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), 4/16 T-cell lines (3/6 HTLV-I+, 1 HTLV-II+, 0/9 T-ALL), myeloid line <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60, monocytoid line U937, 3/3 <z:mp ids='MP_0003579'>ovarian carcinoma</z:mp>, 1/1 endometriosis, 2/2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibroblast, 0/2 C-ALL, 0/1 pre-erythroid line K562, as well as for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Later, cells examined by indirect immunofluorescence using IL-8 antibodies gave a positive reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA from 4 IL-8 producing and 3 non-producing cell lines, when probed with IL-8 cDNA gave the same 3.5 kb EcoRI fragment indicating similarities of the IL-8 gene in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two B-cell lines examined showed the expression of 1.8 kb IL-8 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate IL-8 production by a greater variety of cells than previously believed which open possibilities for new IL-8-mediated immune functions by such cells as B-cells </plain></SENT>
