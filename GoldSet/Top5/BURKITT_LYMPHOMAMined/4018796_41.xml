<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Full cytogenetic analysis of 27 different <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gross <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> of chromosome arms 6p and 1q were very common, being observed in 15/27 and 21/27 tumors, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, we found that chromosome 13 was rarely missing: only 3/27 had a detectable <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> affecting 13q14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> of chromosome 13 by small deletion or rearrangement was also not observed in any of 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lines analyzed detail at the 300-400 chromosome band level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A novel observation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> was the discovery of non-random translocations at three specific breakpoints, 14q32 (4/12), 17p12 (5/12), and 10q25 (3/12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genomic rearrangements similar to those described involving C-myc in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 14q+ cells could not be demonstrated in the four 14q+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> lines using molecular techniques, and a probe mapping to the site implicated to have an activating role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that there is a target for rearrangement at 14q32 but it is not the same sequence used in some Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two other breakpoints (2p24 and 8q24) coincided with the mapped position of cellular oncogenes, but also failed to show a molecular rearrangement with the oncogene probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints, 10q25 and 17p12, are constitutional fragile sites which may predispose these regions to act as acceptors of translocations in malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One line had double minute chromosomes, and was the only one of 16 (6%) tested with the N-myc probe which had an amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from single patients with multifocal heritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> showed independent karyotype evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unilateral non-heritable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> exhibited a high level of karyotype stability throughout both in vivo and in vitro growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The various common patterns of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and translocations probably confer an early selective advantage to malignant cells, rather than induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
