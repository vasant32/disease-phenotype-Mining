<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that proliferation of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines such as Ramos is markedly reduced by iron treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that iron induces expression of c-myc which, owing to its transcriptional regulatory functions, regulates genes involved in iron metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient enhancement of c-myc expression by iron could increase the expression of genes involved in iron incorporation, which could lead to an accumulation of intracellular free iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we have investigated whether cells with a high basal level of c-Myc were more likely to accumulate free iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the basal level of c-Myc in Ramos cells is twofold higher than what is seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in Ramos cells, where c-Myc is expressed at a high level, H-ferritin expression is down-regulated, transferrin receptor (CD71) expression is increased, and ferritin translation is inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These modifications in iron metabolism, resulting from the strong basal expression of c-Myc, and amplified by iron addition, could lead to a disruption in homeostasis and consequently to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
