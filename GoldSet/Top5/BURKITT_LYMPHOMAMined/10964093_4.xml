<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutant p53 also generally accumulates in the nucleus of transformed or neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, examples of cytoplasmic accumulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or mutant p53 have also been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various explanations have been provided for defective nuclear localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we propose a novel example of cytoplasmic p53 localization which occurs in cells showing gene amplification and appears to be due to the formation of stable p53 multimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>-resistant Chinese hamster cell line (MTX M) carrying amplified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23743">dihydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase genes and derived from a cell line with p53 nuclear accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MTX M showed cytoplasmic p53 localization and, on immunoblots, several extra bands in the high molecular weight region, besides the expected 53 kDa band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>p53 localization and the appearance of high molecular weight bands appeared to be correlated with the degree of DNA amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, amplification of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23743">dihydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase itself was not involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Changing the p53 phosphorylation status quantitatively influenced the formation of high molecular weight bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cell fusion experiments demonstrated that p53 cytoplasmic localization in MTX M is a dominant phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that the defect causing lack of nuclear localization in this cell line does not reside in the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the cytoplasm of MTX M and of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>/MTX M heterodikaryons p53 gives rise to protein complexes that are unable to re-enter the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The formation of such protein complexes is dependent on the amplification of an unknown gene product </plain></SENT>
