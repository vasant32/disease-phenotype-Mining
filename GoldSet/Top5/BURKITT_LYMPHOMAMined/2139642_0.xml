<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A cell line secreting a human monoclonal antibody was established by Epstein-Barr virus transforming B cells derived from an enlarged cervical lymph node excised from a patient bearing a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_400'>carotid body tumor</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reactivity of the monoclonal antibody, designated as mNISP, was tested on various cells and cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An antigen defined by the mNISP was expressed on some Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and on a non-T non-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this antigen was expressed on leukemic cells from 2 of 8 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 2 of 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, one of 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, and two patients with adult T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, but it was not expressed on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T, B and adherent (macrophage) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, mNISP reacted with T cells obtained from human T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus type I carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that the antigen defined by mNISP was distinct from any previously reported antigen in terms of its pattern of cellular expression and molecular weight, suggesting that mNISP recognizes a new antigen expressed on some lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
