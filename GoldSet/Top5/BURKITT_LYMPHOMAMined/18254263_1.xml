<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in advanced stages of Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (LNH) the secondary invasion of the pancreas is observed more frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>Jaundice</z:hpo> due to extrahepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001396'>cholestasis</z:hpo> as a presentation form is extremely rare, with only few cases described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim is to present a case of an obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> as an expression of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> probably due to a diffuse pancreatic infiltration in an adult without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> with a rapid response of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001396'>cholestasis</z:hpo> to low dose of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037286" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Skin tumor</z:e> simultaneously present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> allowed the histologic diagnosis with skin biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a unique dose of 100 mg <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> improved and cholestatic enzymes decreased, pancreas became smaller and common bile duct diameter became <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at ultrasound and CT scan, also <z:hpo ids='HP_0008069'>skin tumors</z:hpo> turn pale and diminished in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are isolated reports of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases with associated obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> due to pancreatic infiltration or by compression by lymph nodes of the bile ducts, many of them are pediatric cases or immunodepressed HIV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the case presented, surgical resection of the pancreatic infiltration and biliary drainage, either surgical or endoscopic during the same procedure was not necessary for the histopathologic diagnosis of the illness like is described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was suspected by the rapid decrease of cholestatic features after a single dose of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> and the histology was easy done by a skin biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We think the interest in this case is the quick response to low doses of corticoids, which avoided the necessity of surgical procedure for the diagnosis of the biliary tree obstruction, allowing a quick implementation of the specific chemotherapeutic treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> without any surgical or endoscopic procedures to heal the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
