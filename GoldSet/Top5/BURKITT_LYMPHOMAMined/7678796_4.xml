<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A human nonpituitary cell line grown under serum-free (sf) conditions (sfRamos Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line) has been reported to secrete a 29K PRL-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> which acts as an autocrine growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conditioned medium from these cells was examined for lactogenic activity using the Nb2 bioassay and RIAs specific for human GH (hGH) and hPRL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SfRamos conditioned medium stimulated the growth of Nb2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-hGH monoclonal antibodies but not anti-hPRL inhibited the mitogenic effect of sfRamos conditioned medium on Nb2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive hGH but not hPRL was detected by RIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation with anti-hGH polyclonal antibody followed by Western blot analysis with anti-hGH monoclonal antibody revealed a specific 22K band with the same mobility as pituitary hGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis with an hGH complementary DNA (cDNA) probe revealed a 1.0-kilobase transcript migrating coincident with pituitary hGH <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A less abundant, 1.6-kilobase transcript was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using specific primers for the hGH cDNA generated the predicted 248-base pair band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction sequencing of this fragment revealed sequence identity to the hGH-N cDNA, demonstrating conclusively the expression of the hGH-N gene in the sfRamos cell line </plain></SENT>
