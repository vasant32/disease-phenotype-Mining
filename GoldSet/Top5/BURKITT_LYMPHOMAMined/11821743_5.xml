<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Posttransplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> (PTLD), driven by the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), is becoming an increasingly important clinical problem after solid organ transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of immunosuppressive therapy leads to the inhibition of the cytotoxic T cells that normally control the EBV latently infected B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognosis for many patients with PTLD is poor, and the optimal treatment strategy is not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This study investigates the use of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitor, azelaic bishydroxamic acid (ABHA), for its ability to effectively kill EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro treatment of lymphoblastoid cell lines with ABHA showed that they were effectively killed by low doses of the drug (ID50 2-5 microg/ml) within 48 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As well as being effective against polyclonal B-cell lines, ABHA was also shown to be toxic to seven of eight clonal Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, indicating that the drug may also be useful in the treatment of late-occurring clonal PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, ABHA treatment did not induce EBV replication or affect EBV latent gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These studies suggest that ABHA effectively kills both polyclonal and clonal B-cell lines and has potential in the treatment of PTLD </plain></SENT>
