<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional expression of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome has been shown to differ markedly between nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) cells and latent B-cell lines, with a more limited pattern of gene expression seen in NPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBNA-1 is the only nuclear antigen so far detected in both NPC and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found previously that in a human NPC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> passaged in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice, designated C15, the EBNA-1 mRNA contained a novel splice site in the BamHI Q region of EBV which had not previously been described for B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This lies within a region of the EBV genome to which EBNA-1 binds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we further characterize the 5' region of EBNA-1 transcripts and identify two splicing patterns in C15 cells; we show that they are derived from a common promoter region in the BamHI F region of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate that this region can function to initiate transcription of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase gene in epithelial cells and that the promoter region is only partially methylated at CpG sites in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a B-lymphoblastoid cell line derived from C15 uses a conventional promoter in BamHI-C/W for expression of EBNA-1 </plain></SENT>
