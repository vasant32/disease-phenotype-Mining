<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> caused a significant decrease of C3 receptors in the cultures of both Raji and SB4 cells (by approximately 50% of the C3 receptors in untreated cultures at 10 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Kinetic studies revealed that the rate of reduction was rather moderate but progressive, reaching a maximum 5 days after treatment with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kinetic studies showed that EBV receptors also decreased, similar to the reduction seen with C3 receptors after <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> on the reduction of C3 receptors was observed not only in these cells but also in other EBV-positive B-cells, subclones of SB4 cells, and MOLT-4 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in an EBV-negative B-cell line, BJAB, EAC rosette formation was significantly enhanced </plain></SENT>
