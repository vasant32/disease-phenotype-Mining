<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gene mapping studies have shown that c-myc, the cellular homologue of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> myc oncogene, is localized at 8q24 (ref 3-5) and that the three immunoglobulin gene loci map at the breakpoints involved in the translocation: immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes are located at 14q32 (refs 6, 7), kappa light chains at 2p12 (ref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>8) and delta light chains at, or close to, 22q11 (ref 9, 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This correlation suggests an association of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements with the occurrence of these specific translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By using in situ hybridization we have examined the translocation point with respect to c-myc in two cell lines containing 2;8 translocation, and report here that the c-myc gene remains on the chromosome 8 involved in the reciprocal exchange with chromosome 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have also confirmed that the c-myc gene moves from the translocated chromosome 8 in a cell line having a 8;14 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results show that chromosomal breakage can occur on either side of the c-myc gene in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
