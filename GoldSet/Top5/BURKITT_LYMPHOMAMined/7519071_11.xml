<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early treatment of these mice with either an immunotoxin (IT) cocktail (consisting of anti-CD19-ricin A chain plus anti-CD22-ricin A chain) or chemotherapy significantly prolonged survival but was not curative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy with the IT cocktail and any one of three chemotherapeutic drugs (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, cytoxan, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27656">camptothecin</z:chebi>) cured the mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cure was demonstrated by both histopathologic examination of treated mice and, more importantly, by adoptive transfer of cells from organs of the cured mice to naive <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice where 100 tumor cells would have caused disease in the recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results provide a strong rationale for combining IT therapy with conventional chemotherapy in the treatment of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
