<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the identification of two related human genes, BCL7B and BCL7C, which share 90% identity to the amino-terminal 51 amino acids of human BCL7A, as well as 41% identity in the same region to Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Brugia malayi EST sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This degree of relatedness in the amino-terminal domain suggests we have defined a new gene family of unknown function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was little sequence conservation between the family members outside this conserved domain and no identified protein motifs could be deduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human BCL7B and BCL7C mapped to chromosome 7q11.23, and 16p11, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No chromosomal rearrangements affecting BCL7B or BCL7C were detected in lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BCL7B did, however, map within the region of 7q11.23 which is commonly deleted in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disorder</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175702" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Williams syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
