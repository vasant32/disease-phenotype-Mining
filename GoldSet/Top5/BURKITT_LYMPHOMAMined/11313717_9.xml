<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Divalent cations, including Zinc and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">Manganese</z:chebi> ions, are important modulators of cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the ability of these two divalent cations to modulate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cells line (Ramos) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that Zinc (from 10 to 50 microM) inhibited <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">Manganese</z:chebi>-induced caspase-3 activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Higher concentration of Zinc (50 to 100 microM) did not prevent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">Manganese</z:chebi>-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> but rather increased cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This Zinc-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was associated with apoptotic features such as cell shrinkage, the presence of phosphatidylserine residues on the outer leaflet of the cells, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and decrease of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transmembrane potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Zinc-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was associated with caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation as revealed by the appearance of active p35 fragment of caspase-9 and p19 and p17 of caspase-3 as well as in vivo cleavage of PARP and of a cell-permeable fluorogenic caspase-3 substrate (Phiphilux-G(1)D(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both Zinc-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and caspase-3 activation were prevented by the cell-permeable, broad-spectrum inhibitor of caspases (zVAD-fmk) or overexpression of bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we show that Zinc-induced loss of transmembrane <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> potential is a caspase-independent event, since it is not modified by the presence of zVAD-fmk, which is inhibited by overexpression of bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that depending on its concentration, Zinc can exert opposite effects on caspase-3 activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in human B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells: concentrations below 50 microM inhibit caspase-3 activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> whereas higher concentrations of Zinc activate a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathway associated with apoptotic-like features and caspase-3 activation </plain></SENT>
