<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that TIMP1 down-regulates B-cell receptor and BCL6, and activates interleukins-6,-10 (ILs)/signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) signaling in GC B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activation of ILs/STAT3 signaling can amplify CD44 function, and vice versa, and induce protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 activity by a negative feedback mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that TIMP1 up-regulates cell surface CD44 (standard and variants 3 and 7-10) and induces the activity and nuclear localization of SHP1 in an Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, the neoplastic counterpart of GC centroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that TIMP1 functions as a differentiating and survival factor of GC B cells by modulating CD44 and SHP1 in the late centrocyte/post-GC stage, regardless of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
