<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was to investigate the serum level of VEGF in children and adolescent patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The serum levels of VEGF(sVEGF) in 24 pretreated NHL patients were detected by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>sVEGF in 10 of the 24 patients who received complete response after treatment were also detected by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average serum VEGF level was 745.79 ng/L (40.64-3623.09 ng/L)in 24 NHL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> [(294.20+/-23.40) ng/L] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>sVEGF in 18 of the patients were higher than the standard, while in 6 of the patients were lower than the standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average serum VEGF level was 289.54 ng/L (35.11-826.8 ng/L) in 10 of The CR patients, 8 cases of them had a high VEGF level before treatment but a nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level after first CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>And 2 cases of them had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level during the course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The serum level of VEGF in NHL patients was higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The high serum level of VEGF has a tendency to drop to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> standard after receiving CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From the clinical data, a high serum level was not found associated with stage, gender, PS. score, IPI score, serum LDH and "B" symptoms et al </plain></SENT>
