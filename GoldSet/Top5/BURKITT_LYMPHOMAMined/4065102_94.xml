<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We find that c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is present, at equivalent levels, at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times in the cell cycle with the possible exception of mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that this <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is transcribed in both G1 and G2 phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An analysis of the c-myc protein in vivo shows that de novo synthesis occurs in G1 and G2 and the protein turns over with a half-life of approximately 20-30 min in both phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the level of c-myc protein rapidly increases in cell populations when they re-initiate the cell cycle, thereafter decreasing as the culture reaches quiescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results therefore suggest that expression of c-myc can be rapidly modulated and that it is activated during the G0 to G1 transition, but is expressed thereafter in the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
