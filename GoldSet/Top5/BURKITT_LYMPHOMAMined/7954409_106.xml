<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study assessed the role of the p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene in cell cycle arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> following treatment of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphoblastoid cell lines with gamma-rays, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle arrest was measured by flow cytometry; p53 and p21Waf1/Cip1 protein levels were measured by Western blotting; cell survival was measured in 72-96-h growth inhibition assays and by trypan blue staining, and apoptotic DNA fragmentation was assessed by either <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis or a modified filter elution method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that gamma-rays and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> induced a strong G1 arrest in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 lines while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> induced relatively little G1 arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> agents failed to induce G1 arrest in cells containing mutant p53 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of G1 arrest observed with these agents correlated with the rate of p53 and p21Waf1/Cip1 protein accumulation: gamma-rays and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> induced rapid accumulation of both p53 and p21Waf1/Cip1; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> induced slow accumulation of p53 and no major accumulation of the p21Waf1/Cip1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite differences in G1 arrest and kinetics of p53 or p21Waf1/Cip1 protein accumulation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> agents tended to decrease survival to a greater extent in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 lines compared to the mutant p53 lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 lines was associated with intracellular DNA degradation into oligonucleosomal sized DNA fragments, indicative of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also observed an inverse sensitivity relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> in the mutant p53 lines and this was found to correlate with topoisomerase II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that p53 gene status is an important determinant of both radio- and chemosensitivity in lymphoid cell lines and that p53 mutations are often associated with decreased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents </plain></SENT>
