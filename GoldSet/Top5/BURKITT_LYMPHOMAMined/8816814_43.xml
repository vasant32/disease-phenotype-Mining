<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) and latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) are essential for transformation of primary human B cells by EBV in vitro; however, these genes are not expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address the question whether c-myc activation might abrogate the requirement of the EBNA2 and LMP1 function, we have introduced an activated c-myc gene into an EBV-transformed cell line in which EBNA2 was rendered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-dependent through fusion with the hormone binding domain of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The c-myc gene was placed under the control of regulatory elements of the immunoglobulin kappa locus composed a matrix attachment region, the intron enhancer, and the 3' enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show here that transfection of a c-myc expression plasmid followed by selection for high MYC expression is capable of inducing continuous proliferation of these cells in the absence of functional EBNA2 and LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>c-myc-induced hormone-independent proliferation was associated with a dramatic change in the growth behavior as well as cell surface marker expression of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The typical lymphoblastoid <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and phenotype of EBV-transformed cells completely changed into that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells reflects the expression pattern of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and cellular genes rather than its germinal center origin </plain></SENT>
