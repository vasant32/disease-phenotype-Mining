<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Burkitt cells were strongly positive with the full panel of monospecific antisera against human immunoglobulin components (kappa and lambda light chains, gamma, alpha and micron heavy chains) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 'starry-sky' macrophages were weakly positive with antimuramidase antiserum and strongly positive with the antisera against immunoglobulins, thus demonstrating their phagocytic and histiocytic nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reasons for the polyclonal increase in immunoglobulins are discussed </plain></SENT>
