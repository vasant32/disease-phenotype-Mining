<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>LL2, an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody against B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, was covalently linked to the amphibian ribonuclease, onconase, a member of the pancreatic RNase A superfamily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LL2 increased in vitro potency (10 000-fold) and specificity against human Daudi Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells while decreasing systemic toxicity of onconase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monensin further increased potency of LL2-onconase on Daudi cells (IC(50), 20 and 1.5 pM, absence and presence of monensin, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 1-hour exposure to LL2-onconase was sufficient to kill Daudi cells in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These favorable in vitro properties translated to significant antitumor activity against disseminated Daudi <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In mice inoculated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells intraperitoneally (ip), LL2-onconase (100 microg 5 times ip every day) increased the life span of animals with minimal disease 200% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The life span of mice with advanced disseminated Daudi <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells inoculated intravenously) was increased 135% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mice injected with LL2-onconase tolerated a dose as high as 300 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because both onconase and LL2 are in clinical trials as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapeutics, the covalently linked agents should be considered for treatment of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
