<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specifically, effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis-retinoic acid</z:chebi> and 13-trans-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> on the growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow cells in soft-agar system were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both short-term incubation and continuous exposure to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> caused a decreased number of granulocyte colonies and an increased cluster-to-colony ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect was concentration-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examination of specimens stained with Wright-Giemsa or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitro blue tetrazolium</z:chebi> stains showed a progressive increase in the percentage of immature granulocytic precursors with increasing concentrations of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No effect of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> was seen on a number of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">Retinoic acid</z:chebi> blocked both differentiation and proliferation and appeared to do so by specific, noncytotoxic mechanisms in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
