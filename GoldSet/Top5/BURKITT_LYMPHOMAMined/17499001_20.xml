<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have compared the growth inhibitory and apoptogenic potential of the pan-HDACi SAHA and the sub-class I selective HDAC inhibitor MS275, as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> (VPA) on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> sensitive and resistant B (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) and T (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>) cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> cells and patients blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, to our previous results with U937 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) cells which showed a similar activity of MS275 and SAHA in growth inhibition and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction, both B and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> cells were much more efficiently killed by SAHA and VPA than by MS275 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same relative potency was observed with some patient ALL blasts treated ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SAHA displayed similar efficacy on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>-sensitive and insensitive ALL cells but did not synergize with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In studying mediators of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> we found that the TRAIL receptor DR5 is constitutively expressed in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>-sensitive CEM-C7 cells which are also TRAIL sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>-insensitive CEM-C1 cells do not express DR5 and are insensitive to TRAIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, SAHA induces, in addition to p21(WAF1/CIP1) also re-expression of DR5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, SAHA-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CEM-C7 cells operates through initiator caspase 10, while it induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CEM-C1 cells through the intrinsic, as well as through caspase-independent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the generation of resistance to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> has dramatically altered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> signaling in these cells and that SAHA overcomes these restrictions by inducing alternative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathways </plain></SENT>
