<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitates from [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]methionine, pulse-chase labeled leukemic cells, B-lymphoblastoid cells, and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were examined after 2-dimensional, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The class II MHC-associated Ii chain was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell types, but the Ii-derived p25 protein was not found in HCL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ip, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi>-derivatized form of Ii, was well expressed in BLCL and Raji cells, but weakly in HCL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>P70 was strongly expressed in BLCL and Raji cells, but negligibly in HCL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These alterations might reflect deficient mechanisms for antigen processing and presentation by these leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
