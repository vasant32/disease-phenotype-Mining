<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We generated a fusion protein of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase and zinc finger domain of BCL6 to determine recognition sequences of BCL6 with polymerase chain reaction using random oligonucleotides of 26 bases as a ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A consensus of 14 nucleotides consisting of (T/A)NCTTTCNAGG(A/G)AT was identified in the recognition sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a gel mobility shift assay, the probe containing the 14-nucleotide recognition sequence formed a complex with the fusion protein and nuclear proteins from Burkitt's cell lines overexpressing the BCL6 transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The consensus sequence was protected from the digestion by nuclease in a DNase I footprinting assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, BCL6 may be involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> by binding to the consensus sequences of the other genes </plain></SENT>
