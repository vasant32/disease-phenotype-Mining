<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two clones of cells containing both plasmids were analyzed for the number of copies of each plasmid when the cells were propagated in the absence or in the presence of one or both selective agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> conditions tested, the plasmid with two copies of oriP behaved in cells as did the plasmid with one copy of this plasmid origin of replication </plain></SENT>
