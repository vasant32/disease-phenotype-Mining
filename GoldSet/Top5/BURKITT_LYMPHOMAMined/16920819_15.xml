<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, an alternative EBNA promoter, Cp, becomes dominant, Wp activity declines dramatically, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) shows extensive Wp methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite this, Wp is never completely silenced in LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, using a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing and methylation-specific PCR, we show that in standard LCLs transformed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> EBV isolates, some Wp copies always remain unmethylated, and in LCLs transformed with a recombinant EBV carrying just two BamHI W copies, Wp is completely unmethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have analyzed rare LCLs, recently established using <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> EBV isolates, and rare Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell clones, recently established from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> carrying EBNA2-deleted EBV genomes, which express EBNAs exclusively from Wp-initiated transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, in sharp contrast to standard LCL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resident copies of Wp appear to be predominantly hypomethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, studies of B cells with atypical patterns of Wp usage emphasize the strong correlation between the presence of unmethylated Wp sequences and promoter activity </plain></SENT>
