<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The maximum activity of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) induced with 2-ME was observed on day 4 of culture and the induction of CMC was completely inhibited by the addition of inhibitor of DNA synthesis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cytosin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CMC induced with 2-ME was specifically inhibited by the addition of unlabeled target cells to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-release assay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that killer T cells were generated in the presence of 2-ME as a result of nonspecific polyclonal activation of precursors into cytotoxic effector cells and that they recognized target cells with antigen-specific recognition receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spleen cells deprived of adherent cells showed impaired induction of CMC with 2-ME </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The addition of peritoneal exudate macrophages to splenic T cells restored this response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The result indicated that macrophages were essential for the induction of CMC with 2-ME </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possibility that the function of macrophages was mediated by soluble factor(s) released from macrophages was demonstrated by the separate culture of splenic T cells and macrophages in double-chambered, Marbrook-type vessels and by the addition of supernatants from macrophage cultures to splenic T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2-ME and soluble factor(s) released from macrophages seemed to be required for the activation of precursors into killer cells </plain></SENT>
