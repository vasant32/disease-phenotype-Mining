<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>HB4C5 is a human antibody producing plasma B cell line that expresses the recombination activating gene-1 (RAG-1) and RAG-2 constitutively, but undergoes few secondary immunoglobulin gene rearrangements when cultured in fetal bovine serum-containing medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we found that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of serum from the culture media induces secondary VlambdaJlambda rearrangement in this cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the induction mechanism of secondary VlambdaJlambda rearrangement, we assessed the expression levels of RAG-1 and RAG-2 products, Vlambda germline transcription level and the amount of Vlambda signal broken ends (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SBE</z:e>) in HB4C5 cells cultured in serum-supplemented or serum-free medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western-blot analysis showed that the expression level for the RAG-1 and RAG-2 proteins was not affected by the serum <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vlambda germline transcript was found to be constitutively expressed in HB4C5 cell line and this transcription level was not affected by the lack of serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the amount of Vlambda <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SBE</z:e> was shown to be increased in HB4C5 cells cultured in serum-free medium, suggesting that this increased formation of Vlambda <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SBE</z:e> at least partly contributed to the enhanced occurrence of secondary VlambdaJlambda rearrangement in HB4C5 cells cultured in the serum-free condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that expression of RAG proteins and Vlambda germline transcription is not enough to undergo secondary VlambdaJlambda rearrangement in this cell line </plain></SENT>
