<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The reassociation rates of repair replicated DNA of two human lymphoblastoid cell lines, the WIL2-A3 '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>' line and the RAJI line of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, were examined using the DNA/DNA 'Cot' hybridization technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25255">methyl methanesulfonate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi>), an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagen</z:chebi>, to induce the repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incorporated repair replication radioactivity in highly repetitive sequences of WIL2-A3 cell DNA reassociates as expected for a randomly distributed incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reassociation of repair radioactivity in sequences of fewer numbers of copies, however, is less than expected for a random distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is less than that occurring for semiconservatively synthesized DNA of WIL2-A3 cells co-incubated with the repair labeled DNA as an internal control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observed difference could be due to an over-representation of repair replication radioactivity in DNA sequences with fewer copies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is unlikely to be due to residual alkali labile damage resulting from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> treatment, since a similar difference was not observed when semiconservatively labeled DNA from cells which had been treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> for the same time and at the same concentration as in the repair experiments was substituted for repair replicated DNA in the reassociation reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other possible causes of the apparent differences in the reassociation rates observed are discussed </plain></SENT>
