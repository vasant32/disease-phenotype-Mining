<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Random sequencing of clones from a lambda gt10 cDNA library, made from <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressed in an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) has revealed the gene transcript of human CD24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CD24 antigen, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi>-anchored cell surface molecule, has been identified as a B-cell marker that is lost during cell maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show here that it is expressed on 3 NPC xenografts, previously defined as consisting of poorly differentiated epithelial cells, and on an NPC biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the case of the former, the level of expression of CD24 corresponds to the EBV load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A B-lymphoblastoid cell line carrying the same EBV genome as one of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, C15, and an EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line do not display the antigen, but epithelial-like cells of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023055" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">laryngeal tumour</z:e> cell line (Hep2) do express it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that CD24 may be a marker of cell differentiation not only for B cells but also for epithelial cells and may have an indirect association with EBV gene expression </plain></SENT>
