<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BAT manifests anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> properties in mice bearing a variety of murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BAT also induced regression of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> inoculated into <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice that had been engrafted with human lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity of BAT was related to its immune stimulatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previous data indicated that T lymphocytes and NK cells mediate in vivo the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to define the primary target cell for BAT stimulatory activity, the in vitro stimulatory effect of BAT on purified lymphocyte subpopulations was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human CD4(+), CD8(+) T cells and CD56(+) NK cells were purified and their in vitro response to BAT was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that BAT selectively stimulated CD4(+) cells as assessed by proliferation and secretion of IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FACS analysis has also revealed a selective increase in BAT antigen on CD4(+) T cells that were cultured with BAT antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effector cells that mediate BAT-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> eradication may, however, be distinct from those that serve as the primary cellular target of the antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cytokines such as IFN-gamma that are produced by CD4(+) cells may be involved in activation of additional cell types that may be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> destruction </plain></SENT>
