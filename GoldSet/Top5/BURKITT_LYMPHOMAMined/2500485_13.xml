<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, V mutation has been established as a major mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> escape from anti-Id immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We cloned and sequenced the expressed Ig H and L chain V regions from a case of B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> in order to evaluate B cell stages associated with V region mutation, and to determine which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> would be better suited to Id directed immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A consensus VH and V lambda sequence representing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> at diagnosis was obtained by conventional cDNA cloning in lambda gt10 from a heterohybridoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primers which flanked both V regions were used in a modified polymerase chain reaction to generate multiple independent sequences from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells harvested at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to exclude mutations due to infidelity of the amplification procedure, single cDNA templates of known sequence were also amplified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The polymerase chain reaction proved to be an effective procedure to obtain multiple clones, but replication in M13 was associated with a low rate of base misincorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that there is no evidence for biologically significant ongoing mutation in this t(8;14) B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> when comparing sequences at diagnosis and relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, V <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> may be restricted to a discrete B cell stage whose malignant counterpart is follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
