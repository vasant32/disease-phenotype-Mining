<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although many recombinant adenovirus vectors (rAd) have been developed, especially by using group C adenoviruses, to transfer and express genes, such rAd do not readily infect B-cell lines due to the lack of the coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bispecific antibodies have been used in different cell systems to facilitate entry of rAd into otherwise nonpermissive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bispecific antibody is synthesized by covalently linking two monoclonal antibodies with distinct specificities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that lymphoproliferative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> commonly express the cell surface protein CD70, while this receptor is normally expressed on only a small subset of highly activated B cells and T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated whether a bispecific antibody with specificities for the adenovirus fiber protein and CD70 can facilitate rAd entry and subsequent expression of rAd-encoded genes in CD70-positive B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found high CD70 expression on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), as well as some, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We show here that rAd encoding green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) infects EBV-transformed LCLs and a CD70-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line 10- to 20-fold more efficiently in the presence of the CD70-fiber bispecific antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the bispecific antibody does not enhance Ad-GFP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in CD70-deficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using the CD70-fiber bispecific antibody, we increased the ability of rAd vectors encoding the EBV immediate-early proteins BZLF1 and BRLF1 to induce the lytic form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the CD70-fiber bispecific antibody can enhance rAd <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of CD70-positive B cells and suggest the use of this vector to explore EBV-positive LCLs </plain></SENT>
