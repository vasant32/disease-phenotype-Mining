<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The germinal center plays an important role in the pathogenesis of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and evidence exists to suggest that most cases are germinal center or postgerminal center derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are derived from the germinal center stage of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a germinal center-type pattern of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression or a germinal center <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> using immunocytochemistry have a more favorable outcome compared with those with a postgerminal center/activated profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microarray technology may not be available in many diagnostic laboratories, and antibody-based methods are much simpler and cheaper and are therefore more applicable to the routine setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry has the advantage that the cells of interest are identified morphologically, and it is applicable retrospectively to fixed tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main disadvantage is that only single-color staining is currently used in the routine setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry allows one to obtain a more precise definition of individual cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cells of interest are identified by a combination of physical characteristics and by the use of multiple antibodies labeled with different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51217">fluorochromes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry has the major advantage of being able to analyze very large numbers of cells, and results can be obtained within a few hours of the specimen being taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The methods described allow B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> to be crudely divided into two groups, those with a germinal center phenotype and those that are mainly postgerminal center <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As knowledge of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> biology of the germinal center develops, it will become possible to use immunophenotypic methods to more precisely classify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of mature B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
