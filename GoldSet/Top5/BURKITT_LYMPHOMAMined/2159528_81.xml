<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, I show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of primary human B cells with EBV increased the transcript level of the proto-oncogene, c-fgr, 10-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This effect on the level of c-fgr transcripts in B cells was not secondary to blast formation, because levels of c-fgr <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> were also increased 10-fold in two proliferating EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines, Ramos and BJAB, 2 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two lines of evidence indicated that EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) mediates this increase in c-fgr <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> levels: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of BJAB and Ramos cells by a mutant strain of EBV that lacked the EBNA-2 open reading frame, P3HR1, did not affect c-fgr <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> levels; and cell lines constitutively expressing only the EBNA-2 gene of EBV had increased levels of c-fgr <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> relative to those in the parental cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since P3HR1, a nonimmortalizing strain of EBV, failed to affect c-fgr <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> levels and since a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene required for B-cell immortalization was responsible for the induction of c-fgr, the data indicate a possible role of c-fgr expression in B-lymphocyte immortalization by EBV and a mechanism by which EBNA-2 contributes to the immortalizing activity of EBV </plain></SENT>
