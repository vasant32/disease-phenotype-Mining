<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This event is preceded by a decrease of c-myc expression and of the phosphorylation of cellular proteins, due to either a decrease of tyrosine protein kinase activity or an increase of tyrosine phosphatase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These three events form a sequence and are part of the genetic program for differentiation and growth though they may not be causally related </plain></SENT>
