<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of interferon (IFN) on the expression of the nuclear antigen Ki-67 were studied in the two IFN-sensitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell lines Daudi and 251 MG, known to be arrested in the cell cycle in separate stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>/G1-arrested Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Daudi displayed an increasing fraction of Ki-67 negative cells with time, concomitant with an increasing proportion of growth arrested cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A small fraction of Ki-67 positive cells were found mainly arrested in G2/M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no effect on Ki-67 expression was seen in IFN-resistant Namalwa cells, nor in the sensitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cell line 251 MG, which is blocked in the S phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Agents blocking the cells in other phases of the cycle did not affect Ki-67 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, after serum deprivation, no Ki-67 expression was found in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cell line, while restimulation initiated expression after 12 hours as cells entered the S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the Ki-67 antigen was not down regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells inhibited by IFN and thus does not seem to be useful to monitor clinical effects of IFN treatment </plain></SENT>
