<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have cloned and characterized a c-myc (now designated MYC) oncogene that had been translocated into the mu switch region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint of the translocation occurs within the first intron of the c-myc gene, thereby separating the untranslocated first exon from the two coding exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcription from the translocated gene arises from a cryptic promoter within the first intron, which produces a 438-nucleotide untranslated 5' region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the c-myc gene has been substantially altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, a compensating set of frameshift mutations alters a string of 24 amino acids in a region of the protein tightly conserved in human, mouse, and chicken c-myc genes as well as in the human N-myc and L-myc oncogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite this, the mutated gene retains a reduced transforming ability in a rat embryo fibroblast focus-formation assay </plain></SENT>
