<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>XLP patient displays EBV associated fulminant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> or hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> or malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the clinical features, gene mutation and SAP expression on PBMCs of a Chinese patient with XLP and potential carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A 6 years old male patient and his maternal relatives were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was found to have with a renal Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> on the right waist at 5 years of age by accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His elder brother and a maternally related cousin both died of multiple systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342953" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">organ dysfunction syndrome</z:e> (MODS) due to fulminant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (FIM) at the age of one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient and his maternal relatives were subjected to detection of SAP expression on the PBMCs by flow cytometry and gene mutation analysis of SH2D1A by using PCR based on genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The patient exhibited 536.9 copy/ml level of circulating EBV-DNA during remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis showed that the patient harbored a nonsense mutation in exon 2 (C462T), resulting in a premature stop codon (Arg55X) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>His mother and some of the maternal relatives were proved to be carriers of this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SAP expression from the patient was significantly reduced as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individual and the carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We identified a Chinese XLP case genetically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Assessment of SAP expression on PBMCs by flow cytometry seemed to be an effective rapid diagnostic method for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> does not diminish the possibility of XLP </plain></SENT>
