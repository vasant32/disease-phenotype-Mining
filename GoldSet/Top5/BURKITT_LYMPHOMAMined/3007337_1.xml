<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-GP70 antibodies at a high titer were obtained and used for screening of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells of various origin by the indirect immunofluorescence test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, 66% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-cell lines tested were positive to GP70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lymphoblastoid cell lines tested were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> peripheral blood cells and mononuclear cells from tonsils were negative, indicating specificity of antibodies to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison between positively stained <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-cell lines indicated no correlation between the presence of GP70 and EBNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive stain (1-5%) obtained with bone marrow cells might indicate that anti-GP70 antibodies are directed against a surface membrane differentiation <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
