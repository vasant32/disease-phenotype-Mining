<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Robust engraftment of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848852,C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancy</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHM</z:e>) lines and patient cells into the naturally immunodeficient turkey embryo has recently been demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here that fluorescence imaging is a rapid and simple technique for detecting engraftment and homing of cells derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHM</z:e> in turkey embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Raji <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells expressing a far-red fluorescent protein were injected intravascularly into turkey embryos and fluorescence was detected 8 days later in their limbs and skulls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Much stronger signals were obtained after removal of the bones from the limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlabeled Raji cells did not give a fluorescent signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> dramatically reduced the fluorescent signal </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Homing was active, although some non-specific fluorescence was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of fluorescence imaging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHM</z:e> in turkey embryos is therefore feasible and reduces the time, effort and expense for detecting engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This technique has potential to become a high-throughput xenograft system for hematological chemotherapy development and testing, and for study of hematological cell homing </plain></SENT>
