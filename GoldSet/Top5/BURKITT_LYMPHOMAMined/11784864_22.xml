<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>E2A encodes two products, E12 and E47, that are part of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors and are central in B lineage differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>E2A haplo-insufficiency hinders progression through three major checkpoints in B-cell development: commitment into the B lineage, at the pro-B to pre-B transition, and in the induction of immunoglobulin M (IgM) expression required for a functional BCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations underscore the importance of E2A gene dosage in B-cell development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show that a higher proportion of pro-B cells in E2A(+/-) mice is in the cell cycle compared to that in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This increase correlates with lower p21(waf/cip1) levels, indicating that E2A has an antiproliferative function in B-cell progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression in the B lineage of SCL/Tal1, a tissue-specific bHLH factor that inhibits E2A function, blocks commitment into the B lineage without affecting progression through later stages of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ectopic SCL expression exacerbates E2A haplo-insufficiency in B-cell differentiation, indicating that SCL genetically interacts with E2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these observations provide evidence for a gradient of E2A activity that increases from the pre-pro-B to the pre-B stage and suggest a model in which low levels of E2A (as in pro-B cells) are sufficient to control cell growth, while high levels (in pre-B cells) are required for cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The antiproliferative function of E2A further suggests that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> associated with t(1;19) and t(17;19), the disruption of one E2A allele contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e>, in addition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158795" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">other anomalies</z:e> induced by E2A fusion proteins </plain></SENT>
