<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Myc-driven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> often display resistance to chemotherapeutics because of acquisition of mutations that impair the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway regulated by the Bcl-2 protein family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given the need to identify new therapies for such <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, we have evaluated the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-737, a small molecule that mimics the action of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30153">BH3</z:chebi>-only proteins, natural <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> of the prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-737 selectively targets certain prosurvival proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and Bcl-w) but not others (Mcl-1 and A1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We treated mice transplanted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> derived either from Emu-myc transgenic mice or Emu-myc mice that also expressed an Emu-bcl-2 transgene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a single agent, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-737 significantly prolonged the survival of mice transplanted with the myc/bcl-2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> but was ineffective for the myc <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, probably because of the relatively higher Mcl-1 levels found in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, when combined with low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-737 produced sustained disease-free survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals transplanted with two of three myc/bcl-2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination therapy was also more effective against some myc <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> than treatment with either agent alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that antagonism of Bcl-2 with small organic compounds is an attractive approach to enhance the efficacy of conventional therapy for the treatment of Myc-driven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that over-express this prosurvival molecule </plain></SENT>
