<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Members of the TNF-R family are instrumental in controlling lymphoid cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A major role in the regulation of murine and human B cell survival and differentiation has been attributed to CD40/CD40-ligand (CD40-L) interactions, but recent in vitro and in vivo data implicate that other receptor-ligand pairs might also be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have used the human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Ramos as a model system to identify additional TNF-R/TNF family members that are implicated in the regulation of B cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ligation of B cell receptor (BCR) with anti-IgM mAb for 48 h induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in approximately 68% of the Ramos B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, not only CD40 mAb but also rTNF-alpha could efficiently inhibit BCR-induced B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, activated T cells also prevented BCR-triggered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and this effect was inhibited completely by a combination of blocking Abs against CD40-L and TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the strong effect of BCR ligation, <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 mAb induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in only +/- 18% of the Ramos cells after 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Noticeably, addition of CD40 mAb or rTNF-alpha increased the percentage of cells (+/- 46%) undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which correlated with an increase of Fas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 membrane expression induced by CD40 or TNF-R ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we show that CD40/CD40-L and TNF-R/TNF-alpha interactions not only postpone or prevent B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, but are also involved in sensitizing B cells for Fas-ligand (Fas-L)-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
