<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Conventional cytogenetics (CC) was carried out to detect the karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, three color interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to detect the t(8;14)(q24;q32) in 17 newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities was 41.2% (7/17) by CC technique, including one of each for simple t(8;14)(q24;q32), complex chromosomal abnormality containing t(8;14)(q24;q32), t(8;22)(q24;q11), the complex chromosomal abnormality of t(12;22)(?;?), t(2;13)(?;?) with + 12, and one with two marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH method detected eight cases of t(8;14)(q24;q32), including the two detected by CC technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five samples (5/8) showed 2A1G1O2F (two blue, one green, one orange and two yellow signals in interphase nuclei), while three samples (3/8) showed 2A1G1O1F(two blue, one green, one orange and one yellow signals in interphase nuclei) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Two different breakpoints have been identified on the c-Myc locus on 8q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interphase FISH was more sensitive in detecting t(8;14)(q24;q32), and it is an important complement to CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It should be used as a routine method for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
