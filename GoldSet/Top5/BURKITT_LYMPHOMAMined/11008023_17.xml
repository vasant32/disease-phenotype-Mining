<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Second allogeneic stem cell transplants for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> are associated with a high incidence of transplant-related mortality due to the cumulative incidence of toxicity of the high-dose chemoradiotherapy traditionally used as an essential component of the conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated previously that nonmyeloablative conditioning for primary allogeneic transplants from both sibling and unrelated donors results in minimal transplant-related toxicity and excellent stem cell engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study explores the possibility of using nonmyeloablative conditioning to minimize transplant-related toxicity in patients who have undergone second allogeneic transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve high-risk, heavily treated patients-five with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>); five with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL); one with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL)-underwent second allogeneic nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors, 29 (median) (range 3-57) months following their first transplantation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The conditioning consisted of fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) daily for 6 days, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> 4 mg/kg daily for 2 days, and anti-T-lymphocyte globulin 10 mg/kg daily for 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> (anti-GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A alone, 3 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Engraftment was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recipients, with complete and stable chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">veno-occlusive disease of the liver</z:e> or multi-organ failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five very high-risk patients with NHL (n = 3), Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 1) relapsed 2 to 6 months post-transplant, and four of them died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients appear to be disease-free after median follow-up of 23 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One additional patient died from grade IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085692" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhagic cystitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival and disease-free survival at 34 months are 56% and 50% respectively, with 95% confidence interval (25-78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that nonmyeloablative conditioning significantly reduces transplant-related toxicity, thus making a second transplant feasible </plain></SENT>
