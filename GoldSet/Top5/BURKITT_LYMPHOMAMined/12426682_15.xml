<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Between 1991 and 1997, limited funding at times restricted available treatment for children with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CPM) monotherapy at Lilongwe Central Hospital, Malawi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to assess long-term survival in Malawian children with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) who had received one or more treatments with intravenous CPM at 40 mg/kg/dose at 14-day intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE AND RESULTS: The study population consisted of 92 children in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> had been confirmed on fine needle aspirates (FNA), a home address had been documented on discharge from hospital, and the treatment records could be verified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only the clinical site(s) of disease had been recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The M:F ratio was 1.4 and median age 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A clinical officer on motorcycle attempted to locate the given addresses and interview parents or other sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 19 patients, the address was incorrect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 73 evaluable patients, 40 children are alive at a mean follow-up time of 59 (range: 29-104) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The survival rate was 63.5% in 52 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> of the head only, and 33.3% in 21 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> involving the abdomen or other sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survivors had received a median number of 6 (range: 1-12), non-survivors 4 (range: 1-12), and untracable children 3 (range: 1-11) courses of CPM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that CPM could cure children with facial and abdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The unavoidable bias in the selection of patients and the variable amount of CPM given, precludes accurate survival estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A prospective study with proper staging, assessment of FNA, marrow and cerebrospinal fluid with modern techniques, a standard treatment protocol, and adequate follow-up will better define the current therapeutic value of CPM monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CPM can be purchased at about 3 US dollars per 500 mg </plain></SENT>
