<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Gp350, a late Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> expressed on both the envelope of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> particles and EBV-producing cells, is also the candidate for the development of an anti-EBV subunit vaccine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> is thought to play an important role in anti-EBV immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, studies on the role of this <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigen in cellular cytotoxicity and other immune functions have been hampered by the lack of a suitable model expressing gp350 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe here a study in which we successfully transfected a gp350-negative cell line resistant to natural-killer(NK)-cell activity (i.e., Raji) with a recombinant plasmid (pZIP-MA) containing the EBV-gp350 and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi> resistance gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three clones with a stable and strong expression of gp350 on their surface membrane, as demonstrated using a gp350-specific (i.e., 2LI0) monoclonal antibody (MAb) were isolated, characterized and used as targets in an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, gp350 expression on 2 of the 3 isolated clones was not recognized by an anti-gp350 MAb (72AI) which is specific to a unique gp350 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> with a dual function (i.e., involved in both EBV binding to its target cell receptors and in inducing virus-neutralizing antibody) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have also found that gp350 expression on our 3 selected clones does not affect EBV-receptor (CR2) density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our model of gp350-expressing, NK-cell-activity-resistant targets revealed very useful in determining that gp350 serves as a target antigen for EBV-specific ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These gp350-expressing cell clones appear to represent a valuable tool for diagnostic purposes (i.e., for detecting and titrating gp350 antibodies in patients with EBV-associated diseases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our approach should also prove useful for studying the expression of other cell-surface-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> antigens and their role in specific cellular immunity and immunosurveillance </plain></SENT>
