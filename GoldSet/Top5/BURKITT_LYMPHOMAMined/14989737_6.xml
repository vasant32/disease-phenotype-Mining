<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common subtypes are lymphoblastic, Burkitt's and anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent data indicate that a higher risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is associated in children of certain ethnic origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difference is probably related to the underlying etiological factors of these diseases, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a strong candidate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study aims to determine the disease pattern of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the University Hospital Kuala Lumpur, for a direct comparison to the reported data of adults from the same medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 69 and 34 childhood NHL and Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, respectively, were retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common subtypes were lymphoblastic (23 cases), Burkitt's (25 cases) and anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (9 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus association was more prevalent in B-cell (23%) than T-cell (12%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and there was an increased risk of EBV association for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the pattern of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Malaysia is relatively similar to children elsewhere in the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The EBV association of B- and T-NHL differs between children and adults from the same medical center because of differences in the subtype composition in these two age groups </plain></SENT>
