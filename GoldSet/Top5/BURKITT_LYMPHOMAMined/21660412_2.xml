<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Generation of mAbs reactive with globotriaosylceramide (Gb3/CD77) was compared between A/J mice and Gb3/CD77 synthase-deficient (A4GalT-knockout) mice by immunizing Gb3-liposome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specificity and functions of established antibodies were examined by ELISA, TLC- immunostaining, cytotoxicity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells and immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with results with conventional mice, better generation of mAbs with higher functions has been achieved with A4GalT-knockout mice, i.e. acquisition of IgG class antibodies, activities in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and aggregation activity toward a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line Ramos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Binding of mAb k52 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the strongest phosphorylation bands turned out to be c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of B cell lines with mAbs resulted in the attenuation of BCR-mimicking signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these results suggested that A4GalT-knockout mice are very useful to generate mAbs against globo-series <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi>, and that suppressive signaling pathway driven by endogenous Gb3-ligand molecules might be present in B cells </plain></SENT>
