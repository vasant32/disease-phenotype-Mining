<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV reactivation has been clinically observed in patients receiving systemic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought in vitro evidence to suggest whether anticancer drugs may directly contribute to the EBV reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Raji cells, an EBV-containing Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, were used as the experimental model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> served as a positive control for chemical induction of EBV reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of the BZLF1 transcript of EBV and its encoded protein, ZEBRA, were examined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and flow cytometry, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transactivation activity of ZEBRA was further assessed by a luciferase reporter assay of EBV DR-promoter activity and a flow cytometry assay assessing the endogenous expression of EA-D (BMRFl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">Doxorubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, two commonly used anticancer agents, induced a dose-dependent up-regulation of BZLF1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and ZEBRA protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The luciferase reporter activity and the expression of endogenous EA-D protein, also increased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, indicated an up-regulation of the transactivating activity of ZEBRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data indicate that cytotoxic anticancer drugs may up-regulate the expression and the transactivating activity of BZLF1, and suggest that systemic chemotherapy may be a risk factor for EBV reactivation in patients with EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
