<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: During the last 20 years, 120 children with B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated at the National Pediatric Hematology/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Center of Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until 1986, 63 patients received an institutional protocol (BMC), and thereafter 57 patients received a modified French LMB protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the results of a retrospective analysis comparing the results of these two protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: Patient characteristics were similar in both groups except for stage of disease and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly more patients in the LMB group had higher stage disease, and the LDH levels also were higher (&lt;600 microg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-four of fifty-seven children on the modified LMB protocol are alive, disease-free, with an overall event-free survival of 94% (median follow-up of 73 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival for stages I, II, and III patients is 100%, and for stage IV 77%, whereas the overall event-free survival was 58% among 63 children treated previously, and for stage IV patients only 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe marrow suppression and neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004387'>enterocolitis</z:hpo> were the major complications of this intensive protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensive chemotherapy with a modified LMB protocol and modern supportive care result in a high cure rate of childhood B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> even in patients with advanced disease </plain></SENT>
