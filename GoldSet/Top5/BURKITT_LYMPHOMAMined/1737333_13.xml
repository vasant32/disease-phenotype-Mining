<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An invariant genetic lesion in mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> is deregulated expression of c-myc as a consequence of chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, retroviral and transgenic studies suggest that additional genetic lesions may contribute to the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene is a likely contributor to this genetic lesion, since there is a high incidence of p53 mutation in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> (L3), both of which contain translocations involving c-myc analogous to those in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, p53 has been shown to be a transcriptional modulator of c-myc expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a survey of 27 mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> by single-strand conformation polymorphism, we identified a single mutation (3.7% incidence), suggesting that p53 lesions are not frequent contributors to plasmacytomagenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar study of macrophage-monocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> generated by a c-myc-containing retrovirus also indicates a lack of p53 involvement in deregulated c-myc expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the specific maturation stage of transformed B-lymphocytes, independent of c-myc deregulation, may be the critical factor which determines the involvement of mutant p53 </plain></SENT>
