<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In further studying the mechanism of action of IFN-alpha in HCL, we cultured the HCL cell line JOK-1 and the IFN-sensitive Burkitt cell line Daudi with and without IFN-alpha and investigated the changes in density of a number of surface antigens by use of mAb and flow cytometry analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During culture with IFN-alpha, reproducible changes were induced in both cell lines, which were qualitatively similar but differed quantitatively with small and transient changes in JOK-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant decreases in surface antigen expression were observed for CD 19, 23, 37, and for IgM on both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, decreases were seen for CD 10, 22, 45, and MHC class II on Daudi, and for CD 20, 21, 27, and 40 on JOK-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, only a few antigens increased in density, including CD 39, A96/G8 and SC9, on both cell lines, CD 22 on JOK-1, and CD 21 on Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in CD 39, A96/G8 and SC9 was probably directly related to the mechanism of action of IFN-alpha, whereas the other changes were most consistent with an unspecific inhibition of protein synthesis, possibly due to an accumulation of cells in G0, even though a differentiating effect cannot be ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the unique in vivo effect of IFN-alpha in HCL was not paralleled by a specific direct effect on JOK-1 in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings therefore do not support the theory that IFN's mechanism of action in vivo is a direct effect on HC, but suggest that indirect effects are involved </plain></SENT>
