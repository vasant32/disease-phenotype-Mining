<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HDAC inhibitors are a class of compounds able to regulate gene expression by modulating chromatin structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are two major classes of HDAC inhibitors: the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24650">hydroxamic acid</z:chebi> derivatives such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">trichostatin A</z:chebi> (TSA) or SAHA, and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrates</z:chebi> such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HDAC inhibitors interfere with differentiation, proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the activity of a new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24650">hydroxamic acid</z:chebi> derivative, LAQ824, on lymphoblastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Four different pre-B lymphoblastic cell lines: Sup-B15 and TMD-5, both t(9;22) positive, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, t(4;11) positive, and NALM-6 cells were exposed to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24650">hydroxamic acid</z:chebi> derivatives, LAQ824 and TSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">Histone</z:chebi> hyperacetylation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, cell cycle and related pathways were assessed by flow cytometry and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LAQ824 significantly inhibited the proliferation of leukemic lymphoblastic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of LAQ824 was due to <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> accompanied by activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, cleavage of poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>)-polymerase (PARP) as well as by down-regulation of Bcl-2 and disruption of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, LAQ824-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was at least partially independent of caspase activation as indicated by the fact that LAQ824-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was inhibited only partially in both t(9;22) positive Sup-B15 and TMD-5 cells, whereas no inhibition was observed in t(4;11) positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> cells upon exposure to the polycaspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study establishes that LAQ824 is a promising agent for the therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
