<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, treatment must be tailored to the patient's living conditions and the availability of supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In some cases, a more intense regimen will decrease survival since the increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from toxicity may exceed any decrease in relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Attempts to practice evidence-based pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> are thwarted by the lack of evidence derived from local experience in LIC to determine optimal therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This report summarizes treatment regimens used by pediatric oncologists from 15 countries of the Caribbean, Central and South America who participate in the Monza International School of Pediatric Hematology/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> (MISPHO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath> treated on unmodified published protocols had outcomes comparable to those in high-income countries (HIC) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> is complicated by advanced stages and extraocular disease at diagnosis; improved outcomes depend on education of pediatricians and the public to recognize early signs of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Use of unmodified protocols for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> have been associated with unacceptable toxicity in LIC, so MISPHO centers have modified published regimens by giving lower doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and reducing use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
