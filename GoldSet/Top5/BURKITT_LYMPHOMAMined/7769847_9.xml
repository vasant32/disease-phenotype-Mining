<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IgH-CDR3 sequences were amplified using DNA extracted from clinical specimens (bone marrow, peripheral blood and fresh-frozen or paraffin-embedded lymph nodes) by a semi-nested PCR with consensus primers directed to conserved regions within the variable (VH) and the joining (JH) gene segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 17/20 samples (85%), a distinct IgH-CDR3 PCR product was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individual PCR products were sequenced after cloning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide sequences of 134 randomly chosen recombinant vectors were determined demonstrating in 17/20 cases (85%) monoclonal VH-N-DH-N-JH junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of PCR products by temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) confirmed the specificity of the IgH-CDR3 PCR/sequencing results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the combination of PCR/TGGE technology allowed the rapid and specific characterization of clonal IgH-CDR3 junctions in B cell proliferations by direct sequencing even in the presence of admixed polyclonal B cells </plain></SENT>
