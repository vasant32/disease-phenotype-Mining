<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, heterophile antibody was found in only six of 43 (14%) lepromatous patients and three of 41 (7%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overlap of the two types of antibody occurred only in one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is inferred that the presence of EBVC antibody against an unbiquitous virus in lepromatous patients who often suffer from impairment of cell-mediated immunity might be due to past <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> leading to persistence of the virus in their lymphoid cells and subsequent production of specific anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, the striking finding of low incidence and titre of EBVC antibody in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Indian adults is consistent with the rarity of EB virus-associated disease, such as Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> in India </plain></SENT>
