<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To characterize the signal transduction through the antigen receptor (AgR) on human B lymphocytes, we analyzed its association with other molecular components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The surface IgM (sIgM) complex isolated in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27729">digitonin</z:chebi> contains two surface expressed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi>--the previously described Ig alpha and Ig beta proteins--covalently linked to each other in a 48/39-kDa heterodimer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show herein that the human sIgM complex isolated from the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Ramos, or from dense tonsillar B cells contains additional molecules--160 kDa and 75 kDa in size--and enzymatic activities able to phosphorylate on tyrosine as well as serine/threonine residues the 39-, 48-, 75- and 160-kDa <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By specific immunoprecipitation with antibodies to src-family kinases, we consistently detected p56lyn in the sIgM complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the Ramos cell line, both p56lck and p59fyn activity were also observed, although to a much lesser extent than p56lyn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These kinases are associated with sIgM before cell stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As shown by two-dimensional electrophoresis, they interact in a tight complex with multimeric forms of the Ig alpha and Ig beta components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The kinases are active in vitro but must be highly regulated in vivo: Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed that stimulation of the AgR on viable B cells increased detectable phosphotyrosine residues on the components present in the sIgM complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these phosphorylation changes, the 39-, 48-, 75- and 160-kDa molecules are likely to be functionally active elements in an IgM complex crucial for the transduction of the antigenic signal </plain></SENT>
