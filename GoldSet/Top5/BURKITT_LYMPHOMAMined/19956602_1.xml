<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether monoclonal antibodies directed against IL-6 may enable to reverse resistance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We exposed ten haematological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> origins to cytotoxics or ionizing radiations and assessed the effects of anti-IL-6 antibody addition on cell proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, or IL-6 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A strong correlation between IL-6 secretion, measured by ELISA, and resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> as ionizing radiations was observed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> U266 and the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Daudi and Namalwa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although an anti-IL-6 antibody combined to both treatments efficiently blocked IL-6 signaling in U266 cells, expressing the IL-6 receptor gp80, it did not increase treatment-induced anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on these cells, as well as on Daudi and Namalwa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This lack of effect could be related to diverse factors: 1) a higher release of the soluble form of IL-6 receptor gp80 in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and irradiation from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines, 2) an impaired level of the IL-6 pathway inhibitor SOCS3 in Daudi cells, and 3) an increased release of IL-10 and TNFalpha, two cytokines involved in cell radio- and chemoresistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data support the fact that IL-6 is not the preponderant actor of cell resistance to cytotoxics and ionizing radiations, which seems to be regulated by a complex network of proteins </plain></SENT>
