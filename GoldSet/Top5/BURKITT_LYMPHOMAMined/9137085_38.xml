<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activation and proliferative response of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> investigated low-grade MALT-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n = 6) was strongly dependent on anti-CD40-mediated signals and was complemented by cytokines produced by T helper cells of the Th2 type (interleukin-4 (IL-4) and/or IL-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Th1 cytokines (IL-2 and/or interferon-gamma) bad little effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low-grade, but less so high-grade, MALT-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cells were induced to secrete large amounts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> immunoglobulin in response to IL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, high-grade MALT-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n = 5) proliferated in response to both Th2- and Th1-type cytokines and CD40 stimulation, whereas Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n = 3) could not be rescued from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by CD40 stimulation with or without cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that CD40 signaling in combination with Th2 cytokines are essential for the development and progression of low-grade MALT-type B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that T cells, which activate B cells in a CD40-dependent fashion, may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
