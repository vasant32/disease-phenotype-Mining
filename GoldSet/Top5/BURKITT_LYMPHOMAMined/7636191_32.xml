<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown that CD81 and CD82, two members of the transmembrane 4 superfamily, form multimolecular membrane complexes by associating with each other and with CD4 or CD8 in T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we further analyzed the molecular basis of the CD4 association with CD81 and CD82 by co-precipitation experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, we examined the regions of CD4 involved in the association with CD81 and CD82 by employing chimeric proteins generated from CD4 and CD2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was confirmed that CD4, but not CD2, was capable of binding with CD81 and CD82 in transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the cytoplasmic region of CD4 was sufficient for the chimeric proteins to co-precipitate CD81, while both the cytoplasmic and extracellular regions of CD4 were required for them to efficiently co-precipitate CD82 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We next found, by using truncated CD4 lacking the C-terminal 31 amino acids or mutated CD4 with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi> at 394 and 397 replaced by serine, that the p56lck binding site or the covalent modification with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> was not necessary for CD4 to associate with CD81 and CD82 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we found that the binding of p56lck to CD4 strongly inhibited its association with CD81 and CD82 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is, therefore, suggested that CD4 exists at least in two physical states, one associated with p56lck and another associated with CD81 and CD82 in the absence or uncoupling of p56lck </plain></SENT>
