<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human studies suggested a more global transcriptional role in antigen presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines were used as a model to examine the role of RelB in antigen presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After transient transfection of BJAB with RelB, strong nuclear expression of RelB-p50 heterodimers was associated with increased APC function and expression of CD40 and MHC class I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antisense RelB in DG75 reduced antigen-presenting capacity and CD40-mediated up-regulation of MHC molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that RelB transcriptional activity directly affects antigen presentation and CD40 synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of RelB transcriptional activity may provide a positive feedback loop for facilitating productive APC/T cell interactions </plain></SENT>
