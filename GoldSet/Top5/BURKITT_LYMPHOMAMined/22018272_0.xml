<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a novel five-way translocation, t(3;9;13;8;14)(q27;p13;q32;q24;q32), involving MYC, BCL6, and the immunoglobulin heavy locus (IGH@) in a 73-year-old man with BCLU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow was massively infiltrated with 95.6% abnormal medium- to large-sized lymphoid cells without vacuoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analyses indicated that the infiltrating cells were positive for CD10, CD19, CD20, CD25, HLA-DR, and Îº chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed that they were also positive for BCL2 and CD10, and weakly positive for BCL6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MIB1 index was approximately 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>G-banding and spectral karyotyping demonstrated the presence of a t(3;9;13;8;14)(q27;p13;q32;q24;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization detected an IGH/MYC fusion signal on the der(14)t(8;14)(q24;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, 5' and 3'BCL6 signals were separated onto the der(9)t(3;9)(q27;p13) and the der(3)t(3;14)(q27;q32), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, no BCL6 signal was found on the non-translocated chromosome 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, the revised karyotype was as follows: 49,XY,del(3)(q27q27),t(3;9;13;8;14)(q27;p13;q32;q24;q32), +der(6)t(6;13)(q13;q32)t(9;13)(p13;q32),+7,+12,i(18)(q10)[2]/50,sl,+7[2]/50,sl,+2[1] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that this five-way translocation could bring about the deregulated expression of MYC on the der(14)t(8;14) and BCL6 on the der(3)t(3;14) by the IGH@ enhancer/promoter in a single event and may have contributed to the development of this BCLU </plain></SENT>
