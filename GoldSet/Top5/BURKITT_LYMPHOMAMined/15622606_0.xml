<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: The study involved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with tissue proven diagnosis of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> during the study period of ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For each <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> case, the following were docummented age, sex, geographical (province) area, complaints, physical examination, investigation result findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study documented 961 children and 44 adults with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Male to female ratio was 1.5:1 in children and 1:1 in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the eight provinces in Kenya had cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and of the 44 tribes 22 were represented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> is a rapidly growing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> with peak duration of 4 weeks and main complaint was swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The major sites involved were Jaw 51.6%, abdomen 25%, combined jaw and abdomen 13.8% and other sites 9.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In adults, involved sites were jaw 4.5%, abdomen 43.2%, combined jaw and abdomen 25% and other sites 27.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease demonstrated in 39%, bone marrow 25% while <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function tests</z:hpo> were 18% and <z:mp ids='MP_0002136'>abnormal kidney functions</z:mp> 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Involved sites in children, jaw peaked at three years 66.7% and abdomen at 14 years 66.7% while in adults abdominal presentation was dominant at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore jaw were 55% males verses 16% females </plain></SENT>
