<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since recombinant immunotoxins can be easily manipulated in terms of affinity or cytotoxic potency and produced in large quantities, we have developed a new CD30 ligand-based fusion toxin (CD30L-<z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi>') </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human CD30L cDNA was ligated into a pET-based expression plasmid and thereby fused to a modified Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (<z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi>') lacking its cell-binding domain I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After IPTG-indiced expression in E. coli strain BL21(DE3), the 60 kDa His-tagged fusion protein (CD30L-<z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi>') was isolated from inclusion bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Denatured protein was renatured in the presence of 0.4 M arginine and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> redox system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Refolded protein was purified and concentrated by ion-exchange chromatography on a HiTrap Q column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The binding properties of CD30L-<z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi>' were evaluated by competitive ELISA, immunohistochemical staining, and FACS analysis on CD30-expressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The in vitro toxicity of the fusion protein was then tested on the CD30+ Hodgkin-derived cell line L540cy and the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BL38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD30L-<z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi>' exhibited specific cytotoxicity against L540cy cells (IC50 = 24 ng/ml) as determined by [3H]leucine uptake assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first report on the specificity and cytotoxic potency of a chimeric CD30L fusion toxin against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>-derived cells </plain></SENT>
