<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a subtraction/coexpression strategy, a murine genetic target for Myc regulation was isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further characterize this target gene, named ECA39, we have recently isolated the human, nematode and budding yeast homologs of the mouse gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The recognition site for Myc binding, located 3' to the start site of transcription in the mouse gene, is conserved in the human homolog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transfection experiments demonstrated that the Myc binding site of the human gene, mediates activation of a reporter gene in response to over-expression of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The activation was better executed when the c-Myc binding element was positioned downstream to the promoter, which is the usual position of the c-Myc DNA binding element in its genetic targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The tissue specific expression of human ECA39 during embryogenesis is similar to that of the mouse homolog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ECA39 is expressed in c-myc induced human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is expressed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (where c-myc is translocated and activated) but not in non Burkitt's B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or in T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, it seems that ECA39 is a target for c-myc <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In yeast, where c-myc is absent, the ECA39 sequences lack the c-Myc binding element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the promoter region of the yeast ECA39 harbors several Gcn4 binding elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ECA39 is markedly down regulated in cells deleted for gcn4, and deletion of Gcn4 binding elements down regulated the transcription from ECA39 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We thus suggest that ECA39 is a target for c-Myc regulation in mammals, while in yeast the regulator is not c-Myc but the c-Jun/c-Fos homolog - Gcn4 </plain></SENT>
