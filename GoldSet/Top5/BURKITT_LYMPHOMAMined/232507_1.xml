<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of this assay was comparable to that of the indirect immunofluorescent technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurement of early antigen was accomplished on a producer cell line which was specifically treated to block late gene expression </plain></SENT>
