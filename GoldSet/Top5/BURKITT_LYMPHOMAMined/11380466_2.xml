<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>p15 and/or p16 gene deletions were seen in 6% and 8%, respectively, of BP-ALL samples; however, losses of p15 and/or p16 transcripts were seen in 26 out of 63 (41%) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Loss of p15 transcripts (36.5%) exceeded that for p16 (17.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the 26 BP-ALLs that lacked p15 and/or p16 transcripts, only six (23%) exhibited low levels of DHFR by flow cytometry assay with Pt430, a fluorescent anti-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, 18 out of 37 (49%) BP-ALL samples with intact p15 and/or p16 genes and transcripts showed low levels of DHFR (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In p15- and p16-null K562 cells transfected with a <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-inducible p15 cDNA construct, induction of p15 transcripts and protein was accompanied by <z:mp ids='MP_0001732'>decreased growth rates</z:mp>, decreased S-phase fraction, decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein phosphorylation, and markedly reduced levels of DHFR transcripts and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our results suggest that losses of p15 and/or p16 gene expression result in elevated levels of DHFR in BP-ALL in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, additional downstream factors undoubtedly also contribute to elevated levels of this enzyme target </plain></SENT>
