<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A test is proposed which is an appropriate linear combination of stratum-specific Wilcoxon tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An estimator for the mean percentile shift between the case and control exposure levels is given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods for assessing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the mean percentile shift across strata are also discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The performance of the test as a function of the number of controls per case is studied for both local and distant alternatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The asymptotic relative efficiency compared to the best parametric test with the same number of controls is evaluated and its performance is compared to tests based on a dichotomized exposure variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the method is illustrated by two numerical examples </plain></SENT>
