<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We characterize the natural killer (NK) cell colony-inhibiting activity (CIA) produced in supernatants from cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with NK-sensitive target cell lines, and study its relationship with NK cell-derived cytotoxic factor (NKCF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for NK cells or other lymphocyte populations, we unambiguously identify NK cells as the only PBL subset able to produce both NKCF and NK-CIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present functional and biochemical data suggesting that NKCF and NK-CIA represent the same molecule: (a) a highly significant positive correlation exists between the quantity of NKCF and NK-CIA in supernatants independently produced by different PBL subsets; (b) both NK-CIA and NKCF are induced by culture of PBL with NK-sensitive, but not with NK-insensitive cell lines, and with HLA-DR+ bone marrow cells; (c) both NKCF and NK-CIA are absorbed on the same cell lines or bone marrow cell types; (d) the two activities coelute in the same gel filtration fractions; (e) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17369,48066">D-mannose-6-phosphate</z:chebi> blocks both NKCF and NK-CIA activity, and prevents their absorption by K562 cells; and (f) both NKCF and NK-CIA activity are lost after 2 d at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The NK-CIA-containing preparations are devoid of antiviral activity, and antiinterferon (anti-IFN) antibodies do not block the inhibitor activity of NK-CIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of NK-CIA on day 14 (early) colony-forming units of granulocytes and macrophages (CFU-GM) is synergistic with that of IFN-gamma, and this synergy is also evident on day 7 (late) CFU-GM growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A combination of NK-CIA and IFN-gamma suppresses late CFU-GM, at concentrations of the two lymphokines that are completely ineffective when used independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No synergy between NK-CIA and IFN-alpha or -beta was observed, due to a direct inhibitory effect of these two IFN types on late CFU-GM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antibodies specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF), but not those specific for lymphotoxins, inhibit both NK-CIA and NKCF activity in the NK cell-derived supernatant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recombinant TNF, in the range of concentrations corresponding to that of the cytotoxic activity on L-929 cells present in supernatants, mediated both NKCF and NK-CIA activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
