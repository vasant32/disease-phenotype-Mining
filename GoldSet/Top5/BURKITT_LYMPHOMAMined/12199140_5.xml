<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cohesin multiprotein complex, conserved in eukaryotes, is required for sister chromatid cohesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human cohesion is composed of a stable heterodimer of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family proteins, hSMC1 and hSMC3, and non-SMC components, hRAD21 and SA1 (or SA2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In yeast, cohesion associates with chromosomes from late G1 to metaphase and is required for the establishment and maintenance of both chromosome arm and centromeric cohesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in human cells, the majority of cohesion dissociates from chromosomes before mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although it was recently shown that a small amount of hRAD21 localizes to the centromeres during metaphase, the presence of other cohesion components at the centromere has not been demonstrated in human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here we report the mitosis-specific localization of hSMC1 to the kinetochores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>hSMC1 is targeted to the kinetochore region during prophase concomitant with kinetochore assembly and remains through anaphase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, hSMC1 is targeted only to the active centromere on dicentric chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that hSMC1 is an integral component of the functional kinetochore structure during mitosis </plain></SENT>
