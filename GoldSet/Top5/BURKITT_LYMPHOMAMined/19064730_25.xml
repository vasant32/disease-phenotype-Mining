<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of a novel, pan-AKT kinase inhibitor, GSK690693, on the proliferation of 112 cell lines representing different hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines tested were sensitive to AKT inhibitor (EC(50)&lt;1 microM), with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showing 89%, 73%, and 67% sensitivity to GSK690693, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antiproliferative effect was selective for the malignant cells, as GSK690693 did not inhibit the proliferation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human CD4(+) peripheral T lymphocytes as well as mouse thymocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of downstream substrates of AKT was reduced in both sensitive and insensitive cell lines on treatment with GSK690693, suggesting that the cause of resistance was not related to the lack of AKT kinase inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the role of AKT in cell survival, GSK690693 also induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in sensitive ALL cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, our data provide direct evidence for the role of AKT signaling in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, especially ALL and some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
