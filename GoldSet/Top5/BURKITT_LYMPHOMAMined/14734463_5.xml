<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little information is available on interleukin-18 receptor (IL-18R) and IL-18 expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to investigate this issue in human naive, germinal center (GC) and memory B cells, and in their neoplastic counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental Design: We have evaluated IL-18 expression and production in tonsil naive, GC, and memory B cells and in their presumed neoplastic counterparts by reverse transcription-PCR and ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, IL-18Ralpha and beta expression was investigated in the same cells by reverse transcription-PCR, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that: (a) IL-18 mRNA was expressed in tonsil naive, GC, and memory B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bioactive IL-18 was secreted by naive and GC, but not by memory B cells; (b) IL-18Ralpha and beta transcripts were expressed in the three B-cell subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-18Ralpha was detected on the surface of naive, GC, and memory B lymphocytes, and IL-18Rbeta was detected on GC and memory, but not naive, B cells; (c) mantle zone, follicular, marginal zone, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) cells expressed IL-18 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>B-CLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells did not produce bioactive IL-18; and (d) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cells displayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> expression of either or both IL-18R chain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, B-CLL cells expressed both IL-18R chains at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dysregulated expression of IL-18 and/or IL-18R in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> may sometimes contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> escape from the host immune system </plain></SENT>
