<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The activation, clonal expansion and terminal differentiation of small resting B lymphocytes primed by an antigen (or antibodies to its receptors) appear to follow an orderly developmental sequence triggered at each stage by distinct soluble cytokines, primarily produced by T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For man, the only known B-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> independent of accessory cells for its action is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes transformed by EBV are released from the usual constraints on B-cell growth, proliferating continuously in the absence of any exogenous cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resultant cell lines are of special interest as they possess certain features compatible with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282313" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preneoplastic state</z:e> of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, one of two human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with which the virus is intimately associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here that following EBV-transformation, B lymphoblasts release a soluble factor which mimics the B-cell stimulatory product(s) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-conditioned T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the virally-transformed cells utilize this activity to sustain their own growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ectopic production of an otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth factor may represent a critical event in the malignant evolution of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> harbouring the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
