<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The changes occurring in the expression of a membrane-associated antigen following binding of specific antibodies and the fate of the bound antibodies were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Daudi cells, carrying membrane 7S IgM molecules, were coated with radio-labelled anti-IgM antibodies and incubated under culture conditions at 37degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within 10 h, more than 80% of the cellbound radioactivity was shed from the cells into the culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, IgM molecules were lost, as the cells had a diminished ability to bind a new aliquot of antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon occurred also when the antibody was used at a low concentration, i.e. did not saturate the cell-surface antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The precipitability of the antibody released from the cells with 10% <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> and 40% saturated <z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> was lower than that of native antibody, indicating some degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, shed antibody could rebind to fresh Daudi cells less efficiently than native antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of immune complexes in the culture supernatants was indicated by the following results: (1) some of the shed radioactivity could bind to IgM-negative but Fc receptor-bearing cells; and (2) immune precipitates of sheep anti-IgM shed from 3H-leucine labelled Daudi cells and of rabbit anti-sheep IgG antibodies contained 3H activity </plain></SENT>
