<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Daudi cells, sublytic amounts of these agents induce the following changes: collapse of surface membrane potential, uptake of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> and loss of K+ from cells, and leakage of phosphorylated metabolites from cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The changes induced by Sendai virus and complement are sensitive to physiological concentrations of extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that fluctuations in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentration may affect the damaging action of certain pore-forming agents on susceptible cells </plain></SENT>
