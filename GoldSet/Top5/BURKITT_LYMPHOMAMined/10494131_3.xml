<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vivo and ex vivo FNA biopsy yielded the material for FCM, which comprised an extensive number of lymphoid cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but three cases sufficient cells were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was diagnosed in 33 cases from a total of 47 (70.2%), and in the remaining cases <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases were correctly diagnosed as reactive processes (11/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no false positive cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, as diagnosed by FCM-FNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The best accuracy was achieved in the low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in a significant number of cases, FCM-FNA permits the separation between lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and reactive processes without false positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was found to be particularly useful in the differential diagnosis of mantle-cell and small-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in the identification of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
