<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we evaluated the combinational treatment capability of RTX and MTX using an alternative treatment schedule against <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> animal model that closely mimics the morphological and molecular characteristics of human <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by injecting Raji human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells into the brains of immune-compromised mice and tested a novel combinational treatment schedule by which penetration of RTX was not influenced by MTX administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RTX was conjugated with Alexa <z:chebi fb="2" ids="24061">Fluor</z:chebi> 680, and its distribution in the brain was analyzed by in vivo imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When MTX treatment was followed by a 3-day post RTX administration, RTX was scarcely distributed in the brain, and there were only modest statistically insignificant therapeutic effects compared with the control mice which received sham injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, RTX administration followed by a 3-day post MTX treatment showed significantly increased distribution of RTX and significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our data demonstrate that RTX can be successfully combined with MTX using an alternative treatment schedule that allows increased distribution of RTX in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
