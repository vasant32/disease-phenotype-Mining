<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We have investigated whether the extent of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in the marrows obtained at the completion of chemotherapy can predict subsequent relapse in children with B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Marrow samples of 24 patients were examined for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> at the end of treatment using a quantitative method based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the complementarity determining region-3 of the immunoglobulin heavy chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 15 patients who remain in continuous bone marrow remission (range, 41 to 98 months), 14 had no detectable leukemic cells; one patient had a very low level (one in approximately 335,000 marrow cells) of residual leukemic cells that underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the nine patients who had a marrow relapse after the completion of treatment, eight patients whose relapses occurred 4 to 54 months from the end of therapy had no detectable leukemic cells, whereas only the one patient who relapsed 2 months after the completion of therapy had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">detectable residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These observations indicate that the absence of detectable residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> by PCR at the end of chemotherapy is not sufficient to assure that the patient is cured and suggest that frequent serial monitoring is required for the early prediction of relapse off therapy </plain></SENT>
