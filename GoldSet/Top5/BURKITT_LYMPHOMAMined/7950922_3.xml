<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was established histologically according to WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> represented 48.5% of NHL in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age of patients was 5 years with a sex (M/F) ratio of 2.3/1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common primary site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> involvement at initial presentation was the abdomen (70.4%), which was followed by facial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, in particular the jaw and orbit (45.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients (84.0%) were in advanced stages (C and D) at initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Facial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> observed in Turkish children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were more similar to African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than American or European cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High titers of antibodies against VCA and EA of EBV were also observed in 32 recent cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preliminary molecular and immunologic studies revealed EBV-DNA (type I) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001831'>T cell deficiency</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation, median age, and association with EBV revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> appears to be inbetween African and non-African types in Turkish children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This will be further elucidated in the future by direct examination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells for EBV and investigation of the molecular characteristics in these cases </plain></SENT>
