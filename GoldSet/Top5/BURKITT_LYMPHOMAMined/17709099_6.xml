<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have recently been reported to specifically kill malignant cells of B-lymphoid origin, i.e., cells derived from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, SSRIs have been proposed as <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33585">lead compounds</z:chebi> in the development of new approaches to the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we attempted to dissect the underlying signaling pathways by comparing susceptible and resistant cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, we found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines investigated underwent apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> when exposed to SSRI concentrations exceeding 10 microM regardless of whether the cell lines were derived from B- (e.g., Namalwa, Ramos, Daudi, RL7), T-<z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp> (e.g., Molt-4, Jurkat, CCRF-CEM) or other sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The structure-activity relationship readily distinguished the pro-apoptotic and growth inhibitory effect of SSRIs from their eponymous action (blockage of the <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> transporter): acetylation of the SSRIs <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5138">fluvoxamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7936">paroxetine</z:chebi> abrogated the ability of these compounds to inhibit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi>-uptake, but did not impair their cytotoxic action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on these data we conclude that (i) SSRIs inhibit growth of transformed cells, but that (ii) this effect is neither specific for malignant cells nor specific for any particular cellular subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(iii) The pro-apoptotic effect of SSRIs (at microM concentrations) is unrelated to their principal pharmacological action, i.e., inhibition of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> uptake (at nM concentrations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SSRIs or improved versions thereof are therefore unlikely to represent useful <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33585">lead compounds</z:chebi> for inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in B-cell derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>: the underlying mechanism is not confined to any specific cell lineage </plain></SENT>
