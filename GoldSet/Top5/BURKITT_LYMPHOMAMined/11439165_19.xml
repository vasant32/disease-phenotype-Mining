<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FLICE-inhibitory proteins (FLIPs) are important modulators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, the FLIP family encompasses multiple members, of which some are reported to be antiapoptotic and others pro-apoptotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This led us to investigate the activity of several FLIP proteins in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concomitant with the cloning of various FLIP isoforms, a new and unexpected member of the FLIP family, denoted FLIPR, was isolated from the human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B-cell line Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the characterization of FLIPR, the genomic sequence of human FLIP was found in the NCBI GenBank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This enabled us to present the complete exon-intron constellation of the human FLIP gene and the generation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known human FLIP isoforms by alternative splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show that the human FLIP gene with a size of approximately 48 kb, consists of at least 14 exons and can give rise to 11 distinct isoforms by alternative splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When studying the activity of some of these isoforms, including FLIPR, they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> efficiently inhibited Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in A20 B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells by impeding caspase-8, -3 and -7 activity as well as poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP) cleavage </plain></SENT>
