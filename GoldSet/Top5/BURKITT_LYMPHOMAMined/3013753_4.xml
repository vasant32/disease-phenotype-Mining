<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have screened a human genomic DNA library with an immunoglobulin (Ig) derived switch (S) region specific probe for homologous sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five Ig independent phage clones were isolated and characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The S sequence homologous DNA fragments are short compared to the S region sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ig independent S sequences are flanked by highly repetitive DNA elements and perfect inverted repeats can be demonstrated in their close vicinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using subclones of S homologous sequences restriction fragment length polymorphisms were shown within DNA of different T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, lymphoblastoid cell lines, and DNA of healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the five clones isolated with the S region probe was evidently localized to chromosome 2 and/or 10 and showed a complex hybridisation pattern with several different human DNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>S homologous sequences of another clone are most likely localized on chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is possible that these Ig independent S sequences have arisen by amplification and transposition and that they are involved in genetic recombination </plain></SENT>
