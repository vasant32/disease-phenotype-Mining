<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Virus-producing EB3 cells, however, contain the R component as well as VCA so that the correct anti-VCA titers in such cases remain in doubt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the R component, but not VCA, was found to be denatured by <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi> fixation, the parallel use of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="15347">acetone</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi>-fixed EB3 cell smears permitted the determination of the correct anti-VCA titer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that the anti-R titers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients can in fact be up to eightfold higher than the anti-VCA titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-R titers equaling or exceeding anti-VCA titers have been encountered thus far only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
