<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several polychemotherapeutic approaches are utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> identified according to the Kiel classification were analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic modifications depended upon the different times of the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients received the LSA2-L2 regimen, 11 patients were treated with third generation polychemotherapeutic regimens for high-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>: F-MACHOP and MACOP-B, and 1 elderly patient was given the COP regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 patients treated with cyclic conventional therapy (7 with F-MACHOP and 4 with MACOP-B), 8 achieved a complete response (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 8 patients who were given the LSA2-L2 protocol, 4 obtained a CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One elderly patient treated with the COP regimen obtained a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early stage of disease, low levels of LDH, and the absence of bone marrow involvement were characteristics of patients with good prognoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Effective conventional third-generation polychemotherapy regimens (F-MACHOP and MACOP-B), normally used for high-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, were equally effective for a large fraction of adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our study confirms the important role of LDH level, stage, and bone marrow involvement as prognostic factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> as well as the roles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden in the CR rate and relapse-free survival </plain></SENT>
