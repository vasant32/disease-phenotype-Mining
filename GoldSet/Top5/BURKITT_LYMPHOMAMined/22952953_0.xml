<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> pathway is altered in many human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> this is reflected by the presence of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplets which are visible in the cytoplasm of neoplastic cells in cytological preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These vacuoles are not identifiable in biopsy section as <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> are "lost" during tissue processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study we investigated the expression of genes involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, at both <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein level in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in other B-cell aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profile indicated a significant over-expression of the adipophilin gene and marked up-regulation of other genes involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings were confirmed by immunohistochemistry on a series od additional histological samples: 45 out of 47 BL cases showed strong adipophilin expression, while only 3 cases of the 33 of the not-Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> category showed weak adipophilin expression (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest that <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism is altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, and this leads to the accumulation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> vacuoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These vacuoles may be specifically recognized by a monoclonal antibody against adipophilin, which may therefore be a useful marker for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> because of its peculiar expression pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> might represent an interesting candidate for interventional strategies </plain></SENT>
