<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies were performed on four Chinese patients with EBV-associated T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>: three peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and one large granular lymphocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with coexpression of T-cell antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements of chromosome 7 were observed in three patients: one at 7p22, one at 7q35 or 36, and the remaining one at both sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The last patient also had a chromosomal abnormality involving 14q11 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that the chromosomal abnormalities in these patients were similar to those observed in other T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
