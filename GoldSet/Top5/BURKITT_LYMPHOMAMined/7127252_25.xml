<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had a median age at presentation of ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary site of disease in these patients was more commonly extranodal; at the time of diagnosis 26 (66%) of these cases revealed intra-abdominal involvement; 25 (64%) of the cases were Stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 27 patients with non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had a median age at presentation of 34 years; the primary site of disease was more commonly nodal (peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp> was often present at the time of diagnosis); only nine (33%) of the cases were Stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median survival was essentially equivalent in the two groups, 9.5 months for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 10.0 months for the non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, survival was not significantly different among the two patient populations; however, patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had a longer survival than those with non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Estimates of five-year survival (with 95% confidence) are 42% for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 11% for non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, respectively, which are significantly different (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
