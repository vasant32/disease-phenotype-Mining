<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SAL uniformly bound to surfaces of Gb3-expressing (Gb3+) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, while Gb3 molecules were interspersed on the surfaces of Gb3+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a short period of treating Raji and Daudi cells with SAL, each cell size was 10 and 25% smaller than that of untreated cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of Gb3+ cells with SAL caused an increase in binding of annexin V, however, neither caspase activation nor DNA fragmentation was observed after treatment with SAL for 22 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since SAL did not induce cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in Gb3+ cells, SAL may function as an inducer of early apoptotic signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have revealed that SAL did not bind to D-threo-1-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-2-decanoylamino-3-morphorino-1-propanol (D-PDMP)-treated Raji cells, and no cell shrinkage was observed in Gb3-deficient Raji cells treated with SAL, indicating that Gb3 localized in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi>-enriched microdomain (GEM) was involved in SAL-induced cell shrinkage through activation of voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel Kv1.3, and that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> ligands on Gb3-deficient Raji cells treated with SAL were not included in this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that SAL leads the cells to early apoptotic status via binding to Gb3 existing in GEM, and that this binding is a prerequisite condition to induce early stage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
