<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the capacity of different hematopoietic cell lines to form rosettes with MRBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cell lines represent different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> and the results with these lines were compared with those obtained with non-malignant EBV carrying lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines only exceptional lines, 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> and 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> lines, showed rosetting capacity with MRBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most LCL, however, bound MRBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that only 1 category of established hematopoietic cell line, the LCL, has MRBC receptors and that thus a further subset of B-lymphocyte, the one represented by LCL, has the capacity for rosetting with MRBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This MRBC rosetting of LCL is, however, not restricted to those lines with S-IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> lines of hematopoietic origin seem, however, in general to lack MRBC receptors, even such lines that are derived from malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> which express other B-lymphocyte characteristics </plain></SENT>
