<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The immunologic phenotypes of 59 cases of diffuse, aggressive, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were determined using a battery of immunologic and cytochemical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Included were cases of diffuse, large cell "histiocytic," mixed cell, undifferentiated non-Burkitt's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036920" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">SÃ©zary's syndrome</z:e> were excluded from this study since these are distinct clinicopathologic entities with well-recognized immunologic phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunotype could be determined in 57/59 (97%) cases tested: 31 of 59 cases (53%) were B-cell type, 25 of 59 (42%) were peripheral T-cell type, and one was true histiocytic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two cases had no detectable markers and were called "null cell." This relatively high frequency of peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in an American series previously has not been observed and may be a result of progressive improvements in immunologic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal anti-T cell antibody staining was performed in 11 T-cell cases and corroborated the findings using spontaneous E-rosette formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight of the T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had a helper <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> whereas one had a suppressor <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> and two could not be subclassified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in this series possessed monoclonal surface immunoglobulin detected by direct immunofluorescence of viable cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Enzyme cytochemistry profiles only partially correlated with immunotype and were not believed to be helpful in the determination of specific phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the B-cell and T-cell diffuse aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with respect to sex, constitutional symptoms, stages, sites of extranodal involvement, complete remission rate, or survival when they were studied prior to the initiation of aggressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although immunotyping can be successfully performed in essentially <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of diffuse, aggressive non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, to date, the authors have been unable to demonstrate that immunotype alone has an independent prognostic effect </plain></SENT>
