<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have hypothesized that adenoviral vectors might mediate gene transfer into cell lines derived from human lymphocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A panel of 33 cell lines was studied for their ability to be transduced by an adenoviral (AD) vector encoding the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene (AD-betagal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cytochemical assay and a flow cytometry assay both demonstrated that a subset of lymphocytic cell lines can be efficiently transduced by adenoviral vectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, three of three anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, two of two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> cell lines, two of seven Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, and three of five <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines exhibited efficient gene transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ability of an AD vector expressing the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase (tk) gene from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus-1 (AD-tk) followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> (GCV) to kill 11 of these lymphocytic cell lines was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In eight of the cell lines tested, more than 68% of the cells were killed by AD-tk/GCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained using an adenoviral vector expressing the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene (AD-p53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, AD-tk/GCV and AD-p53 both demonstrated efficient killing of these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data document that adenoviral vectors are valuable reagents for the introduction of genes into selected lymphocytic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data also suggest that adenoviral vectors might be useful for gene therapy of subsets of lymphocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
