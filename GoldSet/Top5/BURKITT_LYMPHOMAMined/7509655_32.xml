<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the mechanisms by which the HD37 Ab exerts antitumor activity in vivo by studying its activity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that it has antiproliferative activity (IC50 = 5.2 - 9.8 x 10(-7) mol/L) on three CD19+ Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (Daudi, Raji, and Namalwa) but not on a weakly CD19-positive (CD19lo) pre-B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (Nalm-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect was manifested by cell cycle arrest, but not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results using three additional anti-CD19 Abs, suggest that the affinity of the antibody and possibly the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> which it recognizes may effect its capacity to transmit a signal that induces cell cycle arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence, therapeutically useful Abs may exert anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity by a variety of mechanisms, each of which should be evaluated before undertaking clinical trials in humans </plain></SENT>
