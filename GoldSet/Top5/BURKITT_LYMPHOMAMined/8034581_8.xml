<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One mechanism by which cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells inflict target cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> depends upon secreting the contents of their specialized cytoplasmic granules, containing a pore-forming protein, perforin, and a family of homologous serine proteases ("granzymes") with various enzyme activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a granzyme B-specific mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody 2C5 and Western blotting to demonstrate that nuclear extracts of human interleukin-2-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the human NK <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line YT, and the rat NK <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line RNK-16 contain abundant granzyme B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In interleukin-2-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, more than 50% of the total cellular granzyme B was present in the nuclear lysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nuclear granzyme B had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 32 kDa in human cells and approximately 30 kDa in RNK-16 and was eluted from immobilized <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> at the same <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> concentration as granzyme B from cytoplasmic granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Granzyme B that was affinity-purified with 2C5 from the nuclei of YT or human LAK cells was capable of efficiently cleaving synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> thiobenzyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> substrates with the same specificity (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> cleavage after aspartic acid) as granule-localized granzyme B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast perforin, which colocalizes with granzymes in cytotoxic granules, was not detectable in nuclear lysates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Granzyme B was also demonstrated to be present in the nucleus and cytoplasmic granules of YT by immunohistochemical staining with monospecific anti-granzyme B antisera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other protease activities (tryptase and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> cleavage after methionine) were also readily detectable in nuclear and cytoplasmic lysates of YT, RNK-16, and LAK cells, as determined by the cleavage of the synthetic substrates N alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi> thiobenzyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (BLT) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="48502">Boc</z:chebi>-Ala-Ala-Met-S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22744">benzyl</z:chebi>, except that BLT-esterase activity was absent from the nucleus of YT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The localization of serine proteases in the nucleus was restricted to lymphocytes with cytotoxic capacity, as non-cytotoxic cell lines expressed high levels of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> cleavage after methionine and tryptase activities in their cytoplasm, but possessed no nuclear serine protease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, non-cytotoxic monkey kidney COS-7 cells transfected with an SV40-driven expression plasmid incorporating full-length human granzyme B cDNA contained abundant cytoplasmic granzyme B, but demonstrated minimal nuclear granzyme B accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that serine proteases of NK cells are not restricted to cytolytic granules and, further, that their capacity to access the nucleus may have implications for the role of these enzymes in eliciting target cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
