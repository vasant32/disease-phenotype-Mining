<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Taking advantage of clone-specific DNA sequences, generated during lymphocyte differentiation and the polymerase chain reaction, some strategies have been developed for several groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Up to now the most specific and sensitive methodology, which consists of designing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-specific oligonucleotides, requires sequencing of the complementary determining region III-DNA for each particular patient and is too laborious to be applied to each case for routine monitoring in most hospital laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to achieve an easy way to detect residual malignant cells in B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e>, we have used a new PCR-based approach, named here as PCR-nuclease protection assay, consisting of: (i) amplification of DNA segments corresponding to the complementarity determining region III of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes from samples at disease diagnosis; (ii) isolation of the disease-specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi>; (iii) labeling of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi> to generate specific probes; (iv) hybridization to amplified DNA from samples corresponding to different disease phases; and (v) digestion with S1-nuclease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this approach, we could detect one malignant cell in a background of 10(5) healthy cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of this approach compares with those of the above mentioned specific oligonucleotide strategy in detecting residual malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this strategy is much less tedious and could be used by most hospital laboratories </plain></SENT>
