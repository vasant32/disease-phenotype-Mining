<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The decay is temperature and time related and is presumably due to intrinsic enzymatic action, probably ribonuclease </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The absence of pyroninophilia after these intervals at the appropriate temperatures should not detract from the diagnosis of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
