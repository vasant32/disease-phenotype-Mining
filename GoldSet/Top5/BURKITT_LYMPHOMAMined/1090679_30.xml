<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radioiodinated SpA was employed in a radioimmuno technique to assay IgG antibodies which had reacted with cell membrane antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Red blood cells coated with SpA were used as an indicator system in the mixed haemadsorption technique to detect IgG antibodies on tissue culture cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that SpA was highly specific in the various systems tested, although it was not as sensitive in the immunofluorescence test as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> anti-IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was confirmed that SpA reacts with IgG antibodies of human, monkey, rabbit, sheep and mice origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reactivity with human and monkey IgG was stronger than with IgG of the other species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We consider labeled SpA as an alternative to monospecific anti-IgG for detection and assaying of IgG antibodies to tissue and cell surface antigens </plain></SENT>
