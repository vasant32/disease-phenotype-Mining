<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To detect the presence of variability in the tandemly repeated sequences of the Epstein-Barr virus latent origin of replication, we analyzed the length of the family of repeats in 14 lymphoblastoid and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines by PCR amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gel electrophoresis analysis of the PCR products revealed a broad banding pattern, characteristic of each line, consisting of several fragments, sometimes smeared, of variable length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding was interpreted as a result of the hairpin-like structures generated by the palindrome within the family of repeats, able to originate artefacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the banding pattern was different only in strictly non-correlated cell lines, we supposed that the sequence of the repeat units was polymorphic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore sequenced the family of repeats in three healthy bone marrow derived lymphoblastoid cell lines carrying an endogenous EBV as well as in a B95-8 infected cell line as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sequence analysis revealed that each line is different both in the number and in the sequence of repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the 3' end of the family of repeats the B95-8 virus was found to have a 252 bp region missing in the GenBank standard sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This one is probably a partial sequence since it was shorter than the control specimens obtained from different sources of B95-8 DNA analyzed by Southern blot hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The length analysis of the family of repeats can be used to characterize EBV strains by PCR </plain></SENT>
