<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>3.1.1.1) were studied in 74 proven human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cell lines have been extensively phenotyped using poly- and monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Esterase isoenzymes were separated by isoelectric focusing and visualized by histo-cytochemical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-specific or (except for monocytes) blood cell type-specific isoenzyme or isoenzyme pattern could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The monocytic element in some cell lines was characterized by a strong isoenzyme band which could be selectively and completely inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28741">sodium fluoride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The enzyme phenotypes were stably expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subcultures of a given cell line and did not appear to have any cell cycle dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines have been subclassified into four major groups according to immunological parameters: T-cell, B-cell, myelomonocytic and non-T, non-B-cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of immunological data the T-cell lines were assigned to five stages of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number and staining intensity of the isoenzymes increased with differentiation of the T-cells paralleling the expression of immunological markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines were divided into pre B-, B-, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Substantial variability among the isoenzyme patterns was detected ranging from immature profiles of pre B-cell lines to complete isoenzyme repertoires of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was seen between the isoenzymes of mature B-cell lines and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The most prominent feature seen in myelomonocytic cell lines was the monocytic band indicating a monocytic origin and separating the 'monocytoid' from the 'pure myeloid' cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the isoenzyme patterns was observed in the non-T, non-B cell groups which comprised <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> cell lines and cell lines arrested at a very early stage of lymphoid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These latter cell lines together with some T- and B-cell lines shared the common characteristics of positivity for cALLA, TdT and Ia antigens and an immature, incomplete isoenzyme profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The results support the notions of maturation arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gene expression in leukemic cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the importance of biochemical studies as part of the multiple marker analysis could be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
