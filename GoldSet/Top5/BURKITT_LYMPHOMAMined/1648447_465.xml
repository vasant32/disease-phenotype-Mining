<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect upon cell survival is best recognized in EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines where activation of full virus latent gene expression protects the cells from programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show by DNA transfection into human B cells that protection from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is conferred through expression of a single EBV latent protein, the latent membrane protein LMP 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that LMP 1 mediates this effect by up-regulating expression of the cellular oncogene bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interplay between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and expression of this cellular oncogene has important implications for virus persistence and for the pathogenesis of virus-associated malignant disease </plain></SENT>
