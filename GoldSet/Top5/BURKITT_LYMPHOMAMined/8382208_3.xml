<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) are two closely related integral membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> involved in signalling of cell growth and metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used the unique paradigm of pairs of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (BLO2, BL30, BL41) with or without Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and cells transfected with EBV-related genes to examine effects of EBV on expression of these receptors at the gene and protein functional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In BL30 and BL41 cells, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> increased surface insulin binding and total receptor number by 2- and 18-fold, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> decreased total IGF-I receptors by 29 to 87% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In general, there was a correlation between total receptor concentration and the level of insulin or IGF-I receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>, although in one cell line insulin binding increased while receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels decreased slightly, suggesting posttranslational effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BL41 cells transfected with a vector expressing the EBV latent membrane protein (LMP) exhibited a 2.6- to 3.2-fold increase in insulin receptor expression, whereas cells transfected with EBNA-2 (one of the EBV nuclear antigens) alone exhibited no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, EBNA-2 appears to be required for the EBV effect on insulin receptor expression since cells infected with a mutant virus, P3JHRI, which lacks the EBNA-2 gene failed to show an increase in insulin receptor number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> of lymphocytes increases expression of insulin receptors while simultaneously decreasing expression of IGF-I receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The magnitude and sometimes even the direction of change, depends on host cell factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A maximal increase in insulin receptors appears to require the coordinate action of several of the EBV proteins including LMP and EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
