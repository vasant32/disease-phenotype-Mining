<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We postulated that intensification of chemotherapy immediately after remission induction might reduce the leukemic cell burden sufficiently to allow an abbreviated period of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolite</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred forty-seven children (ages 1 to 15 years) with previously untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) were enrolled onto the Tokyo L92-13 study, which excluded patients with mature B-cell ALL and patients less than 1 year old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-four patients were classified as standard risk, 122 as high risk, and 101 as extremely high risk, according to age, peripheral-blood leukocyte count, selected genetic abnormalities, and immunophenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects received four drugs for remission induction, followed by a risk-directed multidrug intensification phase and therapy for presymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maintenance chemotherapy with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50667">mercaptopurine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> was administered for 6 months, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment stopped by 1 year after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were 59.5% +/- 3.4% and 81.5% +/- 2.2%, respectively, at 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>5 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EFS rates by risk category were similar (60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2% +/- 6.0% for standard risk, 57.7% +/- 5.6% for high risk, and 62 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>5% +/- 5.7% for extremely high risk), whereas overall survival rates differed significantly (91.2% +/- 2.7%, 80.0% +/- 4.1%, and 72.1% +/- 4.5%, respectively, P &lt;.0001 by the log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 107 relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five (79.4%) of these 107 patients achieved second complete remissions, with subsequent EFS rates of 61.5% +/- 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>9% (standard risk), 42.6% +/- 8.1% (high risk), and 9.6% +/- 6.4% (extremely high risk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the five risk factors analyzed, only the response to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> monotherapy among extremely high-risk patients proved important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early treatment intensification did not compensate for a truncated phase of maintenance chemotherapy in children with standard- or high-risk ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, 6 months of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolite</z:chebi> treatment seemed adequate for extremely high-risk patients who were good responders to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and received intensified chemotherapy that included high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> early in the clinical course </plain></SENT>
