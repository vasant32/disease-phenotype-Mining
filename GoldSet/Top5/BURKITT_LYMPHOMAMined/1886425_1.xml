<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A female patient with precursor B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) was analyzed cytogenetically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Karyotyping of the leukemic cells showed a Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1), and also showed a translocation between 2p13 and 14q32, which is thought to be specific for children with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA analysis with both conventional and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed the rearrangement of the c-abl gene, the BCR gene outside the 5.8 kb breakpoint cluster region (bcr or M-BCR), and the comigration of an abnormal Not I pHabl 5' and 3'-bcr fragment, indicating the presence of BCR/c-abl recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The JH gene was rearranged, but the JK gene showed a germline configuration, as with previously reported cases with a t(2;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case is the first report of a patient with Ph1-positive precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, in whom a specific translocation t(2;14)(p13;q32) is found simultaneously </plain></SENT>
