<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Leukaemic cells are classified into these lines according to the expression of lineage specific differentiation markers, which are T-cell receptors, associated with CD3 antigenic complex, for the T-line and immunoglobulins for the B-line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> seem to be one type of disease, in the B-lineage it is possible to distinguish several types of diseases according to clinical findings and immunoglobulin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies directed against various surface antigens are used for diagnosis of ALL and their significance in various types of ALL is evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specificity of diagnostic markers is discussed especially from the point of the so called "mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath>", cells of which should differentiate in myeloid and lymphoid lines </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Present knowledge of karyotype findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> classified according to specific differentiation markers is reviewed and the necessity to introduce a complex classification on this basis is stressed </plain></SENT>
