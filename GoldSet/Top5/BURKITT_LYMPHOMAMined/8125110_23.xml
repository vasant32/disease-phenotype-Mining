<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In exponentially growing tissue culture cells, the beta subunit was synthesized in excess of the catalytic subunit (alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A substantial fraction of newly synthesized beta was degraded within the first hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining fraction of beta was incorporated into holoenzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, little degradation of newly synthesized alpha subunit was observed and most was quickly and efficiently incorporated into holoenzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The assembly of beta with alpha was paralleled by an increase in apparent molecular mass of beta due to phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subcellular distribution of newly synthesized [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]Met-labelled casein kinase II and of enzyme labelled and chased in the presence of excess unlabelled methionine was very similar and compatible with a nuclear localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degradation of the excess beta subunit occurred through a non-lysosomal proteolytic system with a very low ATP requirement </plain></SENT>
