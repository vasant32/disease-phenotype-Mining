<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: As ultrasound (US) has become more widely available in sub-Saharan Africa, emerging evidence suggests that the prevalence of abdominal disease in endemic Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (eBL) is higher than previous estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective chart review was designed to assess: (1) abdominal US utilisation, (2) the incidence of abdominal disease at diagnosis, (3) correlation of extent of disease at diagnosis with overall and event-free survival (EFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: The charts of 95 consecutive children with eBL diagnosed between April 2006 and 2008 and treated according to the Malawi 2002/03 protocol at the Banso Baptist Hospital in Cameroon were examined for demographics, clinical presentation, diagnostic workup and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, Z-tests and Student's t-tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty of 95 presumptive eBL patients (52.7%) had fine needle aspirate (FNA) confirmation of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four of 95 had an US at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>US was superior to clinical exam in demonstrating abdominal disease (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the rates of jaw (73%) and abdominal disease (82%) identified by US at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EFS among patients whose disease was upgraded by US (64%) was better that of the patients with clinically diagnosed stage 3 disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that US provides more accurate staging of eBL than clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Abdominal involvement is more common than previously reported and appears to be as frequent as disease of the jaw at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further study should determine if more accurate staging with US is useful in risk-stratifying treatment </plain></SENT>
