<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While several protocols allowed the amplification of a large proportion of these cells in vitro, the purity of the final preparation is usually <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> between different donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functional studies of this population are often controversial due to the presence of other populations such as NK cells which share a wide range of characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, the gamma9delta2 T cells labelled-fraction is purified and mixed with the irradiated unlabelled fraction followed by a single stimulation with phosphoantigen, in turn followed by a classical step of amplification in the presence of interleukin 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we describe a straightforward protocol to amplify pure populations of gamma9delta2 T cells which could be useful in fundamental research or in the development of a new generation of gammadelta cell therapy protocol </plain></SENT>
