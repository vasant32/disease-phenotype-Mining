<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latent membrane protein (LMP) gene, the EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs) 1 and 2, and the origin of replication genes of the virus are the principal <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> effectors of transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the cellular proteins that enhances the growth and proliferation of B cells is lymphotoxin (LT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have found that Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells containing a strain of EBV with a deletion in EBNA-2 had lower constitutive and inducible levels of LT compared to LT production in Burkitt's cells with competent EBV or lymphoblastoid cell lines actively producing EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, the LT production in the latter cell lines was greater than in cells in which the infecting EBV had a deletion in the LMP gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative decrease in LT production associated with deletions in the LMP was less than that found with EBNA-2 deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall our results indicate that the EBNA-2 gene enhances the capacity of EBV-infected cells to produce LT </plain></SENT>
