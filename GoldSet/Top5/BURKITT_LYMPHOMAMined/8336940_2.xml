<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In many differentiating cells, a reduction of c-myc proto-oncogene expression is a prerequisite for terminal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The downmodulation of c-myc in differentiating cells is due to at least two different mechanisms: (i) an elongation block to c-myc transcription activated during an early phase of differentiation and (ii) an inhibition of transcription initiation activated during a later phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to determine cis-acting target structures of the c-myc gene required for the late-phase downregulation of transcriptional initiation, we permanently transfected U937 cells with constructs containing the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> transferase (CAT) gene driven by a 2.8 kb c-myc promoter region or deletions thereof </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined two distinct domains in the c-myc promoter region both of which are essential for efficient terminal downregulation: a proximal domain and a distal domain which are located between base pairs -606 to -101, and between -2392 to -1396, respectively, relative to P1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The identification of two distinct regulatory elements suggests the requirement and cooperation of two regulatory factors as an essential event for mediating differentiation-induced downregulation of c-myc in monocytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The implications of these results for deregulation of the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
