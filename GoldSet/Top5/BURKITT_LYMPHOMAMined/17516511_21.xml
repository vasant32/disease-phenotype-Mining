<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The proteasome is the main protease for extralysosomal protein degradation in eukaryotic cells, and constitutes a sophisticated high molecular mass proteinase complex underlying a tightly coordinated expression and assembly of multiple subunits and subcomplexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that continuous inhibition of proteasomal chymotrypsin-like peptidase activity by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> induces in human Namalwa Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells increased de novo biogenesis of proteasomes accompanied by increased expression of the proteasome maturation protein POMP, increased expression of 19S-20S-19S proteasomes, and abrogation of expression of beta 1i, beta 2i and beta 5i immunosubunits and PA28 in favor of increased expression of constitutive proteolytic beta1, beta2 and beta 5 subunits and 19S regulatory complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These alterations of proteasome expression and subunit composition are accompanied by an increase in proteasomal caspase-like, trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like peptidase activities, not inhibitable by high doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells harboring these proteasomal alterations display rapid proliferation and cell cycle progression, and acquire resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitors</z:chebi>, gamma-irradiation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This acquired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> resistance is accompanied by de novo expression of anti-apoptotic Hsp27 protein and the loss of ability to accumulate and stabilize pro-apoptotic p53 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, increased expression, altered subunit composition and increased activity of proteasomes constitute a hitherto unknown adaptive and autoregulatory feedback mechanism to allow cells to survive the lethal challenge of proteasome inhibition and to establish a hyperproliferative and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-resistant phenotype </plain></SENT>
