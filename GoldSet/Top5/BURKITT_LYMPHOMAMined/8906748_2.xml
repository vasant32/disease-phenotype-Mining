<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of the cells with anti-IgG antibody induced a marked and synchronous replication of EBV DNA within 12 hr, before the cells entered into S-phase after release from DMSO-induced arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a reduced efficiency of productive replication was demonstrated if anti-IgG stimulation was delayed after release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that entry into S-phase of host cells is not only unnecessary for, but also may have negative consequences for the productive phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, it was shown that addition of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of the EBV-encoded DNA polymerase, to anti-IgG-stimulated Akata cells inhibited the productive replication of EBV DNA, but had no effect on the expression of early genes of the virus, including BZLF1, BRLF1, BMRF1, and BHRF1 </plain></SENT>
