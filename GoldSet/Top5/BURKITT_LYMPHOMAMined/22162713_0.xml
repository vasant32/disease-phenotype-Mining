<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>While the defects in HLA class I-mediated Ag presentation by Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) have been well documented, CD4+ T-cells are also poorly stimulated by HLA class II Ag presentation, and the reasons underlying this defect(s) have not yet been fully resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells are deficient in their ability to optimally stimulate CD4+ T cells via the HLA class II pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The observed defect was not associated with low levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-expressed costimulatory molecules, as addition of external co-stimulation failed to result in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-mediated CD4+ T-cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells express the components of the class II pathway, and the defect was not caused by faulty Ag/class II interaction, because antigenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> bound with measurable affinity to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-associated class II molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> with broystatin-1, a potent modulator of protein kinase C, led to significant improvement of functional class II Ag presentation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The restoration of immune recognition appeared to be linked with an increased expression of a 17 kDa peptidylprolyl-like protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the presence of a specific defect in HLA class II-mediated Ag presentation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and reveal that treatment with bryostatin-1 could lead to enhanced immunogenicity </plain></SENT>
