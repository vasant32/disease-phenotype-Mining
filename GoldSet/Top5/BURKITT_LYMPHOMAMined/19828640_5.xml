<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human positive regulatory domain I-binding factor 1 (PRDI-BF1) and its murine homolog Blimp-1 promote differentiation of mature B cells into Ab-secreting plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ectopic expression of PRDI-BF1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells can lead to inhibition of proliferation or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is currently known about the regulation of PRDM1, the gene encoding PRDI-BF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This report establishes that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells stimulation through the BCR rapidly induces endogenous PRDM1 at the level of transcription with minor changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The induced PRDM1-encoded protein localizes to its target genes in vivo and suppresses their expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo genomic footprinting of the PRDM1 promoter in unstimulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells reveals multiple common in vivo occupied elements throughout the promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further functional and structural analysis of the promoter reveals that the promoter is preloaded and poised for activation in the B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The transcription factor PU.1 is shown to be required for the BCR-induced expression of PRDM1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and in PU.1-positive <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activation of PRDM1 is associated with loss of the corepressor transducin-like enhancer of split 4 from the PU.1 complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that PRDM1 is poised for activation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and therefore may be a potential therapeutic target to inhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell proliferation and survival </plain></SENT>
