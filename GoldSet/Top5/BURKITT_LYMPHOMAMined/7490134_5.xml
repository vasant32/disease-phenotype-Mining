<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Analysis of complement inhibitory proteins present on the surface of Raji cells (obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures; originally established from human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) revealed two populations of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These populations differed in their expression of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored inhibitors CD59 and decay-accelerating factor (DAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two stable clones were established by limiting dilution of the original cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Raji+3 expressed CD59 and DAF whereas Raji-26 expressed neither inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both clones expressed membrane cofactor protein (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses of other cell surface proteins (CD19, CD35, CD48 and CD58 (transmembrane form)) revealed similar levels of expression of transmembrane proteins by both clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, CD48 was expressed only by Raji+3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As CD48, DAF and CD59 are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> GPI-anchored molecules it is likely that a defect in the GPI-anchoring mechanism is responsible for the generation of the second population of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two clones demonstrated markedly different sensitivities to complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When equally sensitized cells from both clones were treated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human serum (12.5%) for 1 hr at 37 degrees, the Raji+3 clone was resistant to complement-mediated lysis, whereas approximately 70% of the Raji-26 cells were lysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, by using specific antibody to block the function of membrane-bound complement inhibitors, lysis of Raji+3 was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whilst blocking of one inhibitor only on the cell had little effect on cell killing, blocking of two or more inhibitors significantly increased cell lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three inhibitors expressed by these cells contributed to protection against classical pathway-mediated complement activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, whilst a limited protective role was seen for <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>, CD59 and DAF appeared to be of far more importance for protection from complement-mediated lysis via the classical pathway </plain></SENT>
