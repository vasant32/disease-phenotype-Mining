<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In IFN-sensitive Daudi cells derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, IFNs produce dose-dependent hyperpolarization, decreased plasma membrane viscosity, modulation of the microfilament system, and altered synthesis of cAMP, cGMP and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No such changes were seen in IFN alpha-resistant Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>, pentoxifylline, or the cGMP inducer <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40910">azide</z:chebi> (NaN3) had no significant effect on the IFN alpha induced membrane potential changes, or on membrane viscosity changes as measured by flow cytometry and electron spin resonance spectrometry </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measurement of early biophysical changes induced by IFNs may represent a new screening method to rapidly explore certain types of IFN alpha potentiating agents </plain></SENT>
