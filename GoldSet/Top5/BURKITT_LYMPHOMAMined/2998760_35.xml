<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To help elucidate the mechanism of regulation of the c-myc gene we have characterised the DNase I hypersensitive sites around this gene in the human promyelocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> cell line HL60, which carries amplified c-myc, and in Ramos, a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line with a translocation close to exon 1 of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although dividing HL60 cells display a pattern of DNase I hypersensitive sites which is similar to that of previously described c-myc genes in B cells (lymphoblastoid and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), changes were found in DNase I hypersensitive sites upon differentiation of the HL60 cell line (accompanied by decreased c-myc transcription) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lack of c-myc transcription coincides with the loss of several DNase I hypersensitive sites and the reduction in intensity of a further site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern was also seen in the inactive allele of the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Ramos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A striking feature of both differentiated HL60 cells and of the inactive allele in Ramos is the quantitative maintenance of a DNase I hypersensitive site which occurs approximately 2.5 kb upstream of the c-myc gene promoters </plain></SENT>
