<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a study of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> maintained in culture for periods up to two years, the following observations were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most prominent cell type in serially cultured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>osteosarcomas</z:hpo> was fibroblastic in appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 16-20 wk in culture some lines spontaneously developed foci of altered cells resembling the foci produced in monolayer cultures by oncogenic viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of these foci in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> cultures was transient, and usually they did not reappear; but in one instance they recurred with a characteristic periodicity of several weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From one of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> lines, in which foci appeared after 5 months in culture, two subcultures were established from stored frozen cells and these both exhibited foci after approximately the same lapse of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same phenomenon has been seen with another line, suggesting that the time of appearance of foci is characteristic for particular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Foci of similar type could sometimes be induced in monolayer cultures of human fibroblasts by filtered medium from cultured <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo>; this bore no relation to the presence or absence of foci in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> cultures at the time the filtrate was prepared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy of the spontaneous and induced foci, and of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> cultures, revealed no demonstrable virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>12 out of 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> cultures contained an antigen (S) demonstrable by indirect immunofluorescence with human sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was not present in any of the original <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> specimens, nor in any culture lines other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At least 3-4 wk in culture appear to be required for its demonstration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The antigen was cytoplasmic, occurred in only a small proportion of the cells, and was unpredictably variable in its expression, even in the same culture line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It could be induced in monolayer cultures of human fibroblasts by filtrates of medium from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As with the foci, the induction of S antigen in indicator cultures was not dependent upon the expression of antigen in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> line from which the filtrates were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no association between the presence of foci and of antigen, nor was there any apparent relation between the ability of filtrates to induce foci and their ability to induce antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>80% or more of the general population have S antibody, and the titer of antibody in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> is no higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Thus, as in the case of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> antigen, it appears that most individuals have been exposed to S antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>But unlike Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, no relation has so far been established between any particular disease and a corresponding high titer or frequency of occurrence of S antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of foci of altered cells and of a common antigen, and the transmission of these two characters to indicator cells by filtrates, are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suggestive of a virus specifically associated with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo>, one to which the general population is widely exposed, as indicated by the prevalence of antibody </plain></SENT>
