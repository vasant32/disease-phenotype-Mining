<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We asked whether binding of human immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody reacting with Raji cells could be distinguished from binding of IgG immune complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a standard Raji assay employing 125I-IgG goat anti-human Fc gamma, we found that digestion of Raji cells with pronase reduced by 95% their ability to bind complement-fixed aggregated human gamma globulin and complement-fixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> toxoid-antitetanus toxin complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, binding at 37 degrees C of IgG from the sera of 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) to pronase-digested Raji cells was reduced much less consistently and extensively (9-100% reduction; mean reduction of 51%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In more detailed studies of two SLE sera, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> density gradient centrifugation showed that greater than 50% of the IgG binding to undigested Raji cells sedimented in the 7S region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pepsin digestion of immunoglobulin fractions from four SLE sera caused a reduction in SLE IgG binding to undigested Raji cells when detected with 125I anti-Fc gamma, but an increase when binding was detected with 125I-anti-Fab, suggesting that substantial SLE IgG can bind through F(ab')2 regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binding of IgG from SLE sera was not directed at neoantigenic sites induced by pronase digestion because binding activity was adsorbed with undigested cells as readily as with digested cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, sera from 10 SLE patients that had negative Raji assays contained no IgG that bound to pronase-digested Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that much of the IgG bound at 37 degrees C to Raji cells from the sera of many patients with SLE does not represent immune complexes but is probably antibody directed toward sites on the Raji cell </plain></SENT>
