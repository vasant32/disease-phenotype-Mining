<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A clone of Daudi cells (Daudi-S) synthesizes the heavy chain of IgM (mu-chain) under routine conditions of cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the presence of alpha-interferon, however, synthesis of mu-chain is decreased rapidly at a time when the overall protein synthesis is not modified and the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase and the 2-5A synthetase are induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This inhibition of mu-chain synthesis seems to be correlated with the antiproliferative action of interferon since it occurs only slightly in another clone of Daudi cells resistant (Daudi-R) to the antiproliferative action of interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these resistant cells, however, the protein kinase and the 2-5A synthetase are induced by interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specific inhibition of mu-chain synthesis in interferon-treated Daudi-S cells is a consequence of decreased steady-state levels of mu-chain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect occurs 4-8 h after addition of interferon in parallel with decreased levels of c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and enhanced levels of HLA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduced levels of mu-chain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in interferon-treated Daudi-S cells is not a consequence of its enhanced degradation as shown by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> chase experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, nuclear run on experiments rule out an effect on the transcription of mu-chain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the inhibitory mechanism mediated by interferon might be at the level of termination and/or post-transcriptional processing of mu-chain <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in these same interferon-treated Daudi-S cells, the inhibition of c-myc gene expression is due to an enhanced degradation of its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (in accord with other reports) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that interferon can inhibit gene expression by different mechanisms </plain></SENT>
