<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Commonly, it is treated in the clinical trials for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, of which it represents the leukemic counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> diagnosed between 1988 and 1999 were enrolled in the AIEOP-8805 protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment included six high-dose chemotherapy courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No prophylactic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> irradiation was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-five consecutive patients were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>L3 <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was observed in 57 of 65 patients (88%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five children (38%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass in addition to massive bone marrow infiltration; 11 children (17%) had <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two patients obtained complete morphological remission of which 13 suffered a relapse, including 3 with initial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten-year overall survival and event-free survival were 77% and 75%, respectively </plain></SENT>
