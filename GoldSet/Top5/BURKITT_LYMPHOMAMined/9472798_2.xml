<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the influence of selective T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of allogeneic PBPC grafts on graft-vs.-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (GVL) activity and investigated the effectiveness of ex vivo treatment with NK cell-activating cytokines to compensate for the putative loss of T cell-derived factors stimulating natural cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After pretreatment of Balb/c (H-2d) recipients with 7.5 Gy of total body irradiation, 2x10(7) rhG-CSF-mobilized PBPCs of splenectomized syngeneic or MHC-identical <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> (H-2d) mice were transferred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selective T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> (TCD) was performed by immunomagnetic purging with a mononoclonal antibody directed against CD3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some experimental groups, T cell-depleted PBPCs were incubated with 200 U/mL interleukin (IL)-2 and 100 U/mL IL-12 for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate antileukemic activity in vivo, recipient mice were inoculated with 1x10(5) A20 cells (a B-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> of Balb/c origin) 2 days before PBPC transplantation (PBPCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After transplantation of unmanipulated allogeneic cells, 25% of the animals died with signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs.-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) but 71% were free from relapse 100 days after PBPCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After TCD of allogeneic grafts with anti-CD3, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e>-related mortality was below 5% but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival rate was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased to 25% and thus was similar to that observed after syngeneic PBPCT (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When CD3-depleted grafts were incubated with IL-2 and IL-12, 45% of the animals remained free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>; however, the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that ex vivo activation of residual NK cells with IL-2 and IL-12 does not fully compensate for the abrogation of GVL activity after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CD3+ T cells from MHC-matched PBPCT </plain></SENT>
