<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To prove this point, [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]methionine-labelled, microsomal membrane proteins or immunoprecipitates of such detergent-solubilized proteins were subjected to electrophoresis either in <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> gels or in two-dimensional, nonequilibrium pH gradient gels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The induced p35 molecule was judged to be Ii by molecular weight and isoelectric characteristics and by immune complex associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The abundant expression of Ii on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>-treated P3HR-1 cells mimicked the high level of expression of p35 or Ii on leukemic cells of a subset of patients with hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alpha and beta chains of the HLA-D complex were absent from the P3HR-1 cell line and present in the Jijoye parent from which mutant P3HR-1 was derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This relatively simple model can lead to the study of inducible synthesis, processing and expression of Ii, with or without HLA-D alpha and beta chains </plain></SENT>
