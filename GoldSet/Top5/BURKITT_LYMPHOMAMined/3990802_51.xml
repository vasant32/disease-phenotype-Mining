<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of murine chromosome 15 in T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> suggests that it bears one or more genes conducive to T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One such gene seems to be c-myc, the oncogene frequently activated in B-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598798" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoid tumours</z:e> either by retroviral insertion, as in the avian bursal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, or by a translocation to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus, as in the predominant t(12; 15) of murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> and the analogous t(14; 8) of human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The c-myc gene was strongly implicated in T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> when 15-25% of T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> arising in AKR mice, a strain prone to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, were found to have retroviral inserts near c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proviruses near c-myc were also found in several T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> induced by murine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> viruses (MuLV) in both mice and rats, but many of the rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymomas</z:hpo> bear an insert instead at one of several other common sites, at least two of which have murine homologues on chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show here that some murine T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> contain proviral inserts in the recently identified chromosome 15 locus for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> variant (6; 15) translocations, which we have denoted pvt-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although 6; 15 breakpoints map cytogenetically to the same chromosome band as c-myc, the alterations of pvt-1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> occur at least 72 kilobases (kb) from the c-myc promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The insertions in T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> suggest that an altered pvt-1 locus is conducive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in T cells as well as B cells, possibly via long-range effects on c-myc expression </plain></SENT>
