<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although these translocations are thought to lead to a deregulation of c-myc expression, the structural and functional basis of this phenomenon has not been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in a specific region spanning approximately 70 base pairs and located at the 3' border of the first exon of translocated c-myc alleles were consistently detected in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells carrying classic (8:14) as well as variant (8:22 and 2:8) translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These structural alterations were accompanied by an altered pattern of c-myc transcription, namely, the removal of a block to transcriptional elongation that has been mapped to the same region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, specific c-myc mutations leading to the alleviation of this block to transcriptional elongation may represent a general mechanism causing c-myc activation in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
