<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to isolate mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) recognizing <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc (Pk, CD77), which has been described as a Burkitt's-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three IgGI MAbs reactive with Pk were developed using a synthetic glycoconjugate as immunogen and a filter immunoplaque screening assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One MAb (PK67) was characterized by immuno-thin-layer chromatography, ELISA and competition assays using neutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> from various sources and a variety of carbohydrates and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">Epitope</z:chebi> analysis showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 carbohydrates moieties are required in PK67 binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No cross-reactivity was observed with closely related carbohydrate structures, with the exception of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the reactivity with this structure was several orders of magnitude lower than with Pk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of fresh-frozen tissue specimens showed that Gb3 is widely expressed: prominent staining was observed in many <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, e.g., kidney and gastric tissue and on capillary endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In lymph nodes, very weak staining of a few B cells was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis of hematopoietic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> showed Gb3 expression on B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, particularly those with committed B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> indicating that, in addition to earlier reports of Gb3 expression on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Gb3 is present on other committed B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
