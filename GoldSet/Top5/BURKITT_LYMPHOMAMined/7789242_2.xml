<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The American form of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> which usually involves the abdomen in children and young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is only a limited literature which describes the cytologic features of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in serous effusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present three children with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> initially diagnosed by effusion cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first patient, an 11-yr-old boy, presented with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusions</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo>, and abdominal masses and had diagnostic pleural fluid cytology without tissue confirmation (ultrastructural examination was performed on the effusion specimen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He died 7 months after the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second patient, a 9-yr-old boy, presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> and abdominal masses and had diagnostic peritoneal fluid cytology with a subsequent confirmatory chest wall biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third patient, a 16-yr-old girl, presented with a 2-month history of irregular menses, a large pelvic mass, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, and liver masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although an ovarian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was clinically suspected, cytologic examination of her peritoneal fluid revealed Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical exploration revealed involvement of her right ovary, cecum, and terminal ileum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The second and third patients are currently alive with no apparent disease following chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients, effusion cytology revealed Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, characterized by a uniform population of non-cohesive lymphoid cells with noncleaved nuclei, prominent multiple nucleoli, and scanty-to-moderate basophilic cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic and/or nuclear vacuoles were also seen, more prominent in Diff-Quik-stained, air-dried smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These cases demonstrate the importance of recognizing the cytologic features of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, as serous fluid may be the initial diagnostic specimen </plain></SENT>
