<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>250 microM for P3.HR-1 and RPMI 1788 cell lines and 30.5 +/- 6.5 microM for the Jijoye cell line; the Km values for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> were higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Determination of intracellular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> concentration showed that this might limit the rate of O2.- production since in each cell line it was at or below the Km concentration </plain></SENT>
