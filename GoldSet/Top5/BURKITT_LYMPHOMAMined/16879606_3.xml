<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From September 1997 to August 2005, 55 untreated patients (age less than 20 yr) from a single institution were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were stratified by risk factors (stage, LDH level and chemotherapy response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with a modified B-NHL-BFM 90 protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 8 yr (range 1.5-20 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 22 (40%) had Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (BKL), 22 (40%) had diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLBL) and 11 (20%) had anaplastic large T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) occurred in 45 patients (83%), partial remission (PR) in eight patients (14.5%), and progressive disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) in one patient (1.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At a median follow up of 24 months, the event free survival (EFS) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 85% +/- 5% with 100% for group R1, 84% +/- 7% for group R2 and 72% +/- 13% for group R3, and most notably, 80% +/- 6% for stage III/IV at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.96) in EFS among BKL and DLBL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The major toxicity complications were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> and mucositis, but these conditions were tolerated and manageable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This modified NHL-BFM-90 protocol is very effective for Chinese children and adolescents with BKL and large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and represented an increase in the cure rates in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220612" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood NHL</z:e> in China </plain></SENT>
