<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: lyn is one of the src family genes encoding protein-tyrosine kinases, expressed preferentially in B lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its gene product, Lyn protein, is thought to participate in cell membrane-associated signal transduction on B lymphocytes by associating physically and functionally with membrane-bound IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To investigate the expression of Lyn on human malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (MLs), 50 ML biopsies, 12 ML samples maintained in mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo>, and 4 African Burkitt type cell lines were studied with the use of immunohistology, immunochemistry, and Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among biopsy specimens, 27 of 27 B-MLs, 5 of 21 T-MLs, and 2 of 2 null-MLs were stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> mouse-maintained B-MLs, unlike biopsied B-MLs, 4 of 11 were found to be unstained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further analysis disclosed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 of these unstained B-MLs were the Epstein Barr virus transformed B cells proliferating in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> mice and not the original ML cells, suggesting the presence of a specific mechanism down-regulating the Lyn protein in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One IgA+ IgM- B-ML and one IgG+ IgM- B-ML were stained by the antibody, indicating the possible existence of molecular mechanisms other than membrane-bound IgM that facilitate Lyn protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decrease of Lyn expression was also noted in 3 of 4 Epstein-Barr virus-positive African Burkitt's ML lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complementary Western blot analysis of 8 immunostained and 4 unstained MLs confirmed the immunohistologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However Southern blot analysis showed that the lyn gene in Lyn-positive and -negative cases were apparently unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The level of Lyn expression in MLs reflects mainly their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterpart, whereas it can be expressed somewhat differently in some cases, especially in Epstein Barr virus-transformed MLs that occur in immunocompromised hosts, on which it is often down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of Lyn expression on human MLs </plain></SENT>
