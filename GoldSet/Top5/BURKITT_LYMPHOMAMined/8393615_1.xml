<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pattern of growth more closely resembled that of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells than that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other lymphoblastoid cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the rapidly growing lymphoblastoid cell line showed two distinctive changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cells derived from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> had a 1:18 chromosomal translocation [t(1;18)(p32.1;q23.3)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, the lymphoblastoid cell line down-regulated expression of lymphocyte function associated antigen-1a during passage in severe combined immunodeficient mice, but regained expression upon growth in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These two changes seem sufficient to explain the enhanced tumorigenicity of this cell line and may represent examples of changes that lead to more aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in posttransplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
