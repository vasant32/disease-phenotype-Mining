<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Freshly harvested cells were mechanically disrupted and separated into the nuclear, cell-membrane and cell-sap fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nearly 90 per cent of the total beta2-microglobulin was recovered in the cell-membrane and cell-sap fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cell-membrane fraction contained 75-88 per cent of the beta2-microglobulin recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rest was in the cell-sap fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most, 84-91 per cent, of the beta2-microglobulin in the cell-membrane fraction was present combined with membrane fraction was present combined with membrane components of about 38,000 daltons that carried the xenoantigenic activity characteristic of the HLA large component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These membrane components did carry HLA alloantigenic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No other membrane components were involved in binding beta2-microglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The beta2-microglobulin in the cell-sap fraction was present in the unbound state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the cell lines examined, the membrane component which was combined with beta2-microglobulin appeared to be exclusively the HLA large component and no larg excess of beta2-microglobulin over the HLA large component was found </plain></SENT>
