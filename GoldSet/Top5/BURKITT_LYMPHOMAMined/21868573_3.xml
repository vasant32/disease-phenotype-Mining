<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The interactions between proapoptotic and pro-survival proteins of the Bcl-2 family are critical for this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we show that expression of the proapoptotic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30153">BH3</z:chebi>-only Bcl-2 family member Puma was selectively up-regulated on in vitro activation with antigens or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> of both human and mouse B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Puma expression coincided in vivo, with the prosurvival Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 within the germinal centers and its expression correlates with the germinal center like phenotype of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiments performed in Puma-deficient mice revealed that Puma is essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated B cells in vitro and for the control of memory B-cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, using both human and murine models, our data show that Puma has a major role in the T cell- dependent B-cell immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that Puma is a major regulator of memory B lymphocyte survival and therefore a key molecule in the control of the immune response </plain></SENT>
