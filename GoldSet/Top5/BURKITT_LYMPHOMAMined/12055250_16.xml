<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transfer of target cell-derived Ags together with proximal molecules onto the effector cell appears also to occur through synapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the molecular basis of this transfer, but it is assumed to result from Ag receptor internalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because human gamma delta T cells recognize soluble nonpeptidic phosphoantigens as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells such as Daudi, it is unknown whether they establish IS with, and extract molecules from, target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, we show in this work that Ag-stimulated human V gamma 9/V delta 2 T cells conjugate to, and perform molecular transfer from, various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The molecular transfer appears to be linked to IS establishment, evolves in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of either soluble or cellular Ag, and requires gamma delta TCR ligation, Src family kinase signaling, and participation of the actin cytoskeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although CD45 exclusion characterized the IS performed by gamma delta T cells, no obvious capping of the gamma delta TCR was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The synaptic transfer mediated by gamma delta T cells involved target molecules unrelated to the cognate Ag and occurred independently of MHC class I expression by target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From these observations, we conclude that despite the particular features of gamma delta T cell activation, both synapse formation and molecular transfer of determinants belonging to target cell characterize gamma delta T cell recognition of Ags </plain></SENT>
