<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The incidence of primary central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (PCNSLs) has increased over the past several decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, even with the most effective therapeutic regimen (that is, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> with wholebrain radiation therapy), PCNSL recurs within a few years in more than half of the treated patients and is eventually fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because PCNSL usually occurs in older patients and in those with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome, combination treatments in which both chemo- and radiation therapy are used is often poorly tolerated and results in a significant reduction in the quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been demonstrated that the selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50629">cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> (Celebrex), can block the growth of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To create an experimental animal model in vivo for the PCNSL study, the authors intracranially injected a human B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line into <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their data demonstrate that this experimental model is an excellent one for human PCNSL with brain and leptomeningeal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They also evaluated the feasibility of using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of PCNSL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>Nude</z:mp> mice with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> contained in the animal chow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treated animals demonstrated significantly prolonged survival times compared with the untreated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on the authors' data, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of PCNSL </plain></SENT>
