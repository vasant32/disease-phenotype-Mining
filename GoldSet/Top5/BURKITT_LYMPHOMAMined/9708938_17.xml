<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involving the prostate is rare, and to the authors' knowledge the factors determining patient outcome have not been studied in a large series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors evaluated the clinical and pathologic findings in 60 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 2 cases of Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involving the prostate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A variety of clinical and histologic findings were considered as factors predictive of patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> tended to occur in elderly men, with a mean age at diagnosis of 62 years (range, 5-89 years), although 6 patients were age &lt; 40 years (ages 5, 19, 30, 32, 38, and 38 years, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical signs and symptoms were due to lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178879" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">urinary tract obstruction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (35%) presented with primary extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the prostate with a variety of histologic subtypes, including small lymphocytic (4 patients); follicular center cell, diffuse, small cell (2 patients); follicular center cell, Grade 1 (according to the revised European-American classification (small cleaved) (1 patient); Grade 2 (mixed) (1 patient); diffuse large B-cell (12 patients); and high grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt-like (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the time of presentation, none of these patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo>, inguinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, or an abnormal complete blood count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty other patients (48%) with previously documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at other sites developed prostatic involvement; these secondary prostatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> displayed a variety of subtypes, including small lymphocytic (8 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>); follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse, small cell (2 patients); follicular center, Grade 1 (small cell) (1 patient); follicular center, Grade 2 (1 patient); diffuse large B-cell (11 patients); peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (2 patients); high grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt-like (1 patient); Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1 patient); Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (nodular sclerosing [1 patient] and mixed cellularity [1 patient]); and unknown (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten cases were not classifiable as primary or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients died of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 14 died of unknown or other causes, 18 patients were alive 12-20 months after diagnosis (8 primary and 10 secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>; 3 had persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated since 1981), and 5 were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> specific survival was 64% at 1 year (95% confidence interval [CI], 51-80%), 50% at 2 years (95% CI, 36-68%), 33% at 5 years, 33% at 10 years, and 16% at 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in median survival after diagnosis of prostatic involvement between primary and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (23 months vs. 28 months, respectively) or among histologic types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involving the prostate is rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178879" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">urinary tract obstruction</z:e>, particularly in patients with a previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
