<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the modulation of apoptotic signals during lytic cycle remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show here that resulting from <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> reactivation in the EBV-positive Mutu-I and Akata Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, a two steps proteasome-dependent downregulation of expression of the proapoptotic protein BimEL occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first drop might be EBV-independent, is ERK 1/2 dependent, and BimEL is phosphorylated on Ser69 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second dramatic drop of the BimEL level observed during the lytic cycle is dependent of EBV-late-gene expression, ERK 1/2 independent, and no further phosphorylation of BimEL on Ser69 occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate for the first time, that the lytic cycle contributes to downregulation of BimEL and then could add to protection against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
