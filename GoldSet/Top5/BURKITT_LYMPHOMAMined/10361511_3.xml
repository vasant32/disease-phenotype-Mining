<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis is critical in diagnosis and classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and has been used after therapy to monitor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell precursors, hematogones, particularly in the context of treated pediatric B-cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (BP-ALL), may confound such evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the value of more specific genotypic markers (polymerase chain reaction evaluation of 2 antigen receptor genes) was assessed to resolve this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis of enriched mononuclear cells revealed 1% to 20% precursor B cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBCs</z:e>), based on expression of 1 or more pan-B cell antigens in addition to CD10, CD34, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inasmuch as this mimicked the immunophenotype of the original leukemic clone, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBCs</z:e>, in isolation, were considered suspicious for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 11 of the 14 posttherapy specimens (79%) revealed no monoclonally rearranged antigen receptor genes, and 7 of these 11 patients had trackable genotypic markers at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, by PCR these 7 patients had complete molecular remission, supported by clinical follow up of 16 to 73 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the remaining 4 patients with PCR-negative disease, 3 continue in remission, confirming the interpretation of false-positive flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, flow cytometric monitoring of posttherapy bone marrow specimens from patients with BP-ALL may be misleading, if considered in isolation, in falsely suggesting the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rather, PCR for antigen receptor gene rearrangements is a valuable and specific tool, helpful in differentiating hematogones from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in patients with treated BP-ALL whose bone marrow harbors increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
