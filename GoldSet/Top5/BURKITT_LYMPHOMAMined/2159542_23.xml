<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The terminal proteins TP1 and TP2 are putative products of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genes expressed during the latent cycle of the virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are predicted to code for 53- and 40-kilodalton integral membrane proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus as an expression vector to produce TP1 in large amounts in insect cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DNA sequences used to express TP1 originated from a TP1 cDNA derived from an M-<z:chebi fb="81" ids="2365,53554">ABA</z:chebi>/CBL1 cDNA library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rabbit antisera raised against procaryotic TP1 fusion proteins recognized a monomer and a dimer of the recombinant TP1 protein in the infected insect cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence studies of living insect cells showed that the recombinant protein is located in the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The insect cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus producing TP1 provided a test system to screen human antisera for TP1 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 168 human EBV-positive and EBV-negative antisera were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TP1 antibodies were detected only in sera from nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients (16 out of 42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rabbit antiserum raised against the recombinant TP1 protein expressed in the baculovirus system specifically recognized a protein of about 54 kilodaltons in the lymphoblastoid cell lines M-<z:chebi fb="81" ids="2365,53554">ABA</z:chebi> and M-<z:chebi fb="81" ids="2365,53554">ABA</z:chebi>/CBL1 and in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines BL18 and BL72 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This protein could be located in the total membrane fraction of M-<z:chebi fb="81" ids="2365,53554">ABA</z:chebi> cells and is upregulated by treating the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
