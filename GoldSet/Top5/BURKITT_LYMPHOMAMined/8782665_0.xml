<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Terminal differentiation of hematopoietic cells in vivo and in vitro is almost invariably accompanied by down-regulated expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Constitutive expression of c-myc in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells inhibits terminal differentiation and maintains proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, chromosomal translocations cause a deregulation of the c-myc gene through fusion of this locus with one of the immunoglobulin gene loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the down-regulation of c-myc by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30772">n-butyric acid</z:chebi>, a potent inducer of differentiation, is also observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike other inducers of differentiation such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethylsulfoxide</z:chebi> or hexamethylenebisacetamide, which down-regulate c-myc expression, albeit transiently, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30772">n-butyric acid</z:chebi> causes a continuous, transcriptional shut-off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of the possible therapeutic implication of this finding, we have assayed structural analogues of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30772">n-butyric acid</z:chebi> for their effect on c-myc expression in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the analogues tested, 12 were active and 5 were inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only unbranched fatty acids with 4 and 5 carbon atoms showed activity, a 4-carbon chain being optimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3-chloropropionic acid had maximal activity at a 3-fold lower concentration than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30772">n-butyric acid</z:chebi> (1 mM versus 3 mM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The corresponding <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi>-analogues were equally effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Those analogues found capable of down-regulating c-myc in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were similarly effective in their ability to induce terminal differentiation in murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
