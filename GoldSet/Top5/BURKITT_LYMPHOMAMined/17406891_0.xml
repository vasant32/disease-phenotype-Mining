<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rearrangements lead to the joining of an IG gene with a (proto)oncogene, whereby the latter comes under the influence of transcription-stimulating sequences in the constitutively active IG locus resulting in deregulation of the oncogene and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present here three cases of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> that showed a t(14;19)(q32;p13) by karyotypic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detailed molecular cytogenetic characterization of the breakpoints on chromosomes 14 and 19 in the two cases from which extra material was available, demonstrated the involvement of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IGH@)-variable region on chromosome 14 in both and, in one case, that the breakpoint was within the BRD4 gene on chromosome 19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Against the background of what one knows about IGH@ involvement in lymphatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, it is difficult to envisage a fusion gene with qualitatively altered protein product as the crucial pathogenetic outcome of the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In spite of the fact that we found BRD4 split by the t(14;19)(q32;p13) in one of the two informative cases, we cannot be sure that this was the pathogenetically relevant target gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other pathogenetic possibilities could be deregulation of the neighboring NOTCH3 and/or ABHD9 genes, located distal to BRD4 in 19p13 </plain></SENT>
