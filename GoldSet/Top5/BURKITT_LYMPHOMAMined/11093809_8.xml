<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the expression of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-regulated subunits and the enzymatic activity of proteasomes purified from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-derived and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes representing different stages of B-cell activation/differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The catalytic beta subunits (Lmp2 and Lmp7) and the regulatory subunits (PA28alpha and PA28beta) were expressed at equally high levels in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), freshly isolated B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD23(-) B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lmp2 and Lmp7 were selectively down-regulated in germinal center cell-derived Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a direct correlation between the expression of Lmp2/7 and the chymotrypsin and trypsin-like activities in proteasomes purified from LCLs, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> and CLL cells, whereas 5 HD cell lines expressing B or T-cell markers exhibited a variable pattern of subunit expression and enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Poor hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrates by proteasomes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells correlated with a distinct pattern of cleavage of a reference 50mer <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, production of different sets of degradation products and significantly reduced recovery of a known cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The enzymatic activity of proteasomes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD23(-) "resting" B lymphocytes resembled that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells in spite of high Lmp2/7 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This pattern was not reversed by treatment with the B-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that different stages of B-cell activation/differentiation are associated with distinct profiles of IFN-gamma-regulated subunit composition and enzymatic activity of the proteasome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This may have important implications for the analysis and manipulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific immune responses </plain></SENT>
