<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates whether protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity and tyrosine phosphorylation on p95(vav) and on the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) play a role in the regulation of Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PTK inhibitor herbimycin A (HA) triggers significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> prior to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> from the G1-phase of the cell cycle, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of key proteins is critical for Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell cycle progression and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, signals transduced through CD40 fail to rescue Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells from HA-triggered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since Vav and PI3 kinase are intimately involved in the regulation of cellular growth, their tyrosine phosphorylation status was determined in unstimulated and anti-IgM- and anti-CD40-treated Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells: Vav and p85 are devoid of tyrosine-phosphorylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> in control cells whereas p85, but not Vav, is significantly phosphorylated following ligation of sIgM and anti-CD40 triggers tyrosine phosphorylation on both proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav may be a critical effector of CD40-mediated survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As tyrosine-phosphorylated PI3 kinase is common to both sIgM-triggered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and CD40-triggered survival pathways, its <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> kinase activity was correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation on p85: Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells exhibit high basal levels of PI3 kinase activity, determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-p85 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi> incorporation into phosphatidylinositol, which is not significantly affected by stimulation with anti-IgM but which is elevated by 36 +/- 2.9% following ligation of CD40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation on p85 correlates with the CD40-triggered increase in PI3 kinase activity but not with basal levels nor with sIgM-triggered levels of enzymatic activity: these data suggest the presence of different PI3 kinase isoforms or the existence of multiple regulatory pathways for the same PI3 kinase isotype in Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells </plain></SENT>
