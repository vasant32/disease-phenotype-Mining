<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that Rituximab-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">Chlorambucil</z:chebi>-Hydroxychloroquine BNPs induce a decrease in cell viability of malignant B cells in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mediated cytotoxicity resulted from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and was confirmed by monitoring the B-CLL cells after Annexin V/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional data revealed that these BNPs were non toxic for healthy animals, and had prolonged survival in this mice model of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
