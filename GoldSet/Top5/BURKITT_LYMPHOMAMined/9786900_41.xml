<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The transport of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> across cellular membranes is an essential process in mammalian cells and is mediated by the H+/monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have molecularly cloned and characterized a novel human monocarboxylate transporter, MCT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cDNA is 1,907 base pairs long and encodes a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> of 478 amino acids with 12 predicted transmembrane domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human MCT2 is the product of a single gene that mapped to chromosome 12q13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The kinetic properties of human MCT2 fulfill the criteria to establish it as a H+/monocarboxylate transporter; however, the unique biochemical feature of human MCT2 is its high affinity for the transport of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> (apparent Km of 25 microM), implying that it is a primary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> transporter in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of human MCT1 and MCT2 with regard to tissue distribution and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcript variants disclosed substantial differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human MCT2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was restricted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human tissues but widely expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines, suggesting that MCT2 may be pre-translationally regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found co-expression of human MCT1 and MCT2 at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines, including the hematopoietic lineages HL60, K562, MOLT-4, and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> cells such as SW480, A549, and G361 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the two monocarboxylate transporters, MCT1 and MCT2, have distinct biological roles </plain></SENT>
