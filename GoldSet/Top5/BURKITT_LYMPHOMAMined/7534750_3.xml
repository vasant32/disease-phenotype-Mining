<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The alpha 5 beta 1 integrin (CD49e/CD29), a heterodimeric membrane protein, is the "classical" fibronectin receptor on many cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During B-cell ontogeny, expression of the alpha 5-subunit is developmentally regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The alpha 5 beta 1 is decisive for migration on fibronectin substrate and very likely cooperates with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules in transvascular trafficking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test whether alpha 5 beta 1 influences local growth vs. disseminative spread of neoplastic B-cells in vivo, human B-cell lines mimicking different maturational stages were transferred s.c. into <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice and examined for alpha 5 beta 1 expression and for adherence on fibronectin substrate in vitro and ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines were locally tumorigenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dissemination was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals carrying Nalm-6 tumors, in one animal with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 60 and in 2 mice carrying a Raji <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, Daudi, BJAB and U266 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> did not disseminate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As evidenced by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lines and their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were to various extents beta 1-positive but showed considerable differences in alpha 5 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The functional surface expression of alpha 5 beta 1 correlated with fibronectin adherence of the lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Daudi expressed alpha 5 beta 1 in a non-functional configuration which was rendered functional only upon applying high concentrations of Mg++ and Mn++ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>B-cell lines functionally expressing alpha 5 beta 1 at high or moderate levels disseminated in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice while alpha 5-negative lines and Daudi did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results support the conclusion drawn from an earlier in situ analysis of human B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> that the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin contributes to the disseminative phenotype of malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
