<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lines the Do values were in the range 1.3 to 1.8 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the survival curves had an appreciable shoulder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extrapolation numbers varied in the range 1.0 to 1.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the cell lines had a low capacity to accumulate sublethal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, split dose experiments showed that no line had the capacity to repair sublethal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together with earlier published experimental and clinical observations the results indicate that the use of an increased number of fractions in radiotherapy of B-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> might be of great benefit to the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A schedule with an increased number of fractions will probably be as efficient in killing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells as previously used schedules but the tolerance of adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue will probably increase </plain></SENT>
