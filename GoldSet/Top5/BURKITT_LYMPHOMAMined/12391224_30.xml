<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CIITA also modulates the expression of MHC class I genes, suggesting that it may have a more global role in gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether CIITA regulates genes other than the MHC class II and I family, DNA microarray analysis was used to compare the expression profiles of the CIITA expressing B cell line Raji and its CIITA-negative counterpart RJ2.2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The comparison identified a wide variety of genes whose expression was modulated by CIITA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Real time RT-PCR from Raji, RJ2.2.5, an RJ2.2.5 cell line complemented with CIITA, was performed to confirm the results and to further identify CIITA-regulated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CIITA-regulated genes were found to have diverse functions, which could impact Ag processing, signaling, and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of note was the identification of a set of genes localized to chromosome 1p34-35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The global modulation of genes in a local region suggests that this region may share some regulatory control with the MHC </plain></SENT>
