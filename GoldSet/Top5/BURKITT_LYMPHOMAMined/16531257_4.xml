<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, mechanisms by which this GVHD-associated graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effect is exerted are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we simultaneously traced the kinetics of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor-derived and leukemic recipient-derived B-lymphopoiesis comparing patients with or without GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We used multiparameter flow-cytometry to quantify pro-B (CD19+CD10+CD34+), pre-B (CD19+CD10+CD34-) precursors and malignant lymphoblasts identified by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated markers in 161 prospective marrow samples from 39 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> patients after allogeneic SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chimerism analysis was performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction of null alleles and insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD of grades II-IV is associated with a strong inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor-derived pro-B and pre-B precursors at days +30 and +60 post-SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD have lower percentages of marrow B-cell precursors during the first year after SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, recipient-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> B cells were absent at days +30 and +60 in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD grades II-IV and were less likely to be detected in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Induction of GVHD as treatment of increasing amounts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells causes inhibition of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant B compartments even in the absence of steroid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the development of GVHD after allogeneic SCT is associated with a non-specific inhibition of B-lymphopoiesis </plain></SENT>
