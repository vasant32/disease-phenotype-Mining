<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important to remember that the early phases of this work were conducted in Africa where today, unfortunately, the disease usually results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> because of limited resources, even though most children in more developed countries are cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This must be changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is time to re-explore, with modern techniques, some of the questions that were raised some 50 years ago shortly after Burkitt's first description, as well as new questions that can be asked only in the light of modern understanding of the immune system and the molecular basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The African <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has taught us much, but there is a great deal still to be learned </plain></SENT>
