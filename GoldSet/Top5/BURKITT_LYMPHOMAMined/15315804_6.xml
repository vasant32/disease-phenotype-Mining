<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hughes examined the role of cytogenetics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> research in 1964 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the technical limitations of the day, he highlighted a number of known abnormalities which were to turn out to be crucial in our understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> genetics over the subsequent 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These included the Philadelphia translocation and the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, he mentioned that a deleted chromosome had been observed in an example of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> and double-minute chromosomes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study of these events led to the identification of the key genes involved (BCR, ABL, C-MYC, RB1 and N-MYC) and served as models for substantial further work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We review some of the technical advances in the field of molecular cytogenetics and show how they can be applied to the events reviewed by Hughes </plain></SENT>
