<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By using RNase protection analysis, residues 2677 and 2995 of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1 were identified as sites of genetic polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through use of oligonucleotide hybridization, the genomic content and expression of individual <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1 alleles were examined in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, unselected and drug selected cell lines, and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, unselected cell lines, and untreated malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples, expression of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1 from both alleles was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in drug selected cell lines, and in relapsed malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples, expression of one allele was found in a large percentage of samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To understand how expression of one allele occurs, two multidrug resistant sublines were isolated by exposing a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line to increasing concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The resistant sublines expressed only one allele and had a hybrid <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1 gene composed of non-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1 sequences proximal to <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Previous studies showing hybrid <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1 genes after rearrangements provided a potential explanation for activation and expression of one <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that oligonucleotide hybridization can be used as a sensitive tool to examine relative allelic expression of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1, and can identify abnormal expression from a single allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Acquired drug resistance in vitro and in patients is often associated with expression of a single <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1 allele, and this can be a marker of a hybrid <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1 gene </plain></SENT>
