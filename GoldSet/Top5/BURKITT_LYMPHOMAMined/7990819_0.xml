<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By means of the primer extension technique two startpoints of antisense transcription have been detected and mapped with the first (untranslated) exon of the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarity between the antisense nucleotide sequence of the first c-myc intron and the SV40 DNA fragment containing the binding sites for transcriptions factors GT-I, GT-II, TC-I, and TC-II has been revealed by computer analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been established that the DNA fragment of the first c-myc intron is able to form complexes with proteins from the HeLa cell extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three nucleotide sequences (TTTCTG, TTTTTA, and TGACTTGTC) are involved in the reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data imply that the c-myc antisense transcripts might take part in the regulation of human c-myc gene expression </plain></SENT>
