<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>While it is generally agreed that in the lymphoid differentiation of B lineage cells there is no stage in which cell-surface immunoglobulin (sIg) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) are expressed simultaneously, a few B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) cases with this phenotype have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two such cases and the derived cell lines are reported here, in which the expression of recombination activating gene-1 (RAG-1) was also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One case was a CD19+ CD22+ HLA-DR+ sIg+ (gamma, kappa) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cell line (Bay9I) also expressed CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic analysis revealed t(14;18)(q32;q21) and additional aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the other case, the fresh <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells expressed CD19, CD24 and HLA-DR antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The derived cell line (Tree92) also expressed CD22 and sIg (mu, lambda) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The karyotype of the Tree92 cells was t(8;14)(q24;q32) with additional aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tree92 is the first established cell line having both t(8;14)(q24;q32) and TdT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TdT was detected by Northern blotting as well as indirect immunofluorescence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, both Bay9I and Tree92 expressed RAG-1, as detected by Northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cross-linking of sIg on Tree92 cells with anti-mu antibody led to significant down-regulation of RAG-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It seems that there is a sIg+ TdT+ RAG-1+ B lineage differentiation stage, and that signaling through sIg can modulate RAG-1 expression </plain></SENT>
