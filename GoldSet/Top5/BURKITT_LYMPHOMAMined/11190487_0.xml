<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the pharmacokinetics of 125I- and 131I-Lym-1, and the dosimetry, efficacy, and toxicity of 131I-Lym-1 in Raji-tumored mice were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Lym-1 was radioiodinated by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53767">chloramine-T</z:chebi> method and analyzed for monomeric fraction and immunoreactivity (antigen cell binding, relative to unmodified Lym-1) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic data (total body and blood clearance and biodistribution) were used to estimate radiation dosimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mini-thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) was also used to measure radiation dosimetry directly for 7 days after injection of 131I-Lym-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> size, survival, body weight, and blood counts were monitored for 60 days to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of 131I-Lym-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the time of injection, the mean quality assurance (QA) values for 125I-Lym-1 were 100% monomer and 100% relative immunoreactivity; the corresponding values for 131I-Lym-1 were 73% and 66%, indicating that radiolysis had occurred during the interval between radiolabeling and injection </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Assuming identical pharmacokinetic behavior to 125I-Lym-1, 131I-Lym-1 would deliver radiation doses of 3.45, 0.83, 1.03, 0.34, and 0.56 Gy per MBq injected (12.8, 3.1, 3.8, 1.3, and 2.1 rad/microCi), to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, liver, lungs, total body, and marrow, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the actual pharmacokinetic data for 131I-Lym-1 (1.5 MBq) were used to estimate dosimetry, corresponding values of 0.51, 0.72, 0.49, 0.31, and 0.41 Gy/MBq (1.9, 2.7, 1.8, 1.1, and 1.5 rad/microCi) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similar values were obtained for mice receiving 7.4 or 14.8 MBq of 131I-Lym-1 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Response rates (cure + CR + PR) for mice receiving 0, 7.4, 14.8, and 18.5 MBq of 131I-Lym-1 were 8%, 7%, 21%, and 45%, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, in vitro QA results for 131I-Lym-1 indicated that radiolysis had occurred, and 131I-Lym-1 demonstrated little accumulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, or preferential radiation dosimetry to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in the same model </plain></SENT>
