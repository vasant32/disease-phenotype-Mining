<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two subtypes were described: Burkitt and non-Burkitt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Attempting to define the clinicopathologic features of the subtypes, we studied 42 patients: 25 Burkitt and 17 non-Burkitt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> demonstrated remarkable uniformity of nuclear size and contour, whereas the non-Burkitt variant had greater variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin monoclonality was demonstrated in 83% of Burkitt and 81% of non-Burkitt cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Burkitt patients tended to be younger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gastrointestinal disease</z:e> was seen in 15 Burkitt and only four non-Burkitt patients (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disseminated disease was found in the majority of both variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Marrow involvement was demonstrated in 4.5% of Burkitt and 37.5% of non-Burkitt patients (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median survival of Burkitt patients was 10.5 months versus 7.7 months in the non-Burkitt group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors believe that significant biologic differences between the variants have been demonstrated, which may be of potential value to the clinician </plain></SENT>
