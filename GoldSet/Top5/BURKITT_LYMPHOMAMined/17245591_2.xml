<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report three adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) with dic(9;20) anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients were diagnosed as cluster of differentiation 10 (CD10) positive B cell ALL, achieved complete remission after induction chemotherapy, and died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> relapse within 1 year after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens for chromosome analysis were prepared by direct method and/or short-time culture of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Karyotyping was performed by R-banding technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using chromosome 9 and chromosome 20-specific centromeric probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Karyotype analysis showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients had dic(9;20)(p11-13;q11), in which the dicentric nature of the derived chromosome was confirmed by interphase FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dicentric (9;20)(p11-13;q11) may be specifically associated with ALL, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 20 may be a pointer to dic(9;20) in ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of dic(9;20) in adult patients with ALL remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
