<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From the initiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> to the final establishment of a permanent lymphoblastoid cell line, fucosyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi> of the cell surface were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order of appearance the following events took place: expression of Epstein-Barr virus-determined nuclear antigen, mitotic activity of the cells and specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptide</z:chebi> alterations on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This specific alteration in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi>, as determined by gel filtration, is manifested by the appearance of fast-eluting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi> and was similar to that found on Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither pokeweed-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-stimulated B lymphocytes nor exponentially growing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T lymphocytes exposed fast-eluting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi> on their surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is concluded that the appearance of these fast-eluting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi> on the surface of lymphoblastoid cells after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> is not the result of culture conditions or conditions of growth as such </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The similarity with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi> derived from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, and the observation that a considerable proportion of the B cells becomes immortalized, are discussed </plain></SENT>
