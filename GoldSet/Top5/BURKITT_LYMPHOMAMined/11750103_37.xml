<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It has been demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) blasts migrate into layers of bone marrow fibroblasts (BMF) in vitro using the beta1 integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5, and that the chemokine SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4 influences ALL migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether this effect was due to SDF-1-mediated induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> through beta1 integrins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Adhesion</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> cells or the cell line NALM6 to extracellular matrix proteins was examined using short-term in vitro binding assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of exposure of cells to SDF-1, antibodies to CXCR4, and the G protein inhibitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pertussis</z:e> toxin (PTX) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The consequences of down regulation of CXCR4 on the in vivo behavior of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> cells after injection into sublethally irradiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with SDF-1 of NALM6 cells or cells from cases of precursor-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B ALL</z:e> resulted in a doubling of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to fibronectin, laminin, and VCAM-1, but had no effect on binding to collagens I or IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to CXCR4 and PTX inhibited SDF-1-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> on these substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NALM6 cells with CXCR4 expression downregulated by SDF-1 exposure demonstrated a reduced capacity to engraft into the bone marrow of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice, with only 22 +/- 11% of marrow cells being of human origin in mice receiving SDF-1-treated cells compared to 48 +/- 5% in mice receiving untreated cells (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The homing of SDF-1-treated cells to the bone marrow after 24 hours was also reduced by 72 +/- 16% compared to control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data show that SDF-1 and CXCR4 are involved in regulation of beta1 integrin function, and are important for the localization of pre-B cells to the bone marrow in vivo </plain></SENT>
