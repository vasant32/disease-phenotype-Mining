<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV has a significant role in pathogenesis of Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of EBV in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse large B cell (NHL - DLBL) in the head and neck is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to find out the difference between the presence of Epstein Barr virus in nodal and extra nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of head and neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 30 cases of DLBL in two separate groups were collected from pathology department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first group was consisted of 15 patients with DLBL of neck lymph node and the other was consisted of 15 patients with extra nodal DLBL of head and neck mainly in palatine tonsil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both immune-histo-chemical (IHC) study and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of late membrane antigen (LMP) were performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 30 cases were negative for EBV in IHC method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But in PCR method, 10% of patients were positive for LMP gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 2 positive cases in nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 1 positive case in extra nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compare with PCR method, it seems that IHC is not a sensitive method for detection of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, the finding of EBV in NHL depends on site, type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the detection method </plain></SENT>
