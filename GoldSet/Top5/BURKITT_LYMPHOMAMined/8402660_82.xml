<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have assessed the role of the p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene in cell cycle arrest and cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation in 17 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle arrest was assessed by flow cytometry of cells 16 h following irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to the usual G2 arrest, the cell lines exhibited three types of responses in G1: Class I, strong arrest in G1 following radiation; Class II, minimal arrest; and Class III, an intermediate response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Class I cells contained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> p53 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the ten lines that showed minimal G1 arrest, eight had mutant p53 alleles, and two lines were heterozygous for p53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both of the lines showing an intermediate response contained <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results are consistent with the view that mutations abrogate the ability of p53 to induce G1 arrest following radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Studies with the heterozygotes showed that the mutant protein can have a dominant negative influence upon <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53, and the reduced ability of two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> p53 lines to arrest in G1 indicated that p53 function can be impaired by other mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The radiosensitivity of most of the lines appeared to depend on the ability of p53 to induce a G1 arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean radiation dose that inhibited proliferation of the Class I lines by 50% was 0.98 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the eight p53 mutant cell lines tested, five lines required approximately 2.9 Gy to cause a 50% inhibition of cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The two heterozygotes were also more resistant to radiation than the Class I cells (50% inhibitory dose, 2.1 and 2.9 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that radioresistance is afforded by a loss of function of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53, which would normally induce a G1 arrest and promote cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the presence of DNA damage </plain></SENT>
