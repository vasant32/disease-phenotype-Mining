<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The viability of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant B-cells was shown to depend on the constitutive activation of the nuclear factor (NF)- kappaB pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, attempts to find efficient inhibitors of NF-kappaB play a central role in the search for novel anti-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of two NF-kappaB inhibitors, Bay 11-7085 (BAY) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36281">caffeic acid</z:chebi> phenethyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (CAPE), on the viability of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the mechanism(s) of the cytotoxic effect of the NF-kappaB inhibitors, BAY, and CAPE on human-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nonhematological cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BAY and CAPE were shown to kill Ramos-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with IC(50) values of 0.7 microM and 4 microM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rapid killing by BAY (h) vs the slower killing by CAPE (1-3 days), and their differential effects on the stages of the cell cycle, indicated that these drugs induce killing by different mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BAY and CAPE induced a loss of the cytoplasmic compartment and generated pyknotic nuclei, which lacked nuclear or nucleosomal fragmentation, features characteristic of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> rather than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BAY also induced a rapid loss of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> potential and rapid inhibition of p65 NF-kappaB binding to its kappaB motif without reducing the level of nuclear p65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that BAY causes a necrotic rather than apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, either through its effect on the NF-kappaB pathway and/or by affecting additional molecular targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high sensitivity of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines to the cytotoxicity of BAY, justify further research to explore its potential therapeutic effect on human B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
