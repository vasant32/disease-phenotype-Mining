<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A region of minimal deletion in B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) has recently been defined between D6S186 and D6S227 spanning 5-9 Mb at 6q26-q27, predicting the presence of at least one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene (TSG) at this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the construction of a deletion map in the B-NHL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> panel, we report the identification of a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, BL74, having an apparent homozygous deletion at the D6S347 locus, internal to the critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since this case may facilitate the localization of the target TSG, a detailed structural molecular characterization and search for candidate genes were undertaken at this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While BL74 underwent a loss of heterozygosity at 6q26-q27, D6S347 was also likely subjected to a somatic interlocus gene conversion-like event between two homologous but distinct loci, resulting in the homozygous replacement of a 1860- to 2067-bp segment of one locus with the corresponding segment copied from the other locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two genes at this locus were identified, but their lack of expression in B-cell lineages tentatively excludes them as candidate TSGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another still unidentified gene at this locus may be disrupted by the gene conversion-like event, which would represent a novel mechanism of TSG inactivation </plain></SENT>
