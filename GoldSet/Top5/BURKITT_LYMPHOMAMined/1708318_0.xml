<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cord blood mononuclear cells, incubated in the mother's own serum, showed significant modulation of class II antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was also the case for unrelated donor lymphocytes, incubated in pooled maternal serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One neoplastic line (Daudi) was further shown to down-regulate class II antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this last case, the down-regulating effect persisted over a 10-day period during which maternal serum was renewed regularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Retroplacental serum was more MHC class II-inhibiting than peripheral serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This down-regulating effect does not apply to maternal lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect is thought to be due to a factor, yet to be defined, included in the maternal IgG fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regular assays made throughout pregnancy showed that the class II inhibiting component appears early (5th week), reaches its peak value at the 12th week, and disappears 2 or 3 weeks after delivery </plain></SENT>
