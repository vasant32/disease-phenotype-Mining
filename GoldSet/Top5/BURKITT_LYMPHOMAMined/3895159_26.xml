<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sequence and hybridization analysis of these cDNAs as well as expression in E. coli provided evidence that they encode proteins which have the characteristics of IFN type I but which are sufficiently diverged in sequence from both IFN-alpha s and IFN-beta to suggest that they are representatives of a new and distinct class of interferons named interferon-omega </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hybridization of these sequences to genomic DNA reveals that this class contains at least four members </plain></SENT>
