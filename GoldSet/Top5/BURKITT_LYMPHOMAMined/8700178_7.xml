<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an effort to facilitate the greater use of the assay, a number of studies were conducted to evaluate its reliability and reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During this work, the assay was used to assess whether various metals and other compounds could induce crosslinks in cultured human lymphocytes (Epstein-Barr virus-transformed Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line) </plain></SENT>
