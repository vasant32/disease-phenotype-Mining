<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Non-T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 51 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stages of blasts differentiation were determined with the aid of monoclonal antibodies set using alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blasts in 50 patients belonged to B subpopulation confirmed by the presence of panB CD19 and CD22 antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Common antigen was seen in 76.5% of the examined patients with non-T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases of non-T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> were divided into 8 subgroups depending on the antigens of B-cells differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An identification of pre-B subgroups of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> indicates heterogenicity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> in childhood and enables their classification into groups corresponding to the early stages of lymphoblasts maturation </plain></SENT>
