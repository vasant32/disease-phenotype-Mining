<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent studies of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> (CHX)-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in sublines of established Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (BJA-B) both with and without Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, we noticed two distinct types of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, we have classified these, and further carried out a statistical analysis of their incidence in untreated and CHX-treated EBV-free (EBV(-)) and EBV-infected (EBV(+)) BJA-B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Classification: Both types of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> demonstrated typical nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, "Type 1 apoptotic cells" (AP1) maintained a spherical or ovoid shape, but "Type 2 apoptotic cells" (AP2) were typified by the lobulation of their nuclear and cytoplasmic structures to form "clover leaf" shapes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis of incidence: The numbers of AP1 and AP2 cells were analysed using a chi 2 test, with results as follows: EBV(-) cells underwent AP1 in preference to AP2 (90.5% versus 9.5%) (p &lt; 0.001), whilst EBV(+) cells had comparably more AP2, making AP1 and AP2 approximately equal (49.3% versus 50.7%) (p &gt; 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In EBV(-) cells, treatment with CHX had little effect on the ratios of differing apoptotic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the EBV(+) cells, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was altered from AP2 (50.7%--&gt;25.2%) towards AP1(49.3%--&gt;74.8%) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that cellular proteins known to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> not only protect the cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but also affect the phenotype of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This knowledge may be useful for defining possible mechanisms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction and/or inhibition in specific models </plain></SENT>
