<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patterns of relapse and observable increased disease free remission duration in the TF-treated group strongly suggest a beneficial effect particularly in the prevention of late relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A larger series of patients treated with this specific TF are needed to confirm these observations in endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
