<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent-to-lytic switch is mediated by the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> proteins BZLF1 (Z), BRLF1 (R), and BRRF1 (Na) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since we previously showed that DNA-damaging agents (including chemotherapy and irradiation) can induce EBV lytic reactivation and recently demonstrated that <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 contributes to lytic reactivation, we investigated the role of the ATM kinase during EBV reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ATM phosphorylates and activates p53, as well as numerous other substrates involved in the cellular DNA damage response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using an ATM inhibitor (KU55933), we found that ATM activity is required for efficient induction of EBV lytic gene expression by a variety of different stimuli, including a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) cytokine, a demethylating agent (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi>), B cell receptor engagement with anti-IgG antibody, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi>, and the proteosome inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In EBV-infected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGS</z:e> (gastric) cells, knockdown of ATM, or p53, expression inhibits EBV reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, treatment of these cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46742">nutlin-3</z:chebi> (which activates p53 and ATM) robustly induces lytic reactivation in a p53- and ATM-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ability of the EBV R and Na proteins to induce lytic reactivation in EBV-infected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGS</z:e> cells is ATM dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, overexpression of Z induces lytic gene expression in the presence or absence of ATM activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that ATM enhances Z promoter activity in the context of the intact EBV genome and that p53 contributes to the ATM effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, since we found that ATM inhibitors also reduce lytic reactivation in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells that have no p53, additional ATM substrates must also contribute to the ATM effect </plain></SENT>
