<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequent histotypes were small noncleaved cell, anaplastic large cell (ALC) CD30/BerH2+, and large cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of B-cell associated markers, usually including CD19, CD20, CD22, CDw75, and CD74, was found in 17 of the 22 evaluated cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven of nine ALC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were positive, as were three of five small noncleaved cell type (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), one of four small noncleaved cell type (non-Burkitt's variant), and one of four large cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate that Epstein-Barr virus genomes might be identified in more than 50% of the evaluated high grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; this association occurred significantly more often in the small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> resembling endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (60%) and with ALC CD30/BerH2+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (77.8%) </plain></SENT>
