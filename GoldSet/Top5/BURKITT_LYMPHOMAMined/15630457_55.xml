<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the direct involvement of atypical PKC-zeta in SDF-1 signaling in immature human CD34(+)-enriched cells and in leukemic pre-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) G2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chemotaxis, cell polarization, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of CD34(+) cells to bone marrow stromal cells were found to be PKC-zeta dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of PKC-zeta in G2 and U937 cells led to increased directional motility to SDF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, impaired SDF-1-induced migration of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> cell line B1 correlated with reduced PKC-zeta expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SDF-1 triggered PKC-zeta phosphorylation, translocation to the plasma membrane, and kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore we identified PI3K as an activator of PKC-zeta, and Pyk-2 and ERK1/2 as downstream targets of PKC-zeta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SDF-1-induced proliferation and MMP-9 secretion also required PKC-zeta activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we showed that in vivo engraftment, but not homing, of human CD34(+)-enriched cells to the bone marrow of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice was PKC-zeta dependent and that injection of mice with inhibitory PKC-zeta pseudosubstrate <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> resulted in mobilization of murine progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate a central role for PKC-zeta in SDF-1-dependent regulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell motility and development </plain></SENT>
