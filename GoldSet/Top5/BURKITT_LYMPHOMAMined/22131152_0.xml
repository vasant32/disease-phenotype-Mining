<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Combined therapies protocols have been emerging to improve treatment strategies to circumvent responseless <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluate the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> (CDDP) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assay was performed to assess drug toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To establish the concentrations and time of incubation for the combined treatment, a kinetic analysis was performed for each drug on BL41 and Raji <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines for 24, 48 and 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was assessed by flow cytometry using Annexin V/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI) and cleaved caspase 3 labeling assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Caspase 9 activation and levels of Bcl-2 family proteins were analyzed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The doses of NaB (1.0 mM), CDDP (1.0 and 2.5 μM), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> (0.1 and 0.3 μM) after 24 h of incubation were chosen for the evaluation of combined therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines of NaB/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> and NaB/CDDP were followed by upregulation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> protein (P &lt; 0.05), activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, followed by Mcl-1 downregulation (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> overexpression was not correlated with Bcl-2 inhibition (P &gt; 0.05) and was accompanied by increase in Bax expression (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combination effects of NaB/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> and NaB/CDDP were found to be synergistic and additive, respectively, in both the cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study provides strong evidence for the synergistic effects of the association with HDCI and chemotherapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
