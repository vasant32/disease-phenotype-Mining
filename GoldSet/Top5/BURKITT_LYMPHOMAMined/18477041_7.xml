<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and molecular genetic features of eight CLL cases with MYC rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients, five men and three women (median age, 71 years) had bone marrow involvement and an absolute peripheral blood <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo>; five had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>; seven had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prolymphocytes were increased (&gt;/=10%) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six cases were classified as CLL with increased prolymphocytes (CLL/PL; prolymphocytes 10-55%), and two were classified as CLL in prolymphocytic transformation (CLL/PT; prolymphocytes &gt;55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases co-expressed CD5, CD19, and CD23; five of eight expressed ZAP-70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of seven cases tested, four had mutated and three had unmutated IGHV genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetic studies demonstrated t(8;14)(q24.1;q32) in five cases, t(8;22)(q24.1;q11) in two cases, and t(2;8)(p12;q24.1) in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven cases contained additional chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two developed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) that were clonally unrelated to the CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, two patients are alive, four died of underlying disease, one died of EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, and one died of an unrelated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In summary, MYC rearrangement, which occurs rarely in CLL patients, is associated with increased prolymphocytes, complex cytogenetic abnormalities, and a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
