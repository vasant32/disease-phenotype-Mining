<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we have investigated the effects of human recombinant IFN-gamma on human leukemic B cell lines at different stages of maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our data show that in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> RAMOS-1 B cells IFN-gamma induces a reduction of cell growth and a clonal selection via programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; in contrast, IFN-gamma treatment of KM-3 pre-B cells does not induce biochemical and morphological changes as shown by electron microscope analysis and DNA gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
