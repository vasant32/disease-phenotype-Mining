<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected cells were shown to express iNOS constitutively at a low level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed iNOS expression by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase reaction method (RT-PCR) in eight HTLV-I-infected cell lines (five were ATL-derived lines and there were in vitro transformed lines), nine ATL patients (three were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, two were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, and four were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> type), and an HTLV-I-negative T cell line (CEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In four ATL derived and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three in vitro transformed cell lines, iNOS was expressed constitutively, but it was not expressed in CEM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four out of nine ATL patients also showed iNOS expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of iNOS was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of ATL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of four iNOS-positive patients had infiltration of ATL cells to organs such as skin, lung, or liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In NOS inhibitor (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">NG-monomethyl-L-arginine</z:chebi>: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi>)-containing medium, an iNOS-positive ATL cell line (K3T) showed growth inhibition and DNA ladder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although only a limited number of patients was analyzed, our results suggest that NO may be involved in the invasive character of ATL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The NOS inhibitor can induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in an ATL cell line, as it does in EBV-infected cell lines </plain></SENT>
