<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the MoAb ML30 was coupled to Saporin 6, a ribosome-inactivating protein recovered from the seeds of Saponaria officinalis, to kill <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-expressing cells with a specific immunotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An indirect method using first MoAb ML30 and then anti-mouse IgG1 immunotoxin was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With this method a human serum positive for HSP65-antibodies was tested using anti-human IgG1 or IgM immunotoxins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines were inhibited when preincubated with the specific immunotoxin directed to HSP65 (ML30 SO6), although H9 cells were susceptible to immunotoxin only after thermal stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Daudi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> cells were inhibited both after long-term culture and when freshly explanted from <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proliferation of the U937 monocytic cell line, that constitutively expresses high levels of HSP65 on the surface (as determined by flow cytometry), was completely inhibited (100% inhibition) by the ML30 SO6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells constitutively express high levels of surface HSP65, as determined by cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For this reason it was not always possible to obtain complete inhibition of cellular proliferation </plain></SENT>
