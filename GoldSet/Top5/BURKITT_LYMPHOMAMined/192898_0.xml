<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific antigens and EBV particle-containing cells increased in the hybrid lines (IMK1-1/VERO,HR1K/VERO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the hybrids with 5-bromodeoxyuridine induced more antigen-positive and more virus-containing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBV could be activated from IM lymphoblastoid cells by fusion of the lymphoblastoid cells with the VERO cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigens and virus particles may have been due to the cellular interaction between VERO cells and the lymphoblastoid cells or to a possible derepressor supplied by the VERO component of the hybrid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Virus derived from the HR1K cell line was replicated in the human-primate hybrid, but further investigation may be necessary to determine if it was identical to the EBV derived from the human cell line </plain></SENT>
