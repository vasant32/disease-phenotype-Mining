<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">Methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) is a key compound of chemotherapeutic regimens used in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), primary central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PCNSL) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to evaluate the role of MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and G80A reduced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> carrier gene (RFC1) in a cohort of adult patients with lymphoproliferative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> submitted to high-dose MTX followed by leucovorin rescue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed the analysis of these polymorphisms on genomic DNA with RFLP-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients carrying MTHFR A1298C variant showed decreased hepatic and hematological toxicity (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between homozygous <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and variant patients for the RFC1 G(80)A were significantly different (P = 0.035 and P = 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation between hematological toxicity and age (P = 0.003) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant influence of MTHFR C677T genotype on toxicity, OS and PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Leucovorin rescue given after high-dose MTX probably accounts for the lack of influence of C677T polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To better define a role of RFC1 polymorphism on patients outcome, it would be worthwhile to perform a study on intracellular MTX level and RFC1 substrate binding affinities in different genotypes </plain></SENT>
