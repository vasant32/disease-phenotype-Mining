<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These B95.8- and P3HR1-converted lines have been compared for their patterns of expression of EBV latent genes (i.e., those <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes constitutively expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBV-transformed lines of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell origin) and for their recognition by EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), in an effort to identify which latent gene products provide target antigens for the T-cell response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>B95.8-converted lines on several different EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-cell backgrounds <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed detectable expression of the nuclear antigens EBNA1, EBNA2, and EBNA3 and of the latent membrane protein (LMP); such converts were also clearly recognized by EBV-specific CTL preparations with restriction through selected human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I antigens on the target cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The corresponding P3HR1-converted lines (lacking an EBNA2 gene) expressed EBNA1 and EBNA3 but, surprisingly, showed no detectable LMP; furthermore, these converts were not recognized by EBV-specific CTLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such differences in T-cell recognition were not due to any differences in expression of the relevant HLA-restricting determinants between the two types of convert, as shown by binding of specific monoclonal antibodies and by the susceptibility of both B95.8 and P3HR1 converts to allospecific CTLs directed against these same HLA molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> infectious cycle, EBNA2 may be required for subsequent expression of LMP and that both EBNA2 and LMP (but not EBNA1 or EBNA3) may provide target antigens for the EBV-specific T-cell response </plain></SENT>
