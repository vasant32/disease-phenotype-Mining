<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A method was devised which allows the measurement, by direct and indirect fluorescence assay, of the binding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-coupled antibodies directed against cell-membrane antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The systems used were: (1) species-specific antigens, (2) genetically determined isoantigens, (3) virus-determined, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific antigens, and (4) membrane-bound immunoglobulin in a Burkitt cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Titration of antibodies gave straight lines in the log versus log scale, the slope of the titration curve probably being dependent on the density of antigen receptors on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
