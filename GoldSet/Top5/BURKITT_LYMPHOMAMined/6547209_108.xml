<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have extended these observations to two other translocated c-myc genes and find a common occurrence of mutation in the noncoding exon 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also found that in Raji cells, unlike other Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele of the c-myc gene is transcribed as well as the translocated gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results support a model in which c-myc oncogene activation in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> occurs by disruption of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> transcriptional control mechanism in which the c-myc protein is itself involved </plain></SENT>
