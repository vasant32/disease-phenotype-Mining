<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A novel alternative spliced cyclin-D1 transcript, called transcript[b], has been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The level of the variant transcript[b] was lower than that of the originally reported cyclin-D1 transcript, called transcript[a], in several human non-lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines but the endogenous cellular expression of transcript[b] products has not yet been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Northern-blot analysis and reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that transcript[b] <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is well expressed in B-lymphoid cell lines with t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation and at much lower or undetectable levels in other cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western-blot analysis using a human cyclin-D1-specific monoclonal antibody, which can recognize and distinguish the products of transcripts [a] and [b], strongly suggested that the transcript [b] protein is indeed expressed in these B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study provides identification of the endogenous cellular expression of the cyclin-D1-transcript[b] protein and strongly suggests that this alternative form of cyclin D1 may play a significant role in the molecular pathogenesis of B-lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation </plain></SENT>
