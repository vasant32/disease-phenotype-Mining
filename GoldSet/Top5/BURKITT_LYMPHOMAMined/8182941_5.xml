<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients subsequently relapsed, corresponding to a Kaplan-Meier estimate of disease-free survival (DFS) of 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with a historical group of autologous bone marrow recipients who have not received immunotherapy, there is no significant difference according to DFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotyping of peripheral lymphocytes at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and end of therapy cycles revealed the most significant mean increase among the NK cell population (262/microliters +/- 51 vs. 354/microliters +/- 36, p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, even CD3 positive T cells rose significantly (591/microliters vs. 689/microliters, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro NK cell activity tested against the NK sensitive myeloid leukemic cell line K562, and LAK cell activity tested against the LAK sensitive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji, was only low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An additional in vitro stimulus with nIL2, however, led to a therapy-dependent increase of cytotoxicity which was significant against Raji cells (25% +/- 4 vs. 41% +/- 5, p = 0.0124) indicating that low dose nIL2/rIFN-gamma enhances precursors of potentially cytotoxic cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
