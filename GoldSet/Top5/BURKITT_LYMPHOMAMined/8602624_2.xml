<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that overexpression of BCL-2 is related to resistance to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether in vitro culture with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (PDN) could modify the expression of BCL-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ALL cells from 21 patients were incubated for 72 hr with or without a minimally lethal (IC12) dose of PDN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro culture with PDN did not affect the percentage of positive cells, even though the mean fluorescence index was significantly increased (P = 0.0001), thus indicating a higher level of protein production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data could suggest a possible mechanism of drug resistance after treatment with PDN </plain></SENT>
