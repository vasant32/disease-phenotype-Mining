<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An essential step in the release of an extracellular enveloped virus particle is a budding event that ultimately separates virion and host cell membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For many enveloped viruses, membrane fission requires the recruitment of the class E vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) machinery by short, virally encoded <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequences termed "late-budding" or "L" domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some L-domain <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequences (e.g., PSAP) bind directly to components of class E VPS machinery, whereas others (e.g., PPxY) access it indirectly by recruiting ubiquitin ligases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, ubiquitin itself is known to be generally important for the fission of virion from cellular membranes, and because ubiquitination of cellular transmembrane proteins can signal the recruitment of class E machinery, a popular model is that deposition of ubiquitin on <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> structural proteins mediates class E machinery recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this model, we took advantage of a retroviral Gag protein from the prototypic foamy virus (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi>) that is almost devoid of ubiquitin acceptors, and we engineered it to generate extracellular virus-like particles in the complete absence of other <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, we found that particle budding, induced by a class E VPS machinery-binding L domain (PSAP), proceeded efficiently in the absence of ubiquitin acceptors in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi> Gag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, when particle release was engineered to be dependent on a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> PPXY motif, the requirement for a catalytically active ubiquitin ligase was maintained, irrespective of the presence or absence of ubiquitin acceptor sites in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi> Gag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, in this model system, ubiquitin conjugation to transacting factors, not <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> proteins, appears critical for ubiquitin-dependent enveloped <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> particle release </plain></SENT>
