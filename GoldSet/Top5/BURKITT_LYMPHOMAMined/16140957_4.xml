<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Given that expression of c-Myc is up-regulated in many human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, targeted inactivation of this oncoprotein is a potentially effective strategy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of protein degradation is highly specific and can be engineered to achieve the elimination of undesirable proteins such as oncogene products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now generated a fusion protein (designated Max-U) that is composed both of Max, which forms a heterodimer with c-Myc, and of CHIP, which is a U box-type ubiquitin ligase (E3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Max-U physically interacted with c-Myc in transfected cells and promoted the ubiquitylation of c-Myc in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It also reduced the stability of c-Myc in vivo, resulting in suppression of transcriptional activity dependent on c-Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of Max-U reduced both the abundance of endogenous c-Myc in and the proliferation rate of a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, expression of Max-U but not that of a catalytically inactive mutant thereof markedly inhibited both the anchorage-independent growth in vitro of NIH 3T3 cells that overexpress c-Myc as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation by these cells in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the targeted destruction of c-Myc by an artificial E3 may represent an effective therapeutic strategy for certain human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
