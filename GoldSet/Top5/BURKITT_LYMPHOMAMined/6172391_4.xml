<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Protein A (pA), was found to augment the natural killing (NK) activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes against Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived Raji and Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pA-enhanced NK activity was determined using the 51Chromium release microcytotoxicity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that the increased NK activity was dependent on the concentration of pA used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the pA-enhanced NK activity was dependent on the time of incubation of pA with the effector and target cell mixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of effectors for 16 h or more dramatically increased the NK activity against a wide range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> targets of different origin and possessing either B, T or null cell surface characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-genome in the target cells did not influence the pA-enhanced NK activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nylon-wool column-fractionated, non-adherent lymphocytes (enriched in NK cells) showed an increased NK activity in the presence of pA than unfractionated lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of certain targets with pA rendered them more sensitive to NK lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interferon production was readily detected in supernatants from cultures of pA-treated effectors or effector-target mixtures, but not in supernatants from pA-treated target cultures tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results of different physicochemical treatments indicate that the pA-induced interferon is of gamma type (type II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the data presented suggest that the pA-induced enhancement of NK activity is most likely mediated by the pA-induced interferon </plain></SENT>
