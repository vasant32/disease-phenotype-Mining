<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD11a, CD11b, CD11c and CD18 were detected on the megakaryocytic cell lines DAMI and HEL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A low and variable expression of CD11a, CD11b and CD18 determinants was also detected on resting platelets; this expression was markedly increased when platelets were activated by thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD18 was closely correlated to that of CD11a or CD11b when comparing the fluorescence intensity observed in different experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In presence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+, platelets did bind to a RAJI cell line which exhibits a high expression level of CD54 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This binding was increased when platelets were activated by thrombin and was decreased by an anti CD11a, CD18 and anti CD54 mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that human platelets express molecules of the beta2 integrin family, when activated, which allows them to bind to CD54 bearing cells </plain></SENT>
