<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over a 10-year study period, we saw 106 patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 21 with unusual localisations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms or discovery was 15.48 years, and more patients were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 8 cases of primary Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in a rare localisation and 13 cases of unusual localisations of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent of these rare lesions were renal (6), ovarian (4), in peripheral nodes (4), testicular (3), and mammary (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Still rarer were thyroid, skin, pulmonary, and suprarenal localisations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations were non-specific and difficult to differentiate from other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CMA protocol produced complete remission in 29% of cases (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the rare forms of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are non-specific and can be mistaken for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis should thus be based on histochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
