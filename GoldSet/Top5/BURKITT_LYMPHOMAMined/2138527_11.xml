<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Distinct expression pattern of CD10 molecules during B cell activation was analysed using in vivo and in vitro systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By two-colour flowcytometrical analysis, CD10 was found to be expressed at a specific stage of in vivo activating B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD10 during B cell activation appeared to be unique from that of other activation-related B cell antigens including L29, MA6, OKT9 and OKT10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the expression of CD10 was associated with that of the activation-related B cell antigens, CD10+ B cells could be separated in the distinct fractions to those expressing other activation-related B cell antigens when fractionated by cell gravity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, certain CD10+ B cells were detected positive for the resting B cell antigen, L30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies revealed that CD10+ B cells arose from CD10- B cells at an early step of B cell activation, and disappeared lately when activated by Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, CD10 was an antigen transiently expressed at an early phase of B cell activation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD10 and other antigens on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (15 cases) was studied next </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were CD10+, and 87% (13 cases) were also L30+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, six of CD10+ L30+ cases were L29+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This observation suggested that Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were phenotypically similar to the B cells at an early phase of activation, those expressing CD10 and L30, simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study has dissected a precise expression pattern of CD10 on mature B cell activation in vitro and in vivo, and could be implicated for the histogenesis of one of the poorly characterized B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, namely Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
