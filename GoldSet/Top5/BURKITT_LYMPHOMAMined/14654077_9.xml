<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to determine if expression of these angiogenic molecules also extend to childhood precursor B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now show that transcripts of VEGF, and its receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 are concomitantly expressed in both ALL cell lines and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blot and ELISA consistently detected VEGF protein in the supernatants of the cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 proteins are also detectable by FACS analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the expression of the receptors in immature B cells is limited to the intra-cytoplasmic compartment and may suggest either internalization of the receptors or a block in trafficking of the receptor to the surface </plain></SENT>
