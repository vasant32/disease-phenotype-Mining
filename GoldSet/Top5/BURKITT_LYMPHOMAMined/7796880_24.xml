<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human and rodent cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were observed to express high levels of a novel 45,000 M(r) protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The protein, which we have termed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> specific protein (ASP), was found in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells and in adenovirus-transformed human and rat embryo cells induced into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by a variety of stimuli, including serum deprivation, exposure to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi>, ionomycin, treatment with inhibitors of macromolecular synthesis (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi>), and cold shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells treated with apoptotic stimuli, expression of the oncoprotein Bcl-2 was found to both protect from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and prevent expression of ASP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ASP was not detected either in viable cells or in cells dying passively by <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laser scanning confocal microscopy showed high levels of ASP in the cytoplasm of cells displaying the chromatin condensation and fragmentation patterns typical of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Retention of ASP was observed even when DNA was no longer detectable, and two-color immunofluorescence staining indicated that the protein primarily colocalized with, but was clearly distinct from, non-muscle actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings, together with the observation that biochemical extraction of ASP was only possible under conditions which caused solubilization of the cytoskeleton, leads us to conclude that ASP forms part of, or at least strongly associates with, a modified cytoskeleton unique to cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While elucidation of its function will require further work, ASP constitutes a powerful marker for the diagnosis and quantitation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
