<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that an activity which is capable of precipitating purified C1q and inhibiting some of the C1q-dependent biologic reactions could be solubilized from the membranes of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human peripheral B lymphocytes and a B cell-derived lymphoblastoid cell line (Raji), both of which are known to possess receptors for human C1q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report we present evidence that this membrane-associated C1q inhibitor is a chondroitinase-insensitive <z:chebi fb="4" ids="33839">macromolecule</z:chebi> and is the receptor for human C1q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The receptor was solubilized from membranes of Raji cells with Nonidet P-40 and purified to homogeneity using C1q-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> 4B affinity chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Equilibrium density gradient centrifugation analysis revealed that the complex could be resolved into a protein-rich, low density fraction and a carbohydrate-rich, high density fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The large hydrodynamic size, coupled with the high buoyant density, suggests that a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> is a constituent of the complex and indicates that the receptor might be a macromolecular complex of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> portion noncovalently linked to a 60-70 kD <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> moiety, in turn, consists of two or more identical (70,000 mol wt) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16541">polypeptide chains</z:chebi> held together by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonds and constitutes the C1q receptor (C1qR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">Sucrose</z:chebi> density ultracentrifugation analysis showed that the isolated receptor sediments with an apparent rate of 4.2 S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunochemical analyses demonstrated that a typical preparation of the C1qR complex consists of approximately 23% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27252">uronic acid</z:chebi> and approximately 21% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28328">galactosamine</z:chebi> with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28328">galactosamine</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> ratio of 3.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Binding of C1q to the receptor was found to be optimal at low ionic strength and neutral or near-neutral pH (7-7.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The isolated receptor was found to inhibit C1q hemolytic function, abrogate C1q-dependent rosette formation, and block the C1q-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which are activities mediated by the receptor </plain></SENT>
