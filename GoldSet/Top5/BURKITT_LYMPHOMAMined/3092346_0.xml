<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the Raji cell binding material could not be separated from monomeric IgG by Sephacryl S-300 gel chromatography in any of the 16 sera investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The parallel elution profile of monomeric IgG and the Raji cell binding activity suggested that anti-Raji cell antibodies, rather than immune complexes of low molecular weight, were present in these sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was further substantiated by pepsin digestion of the Raji cell binding IgG fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The binding of F(ab')2 fragments was quantitatively comparable to the binding of undigested IgG, and the bound F(ab')2 fragments could be visualized by immunofluorescence at the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of antibodies against Raji cells was further confirmed by the complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These antibodies did not react with untransformed lymphocytes and there was no correlation with anti-Epstein-Barr virus antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of cytotoxic anti-Raji cell antibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> was 12% compared to 20% in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, to 0% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and patients with degenerative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, and to 5% in patients with auto-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
