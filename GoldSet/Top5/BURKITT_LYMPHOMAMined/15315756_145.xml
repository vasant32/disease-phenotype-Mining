<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These translocations frequently involve Ig switch regions, suggesting that they might be the result of aberrant Ig class switch recombination (CSR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a direct link between CSR and chromosome translocations has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have examined c-myc/IgH translocations in IL6 transgenic mice that are mutant for activation induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase (AID), the enzyme that initiates CSR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we report that AID is essential for the c-myc/IgH chromosome translocations induced by IL6 </plain></SENT>
