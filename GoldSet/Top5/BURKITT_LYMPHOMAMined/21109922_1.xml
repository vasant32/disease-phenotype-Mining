<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although disruption of genes related to hematopoiesis often leads to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the involvement of TIS11D in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we identified a heterozygous frameshift mutation (I373fsX91) in the carboxy-terminus of the TIS11D gene in leukemic cells from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, biallelic inactivation of the TIS11D gene resulting from a hemizygous frameshift mutation (G107fsX80) was identified in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line DG75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In HeLa cells, overexpression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> TIS11D protein (TIS11D(WT)) induced growth inhibition and an S phase checkpoint response, while the mutant protein (TIS11D(I373fsX91)) showed a diminished effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this response was accompanied by p21 downregulation, which is frequently seen in the cellular response to ultraviolet irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the dysregulation of TIS11D function is associated with the pathogenesis of certain types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
