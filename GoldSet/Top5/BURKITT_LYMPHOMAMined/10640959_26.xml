<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It remains unclear whether the presence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has prognostic implications for patients with primary small intestine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinicopathologic features of 80 patients with primary small intestine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were examined retrospectively in relation to the presence of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival was compared univariately and multivariately among the groups divided by clinicopathologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one cases (26%) were diagnosed as low grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (15 marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of MALT type, 2 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 4 follicle center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), 46 cases (58%) were diagnosed as high grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (19 secondary large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a low grade MALT component, 17 diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> without MALT features, 7 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 3 lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), and 13 cases (16%) were diagnosed as T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significantly better survival was noted for patients without colorectal and/or gastric involvement, diffuse infiltration under macroscopy, high grade histology, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those patients with MALT type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, less advanced stage of disease, B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, benign lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, and radical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resectability appeared to have a better survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on Cox multivariate analysis, early stage disease and MALT-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were determined to be independent prognostic factors (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of MALT-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> appears to have a favorable prognosis among patients with primary small intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
