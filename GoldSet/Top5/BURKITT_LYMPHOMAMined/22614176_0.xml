<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In virally associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, the host-pathogen interaction could involve alteration in miR expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded EBNA2 is indispensable for the capacity of the virus to transform B cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied how it affects cellular miRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extensive miR profiling of the virus-infected and EBNA2-transfected B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells revealed that oncomiR miR-21 is positively regulated by this <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines infected with EBNA2 lacking P3HR1 strain did not show any increase in miR-21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBNA2 increased phosphorylation of AKT and this was directly correlated with increased miR-21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, miR-146a was downregulated by EBNA2 in B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low miR-146a expression correlates with an elevated level of IRAK1 and type I interferon in EBNA2 transfectants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the present data suggest that EBNA2 might contribute to EBV-induced B-cell transformation by altering miR expression and in particular by increasing oncomiR-like miR-21 and by affecting the antiviral responses of the innate immune system through downregulation of its key regulator miR-146a </plain></SENT>
