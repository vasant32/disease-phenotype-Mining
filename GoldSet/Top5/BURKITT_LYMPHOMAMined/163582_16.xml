<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have emphasized that the transitory antibody responses to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced early antigens (EA) in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> are usually directed against the D (diffuse) component of the EA complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report clinical and serologic data have been presented on 14 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> who responded either solely with antibodies to the R (restricted) component of the EA complex or revealed anti-R after the initial anti-D responses had subsided weeks or months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-R persisted usually for many months , as many as 39, but in some patients it was no longer detectable in late follow-up serum spectimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although many patients had an unremarkable course of illness, others, mostly those with late anti-R responses, showed unusual or protracted clinical manifestations and several complained over periods of 4 to 28 months of recurrent symptoms resembling those experienced during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of anti-R and the relatively high continuous titers of antibodies to EB <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigens (VCA) may reflect a more than usual, persistent EBV activity which, in turn, may account for the recurrent symptoms </plain></SENT>
