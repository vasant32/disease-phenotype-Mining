<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rapidly dividing centroblasts and the nondividing centrocytes represent the two major B cell subsets present in germinal center and also the most common <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts for a majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD77 expression was previously associated to proliferating centroblasts undergoing somatic hypermutation, but data from transcriptional studies demonstrate that CD77 is not a reliable marker to discriminate human centroblasts from centrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Herein we were able for the first time to separate these two subpopulations based on the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 allowing their characterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic and functional features were especially explored, giving an accurate definition of CXCR4(+) centroblasts compared with CXCR4(-) centrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that CXCR4(+) and CXCR4(-) germinal center B cells present a clear dichotomy in terms of proliferation, transcription factor expression, Ig production, and somatic hypermutation regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis identified an extensive gene list segregating these B cells, including highly relevant genes according to previous knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By gene set enrichment analysis we demonstrated that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> gene expression signature was significantly enriched in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our findings show that CXCR4 expression can properly separate human centroblasts from centrocytes and offer now the possibility to have purified <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts of mature B cell-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
