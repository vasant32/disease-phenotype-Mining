<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The numbers of CD3-CD56+, CD16+, and CD8-CD57+ cells in peripheral blood were analyzed with monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after discontinuation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CD3-CD56+ and CD16+ cell counts of ALL patients (n = 14) were below the mean -1 SD values of controls at cessation but normalized within one month due to a rapid 2.1 and 4.5 fold increase, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CD8-CD57+ cell count of ALL patients was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> compared to controls at cessation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> patients (n = 11), the counts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NK <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotypes</z:mp> studied were of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> amount compared to controls at cessation and no vigorous increase occurred after the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NK cell function was determined by killing K 562 target cells in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the two standard risk ALL patients tested, the activity was still low at 5 months after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the function was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at 1 month (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e>), 3 months (Mb Hodgkin's) and 6 months (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, NK cell counts were decreased compared to controls during therapy for ALL, but recovered rapidly afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In spite of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counts, NK cell function may be impaired for several months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number and function of NK cells is less affected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These differences may reflect the milder immunosuppressive effect of interval <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> medication in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> patients when compared to the more intensive continuous therapy in ALL patients </plain></SENT>
