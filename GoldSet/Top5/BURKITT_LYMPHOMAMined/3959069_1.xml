<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a sample preparation method for measuring <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> in individual whole lymphocytes by electron probe X-ray microanalysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We use Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in culture as the test sample and compare X-ray microanalysis of individual cells with atomic absorption analysis of pooled cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determine the <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> peak-to-local continuum X-ray intensity ratio by electron probe X-ray microanalysis and calculate a mean cell <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> concentration of 39 +/- 19 mmol/kg dry weight from analysis of 100 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determine a mean cell <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> concentration of 34 +/- 4 mmol/kg dry weight by atomic absorption analysis of pooled cells in three cell cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean cell <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> concentrations determined by the two methods are not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We find a 10% coefficient of variation for both methods of analysis and a 30% coefficient of variation in <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> concentration among individual cells by electron probe X-ray microanalysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We wash cells in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi> nitrate for microanalysis or in buffered saline <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> for atomic absorption analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We find cells washed in either solution have the same cell viability (85%), recovery (75%), cell volume (555 microns 3) and cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We air dry cells on thin film supports and show by <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> X-ray mapping that <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> is within the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that: our microanalysis cell preparation method preserves whole intact lymphocytes; there is no systematic difference in results from the two methods of analysis; electron probe X-ray microanalysis can determine the variation in <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> concentration among individual cells </plain></SENT>
