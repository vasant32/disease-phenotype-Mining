<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>XLP is primarily characterized by a defective immune response against the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), resulting in an unusually severe and often fatal clinical course following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is the development of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, both in EBV-infected and EBV-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study whether the clinical manifestation of XLP gene defects and/or polymorphisms extends beyond the classically recognized phenotype, we analyzed patients for the presence of SH2D1A gene alterations who presented with fatal or nonfatal, yet unusually severe or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infections</z:e>, and other possibly EBV-associated diseases, such as Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> or nonendemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and Burkitt-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified mutations of the SH2D1A gene only in the majority of patients presenting with fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mononucleosis</z:e> or an XLP family history, but not in any of the other patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only alteration determined was a polymorphism in the 5' region of the SH2D1A gene both in patient groups as well as in controls </plain></SENT>
