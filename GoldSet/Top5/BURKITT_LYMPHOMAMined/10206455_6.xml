<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The hospital registry, the Cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Registry, and the two established Swedish registries for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (the Swedish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry and the National Registry for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumours</z:e> in Childhood) were searched for children in western Sweden with NHL diagnosed from 1975 to 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical files of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with NHL were collected and abstracted for information regarding age at diagnosis, gender, disease characteristics, treatment, and outcome of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sections from paraffin-embedded blocks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a diagnosis of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were collected and reexamined histopathologically and immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To guarantee that no patients with NHL were misdiagnosed, a reexamination of other childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> collected from these registries was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up duration of surviving patients is 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The annual incidence of NHL in children younger than 15 years of age was 9/million children, representing 6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> during the investigation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The male-female ratio was 4.1:1.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunologic marker studies were available for 64 of the 77 NHLs: 41 patients had B-cell, 17 had T-cell, and 6 had Ki-1-positive anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients with Ki-1-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> were originally thought to have malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_653'>Langerhans cell histiocytosis</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCH</z:e>), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment was the most significant prognostic factor; event-free survival (EFS) was 19% in the preprotocol era (1975 to 1979) and 74% from 1980 to 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other than treatment, stage was the most significant prognostic factor; EFS was 86% for patients (1980 to 1994) with stage I or II disease and 64% for patients with stage III or IV disease, with a dismal prognosis for children with initial involvement of the bone marrow or central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (EFS was 38% and 20%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Bulky disease and performance state at diagnosis were independent prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The patterns of relapse, including early recurrence of the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, are in accordance with previous experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of NHL was found to be somewhat higher than reported in our previous Nordic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The higher incidence found in this study might be the result of the thorough data collection (based on hospital registry and cross-checked with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> registries for malignant diseases in Sweden) or because reexamination of the tissue material was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A more pronounced male predominance than found in previous investigations was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotypic distribution and the stage distribution is in accordance with earlier investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Treatment was the most important factor affecting outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A dramatic improvement of survival was seen with the introduction of intensive therapy; treatment success can be expected in 86% of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> and 64% of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The absence of improvement in survival despite further treatment stratification with the introduction of the BFM protocol for B-cell-NHL is surprising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>LSA2L2-like protocols seem to be as effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Future studies on treatment of NHL must also concentrate on reducing the intensity of therapy in patients with lower risk disease to minimize late toxic effects </plain></SENT>
