<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sendai virus (SeV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of B lymphoid Namalwa cells transiently induces the transcriptional expression of multiple IFN-A genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although transcriptional activation of IFN-A genes has been extensively studied, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation of their expression remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> of Namalwa cells induces transient recruitment of HDAC3 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase 3) to IFN-A promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of chromatin-protein association by Chip-QPCR demonstrated that recruitment of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3 and IRF7, as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> correlated with enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation, whereas recruitment of HDAC3 correlated with inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3K9/K14 acetylation, removal of IRF7 and TATA-binding protein (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi>) from IFN-A promoters and inhibition of virus-induced IFN-A gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, HDAC3 overexpression reduced, and HDAC3 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> by siRNA enhanced IFN-A gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, activation of IRF7 enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3K9/K14 acetylation and IFN-A gene expression, whereas activation of both IRF7 and IRF3 led to recruitment of HDAC3 to the IFN-A gene promoters, resulting in impaired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3K9 acetylation and attenuation of IFN-A gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Altogether these data indicate that reversal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3K9/K14 acetylation by HDAC3 is required for attenuation of IFN-A gene transcription during <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
