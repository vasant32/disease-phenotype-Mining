<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with beta(-) particle emitting radionuclides targeting the CD20 antigen on B cells in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has provided the most compelling human clinical data for the success of RIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD19, like CD20, is an antigen expressed on the surface of cells of the B lineage, and CD19 may provide an alternative target for radioimmunotherapy of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD19 has been largely overlooked as a target for conventional 131I RIT, because the antigen rapidly internalizes upon binding of antibody, resulting in catabolism and significant release of 131I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such modulation may be an advantage to RIT with radiometals such as 90Y, 177Lu, 213Bi and 225Ac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Herein, we have compared beta(-) particle RIT with antibodies targeting either CD19 or CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 antibodies, B4 or C2B8, respectively, were appended with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi>-CHX-A''-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> bifunctional chelating agent and labeled with 90Y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> model used, there were three times as many CD20 target sites on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells as compared to CD19 sites (62000 vs 20000 binding sites, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We compared the efficacy of the 90Y-labeled antibodies to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in a <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> model, after measurable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size began at day 3 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three 90Y-treated groups, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> began to recur in many animals 9 days after the treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was one cure in each specific treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in the two control groups showed no regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a significant prolongation of median survival time from xenograft (P &lt; 0.0001) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 90Y-labeled antibody construct-treated groups (32 days for 0.15 mCi 90Y-B4; 26 days for 0.20 mCi 90Y-C2B8, and 23 days for 0.15 mCi 90Y-C2B8) in comparison to the two control groups (11 days for 0.02 mg of C2B8 and 9 days for untreated growth controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Specificity of the radioimmunotherapy was also shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, 90Y-labeled anti-CD19 antibody has efficacy comparable to 90Y-labeled anti-CD20 antibody in the treatment of mice bearing human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that CD19-targeted RIT merits further study </plain></SENT>
