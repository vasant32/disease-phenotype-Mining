<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Function of the allografts was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, screening for EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> did not respond to antiviral therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent to the intervention, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> disappeared, EBV DNA became undetectable and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> screening remained negative </plain></SENT>
