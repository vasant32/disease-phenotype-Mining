<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In healthy seropositive adults, the EBV-carrying B cell was predominantly within the IgM- and IgD-positive but not the IgG-positive subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these B lymphocytes were in the low-density (large cell) Percoll fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IgM- and IgD-positive B <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> suggests the EBV-carrying B cells to be circulating virgin B cells recently released from the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These B cells have an estimated life span of only 6-8 weeks suggesting that long-term EBV persistence in the body may be the result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of a more primitive B-cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar experiments were carried out in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> from the Gambia, West Africa, where Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) is endemic in order to determine whether a population of EBV-carrying B cells could be identified which had a similar phenotype to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EBV-carrying B cells in this patient group were also found in the IgM-positive, IgG-negative B-cell subpopulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of these cells were found in the low-density (large cell) Percoll fraction although in some patients a proportion was derived from the high-density (small cell) fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> is not representative of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell </plain></SENT>
