<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A novel role for shedding of the surface molecule L-selectin has been proposed as an adjunctive phenomenon during cell detachment from marrow stroma or vessel endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wished to examine whether variations in expression of L-selectin on a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cell line were linked to shedding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Mapping of L-selectin expression on the surface of Daudi <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was performed by flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of shed L-selectin were evaluated by Western blotting of culture supernatants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of cell cycle and proliferative activity was performed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Large Daudi cells in S+G(2)/M phases were L-selectin positive, whereas small Daudi cells in G(0)/G(1) phase were L-selectin negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During mitosis, L-selectin was distributed along the cleavage furrow, and gradually lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy revealed that separating Daudi cells were negative for L-selectin on the entire surface, except minute aggregates of L-selectin within the cleavage furrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Addition of agents known to interfere with the ligand-binding portion of L-selectin (sulfatides, MoAbs: Lam1.3 and TQ1) results in loss of L-selectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Removal of L-selectin by digestion with chymotrypsin inhibits Daudi proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The MoAb FMC46 did not interfere with proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Proliferating Daudi cells produced large quantities of shed L-selectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Daudi proliferation resulted in levels of shed L-selectin below the limit of detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: L-selectin is re-distributed on the cell surface of Daudi cells during the last phase of mitosis, in which plasma membrane invagination occurs between newly formed daughter cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Shedding of L-selectin is involved in the cytokinesis of Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
