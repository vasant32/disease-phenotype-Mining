<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin was high in relapsing patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in most patients in complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with an uncomplicated course, levels of ferritin increased during the first month after BMT with subsequent decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and five with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> had high serum ferritin levels despite achieving apparent complete hematological remission which was of short duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients at presentation and during remission and with healthy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients and in 3 of the 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients the percent of ferritin glycosylation was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was low at the time of diagnosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the percent glycosylation proved a more reliable marker for clinical remission than total serum ferritin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During follow up after BMT in uncomplicated cases, the percent of glycosylated ferritin returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels earlier than the total serum ferritin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the evaluation of the amount of glycosylated ferritin may provide useful information in hematological patients in whom there is a discrepancy between high serum ferritin levels and the clinical condition </plain></SENT>
