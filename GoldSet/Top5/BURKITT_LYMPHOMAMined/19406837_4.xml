<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Current treatments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (sBL) are associated with severe toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of sBL formation would facilitate development of less toxic therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The etiology of sBL remains, however, largely unknown, C-MYC up-regulation being the only lesion known to occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sBL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several studies examining the role of C-MYC in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> have concluded that C-MYC translocation is not the only critical event and that additional unidentified factors are expected to be involved in the formation of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We herein report that a gene distinct from C-MYC, E2F1, is involved in the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or most sBL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that E2F1 is highly expressed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and sBL <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that its elevated expression is not merely the consequence of the presence of more cycling cells in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> relative to other cell lines or to other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In fact, we show that reduction of its expression in sBL cells inhibits <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation and decreases their proliferation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also provide data suggesting that E2F1 collaborates with C-MYC in sBL formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>E2F1 expression down-regulation did not affect, however, the proliferation of human primary diploid fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because E2F1 is not needed for cell proliferation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, our results reveal E2F1 as a promising therapeutic target for sBL </plain></SENT>
