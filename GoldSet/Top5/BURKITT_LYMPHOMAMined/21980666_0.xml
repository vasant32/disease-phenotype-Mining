<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has tendency for extranodal localization primarily in the gastrointestinal tract and retroperitoneum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the stomach is very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stomach is most frequently involved secondarily, growing from intrabdominal tumorous mass into the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE OUTLINE: The authors present a 30-year-old male in whom after 6 months duration of temporarily melaenas the diagnosis of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was established by endoscopic examination and biopsy of ulceroinfiltrative lesion on the antral part of the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was in clinical stage IIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After one cycle of chemotherapy according to protocol R-HyperCVAD, a subtotal distal gastrectomy and additional three cycles of the same chemotherapeutic protocol a complete remission was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a highly aggressive non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> often present in extranodal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It should be treated with systemic intensive chemotherapy and surgical removal of tumorous mass when possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival using the combination therapy is possible to achieve in 40-80% of patients </plain></SENT>
