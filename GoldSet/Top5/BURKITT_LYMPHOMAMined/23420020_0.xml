<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> cell capturing is first accomplished via aptamer-aided recognition, and the cell-aptamer binding events then mediate an alkaline phosphatase-catalyzed silver deposition reaction which can be probed by electrochemical detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following biocatalytic silver deposition, an efficient amplification approach for sensitive electrochemical measurements is demonstrated, for cell detection with high sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ramos cell are used as a model case, a typical biomarker of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> blood cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results reveal that the developed technique displays desirable selectivity in Ramos cell discrimination, and linear response range from 10 to 10 cells with a detection limit as low as 10 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to the simple procedures, label-free and electrochemistry based detection format, this technique is simple and cost-effective, and exhibits excellent compatibility with miniaturization technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The electrochemical cell detection strategy may create an intrinsically specific and sensitive platform for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell assay and associated studies </plain></SENT>
