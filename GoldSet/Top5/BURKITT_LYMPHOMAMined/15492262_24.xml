<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The transcription factor PAX5 plays a key role in the commitment of hematopoietic precursors to the B-cell lineage, but its expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> has not been thoroughly investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hereby, we analyzed routine biopsies from 360 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> of lymphoid (ALLs) and myeloid (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e>) origin with a specific anti-PAX5 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blasts from 150 B-cell ALLs showed strong PAX5 nuclear expression, paralleling that of CD79a in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, PAX5 was not detected in 50 T-cell ALLs, including 20 cases aberrantly coexpressing CD79a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 160 cytogenetically/molecularly characterized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e>, PAX5 was selectively detected in 15 of 42 cases bearing the t(8;21)/AML1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Real-time reverse transcription-PCR studies in t(8;21)-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> showed a similar up-regulation of PAX5 transcript in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 8 tested samples (including 4 cases that were negative at anti-PAX5 immunostaining), suggesting that PAX5 is expressed in t(8;21)-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> more widely than shown by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, PAX5(+) t(8;21)-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> also expressed CD79a and/or CD19 (major transcriptional targets of PAX5 in B-cells) in 10 of 12 evaluable cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that PAX5 is a more specific marker than CD79a for B-cell ALL diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e>, PAX5 expression selectively clusters with t(8;21), allowing its immunohistochemical recognition in a proportion of cases, and likely explaining a peculiar biological feature of this subset of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, i.e. the aberrant expression of B-cell genes </plain></SENT>
