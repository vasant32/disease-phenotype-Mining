<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PMN killed target cells by nonoxidative means, as indicated by the following observations: PMN from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740451" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">granulomatous disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CGD</z:e>), defective in their metabolic burst, lysed Raji cells normally; impairment of the oxidative metabolism of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PMN by phenylbutazone did not affect ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rosenthal's inhibitor of phospholipase A2 completely prevented the lysis, suggesting the involvement of this enzyme in the target cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of the Raji cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> redox cycle by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3423">carmustine</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3423">1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea</z:chebi> (BCNU)] increased cell susceptibility to PMN-mediated ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This increment of lysis was related to oxidative killing systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In fact, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CGD</z:e> PMN had an ADCC against BCNU-treated Raji cells lower than that mediated by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PMN, but comparable to that observed with untreated targets, and phenylbutazone reduced the lysis of BCNU-treated Raji cells by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PMN to the level observed with the use of untreated targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining ADCC against BCNU-treated Raji cells mediated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CGD</z:e> PMN and by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PMN in the presence of phenylbutazone was suppressed by Rosenthal's inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus PMN killed sensitized BCNU-treated Raji cells by use of both oxidative and nonoxidative means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the interaction of sensitized Raji cells with PMN triggers simultaneously oxidative and non-oxidative potentially lytic systems and the mediator(s) of Raji cell lysis actually operating may depend on the metabolic state of the target cells themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the lysis of sensitized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells might not reflect the simple effect of PMN tumoricidal systems; rather it should be regarded as a result of an inability of the target cells to escape the various PMN cytolytic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
