<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show here that some inhibitors of protein kinases exacerbate radiation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the human cell line BM13674 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The specific protein kinase A inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16092">isoquinoline</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamide</z:chebi> (20 microM) gave rise to significantly increased levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> at 2-6 h postirradiation compared to values after radiation exposure only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same concentration of isoquinolinesulfonamide, which was effective in increasing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, reduced activity markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 66% inhibition of cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-dependent protein kinase A activity occurred in unirradiated cells at this concentration of H89 and activity was reduced to 58% in irradiated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C, at a concentration of 0.1 microM, which caused 68% inhibition of enzyme activity in irradiated cells, failed to enhance the level of radiation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other kinase inhibitors did not lead to an additional increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> over and above that observed after irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results obtained here provide further support for an important role for modification of existing proteins during radiation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
