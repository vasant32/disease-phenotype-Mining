<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were two major histologic types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in our series: lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, which presented most often with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025063" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mediastinal tumor</z:e> (64%), and undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (mostly Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>), which occurred predominantly in the abdomen (86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to examine the determinants of prognosis in a uniformly treated patient group that included 31 children (2-16 yr) and 34 young adults 17-35 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with extensive bone marrow involvement (greater than 50% replacement by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted essentially of a 4-drug combination (cytoxan, adriamycin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) alternating with a 42-hr <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> infusion, followed by leukovorin rescue, and included intrathecal prophylactic therapy against central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with localized or resected undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> received 6 therapy cycles; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients received 15 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiation therapy was used only in exceptional circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight of 65 patients (89%) achieved complete remission: 97% of children and 82% of adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated 3-yr survival was 60% (SE 6.4%) with a median follow-up of 3 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of factors associated with remission duration and survival indicated that bone marrow involvement at referral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> were poor prognostic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and patients with completely resected undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had the best prognosis (81% +/- 12% and 94% +/- 6% estimated 3-yr survival, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with extensive intraabdominal undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (stage D) had the worst prognosis (33% +/- 11% estimated 3 yr survival), but even in this subgroup, bone marrow involvement was an adverse factor (estimated survival in stage D patients with and without bone marrow involvement was 14% +/- 13% and 43% +/- 15%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Elevated <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> and/or lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) were also of prognostic significance, but predominantly reflected state, i.e., extent of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Age did not significantly influence prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subgroup, histology (i.e., Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> versus non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) was not of prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Total white count was below 1,000/cu mm in 39% of cycles, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> occurred in 17% of cycles </plain></SENT>
