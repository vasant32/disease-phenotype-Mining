<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The product of mutated p53 gene is a protein with abnormal conformation, impaired DNA binding, and a prolonged half life, the latter of which results in immunohistochemically detectable levels within nuclei of malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed at the immunohistochemical determination of p53 overexpression in patients with various histological types of nonHodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL), with a particular interest in gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these patients, as well as in controls, also serological determinations of p53 protein were performed using an ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical overexpression of p53 protein was found in 21% of NHL patients, with the highest incidence of p53 immunoreactivity in cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicle center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade III, and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> the overall incidence of p53 immunoreactivity was as high as 46% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serological ELISA determinations of p53 protein in NHL patients and in controls remained below the lowest detection limit of the method in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 128 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considering that p53 mutations are associated with poor response to therapy, and consequently with poor prognosis, it is of great importance to determine the subset of patients that are particularly at risk for an unfavorable outcome and should be treated more aggressively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical determinations of p53 overexpression represent a rapid and simple, yet somewhat imperfect technique for an estimation of the frequency of mutational events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, serological determinations of p53 protein are completely inadequate for the evaluation of p53 status </plain></SENT>
