<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the mechanism of inhibition of human B-cell growth by anti-hPRL was explored with an Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA)-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (sfRamos) that proliferates continuously in serum-free medium with human transferrin as the only protein supplement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data show that antiserum immunoglobulin fraction G (IgG) to pituitary hPRL, but not nonimmune serum IgG, completely inhibited the growth of sfRamos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, anti-hPRL IgG identified a single band (29 kDa) in sfRamos spent medium, but not in fresh serum-free medium or in human transferrin, as demonstrated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>-reducing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">Polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and Western analysis of a mixture containing sfRamos spent medium and excess pituitary hPRL established that the sfRamos 29-kDa PRL-like protein (PLP29) and pituitary hPRL (23 kDa) were electrophoretically distinct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, sfRamos spent medium, but not fresh serum-free medium, was mitogenic for sfRamos and Nb2, a PRL-sensitive node rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that PLP29 is biologically and immunologically like pituitary hPRL, but is electrophoretically different from this hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that PLP29 is secreted as an autocrine growth factor by sfRamos Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells during continuous serum-free growth </plain></SENT>
