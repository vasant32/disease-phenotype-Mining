<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> are cleared rapidly by phagocytes, thus preventing tissue damage caused by loss of plasma membrane integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that the surface of leukocytes is altered during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> such that the first Ig-like domain of ICAM-3 (CD50) can participate in the recognition and phagocytosis of the apoptotic cells by macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Macrophage recognition of apoptotic cell-associated ICAM-3 was demonstrated both on leukocytes and, following transfection of exogenous ICAM-3, on nonleukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The change in ICAM-3 was a consistent consequence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> triggered by various stimuli, suggesting that it occurs as part of a final common pathway of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alteration of ICAM-3 on apoptotic cells permitting recognition by macrophages resulted in a switch in ICAM-3-binding preference from the prototypic ICAM-3 counterreceptor, LFA-1, to an alternative macrophage receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using mAbs to block macrophage/apoptotic cell interactions, we were unable to obtain evidence that either the alternative ICAM-3 counterreceptor alpha d beta 2 or the apoptotic cell receptor alpha v beta 3 was involved in the recognition of ICAM-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, mAb blockade of macrophage CD14 inhibited ICAM-3-dependent recognition of apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show that ICAM-3 can function as a phagocytic marker of apoptotic leukocytes on which it acquires altered macrophage receptor-binding activity </plain></SENT>
