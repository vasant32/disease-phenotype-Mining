<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence and colorimetric in situ hybridization methods facilitate identification of numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the development of robust, unique-sequence in situ hybridization probes that have several novel features: 1) they are constructed from multimegabase contigs of yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones; 2) they are in the form of adapter-ligated, short-fragment, DNA libraries that may be amplified by polymerase chain reaction; and 3) they have had repetitive sequences (eg, Alu and LINE elements) quantitatively removed by subtractive hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These subtracted probes are labeled conveniently, and the fluorescence or colorimetric detection signals are extremely bright </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, they constitute a stable resource that may be amplified through at least four rounds of polymerase chain reaction without diminishing signal intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate applications of subtracted probes for the MYC and EWS oncogene regions, including 1) characterization of a novel EWS-region translocation in Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, 2) identification of chromosomal translocations in paraffin sections, and 3) identification of chromosomal translocations by conventional bright-field microscopy </plain></SENT>
