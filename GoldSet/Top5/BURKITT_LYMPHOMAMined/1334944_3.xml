<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients infected with the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus are at increased risk for developing intermediate-grade and high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that in many instances contain Epstein-Barr <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> (EBV) DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because interleukin-5 (IL-5), a potent stimulator of eosinophil growth and differentiation, has been detected recently in EBV-infected B-cells, we hypothesized that some acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with EBV DNA also might contain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and IL-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After reviewing files entered into our archives during the past 3 years, we identified four cases of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus-associated, high-grade, B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that also contained extensive infiltration by eosinophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cryopreserved DNA from two of these four cases was available for amplification by the polymerase chain reaction, and both cases yielded an easily identifiable, EBV-specific amplification product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From one of these cases we also were able to extract <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and perform messenger amplification phenotyping (MAPPING) for the detection of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> coding for IL-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After reverse transcription of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from this case to cDNA and amplification by the polymerase chain reaction, we identified an amplification product that co-migrated with IL-5-positive controls in an <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> may be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and transcriptional activation of the IL-5 gene </plain></SENT>
