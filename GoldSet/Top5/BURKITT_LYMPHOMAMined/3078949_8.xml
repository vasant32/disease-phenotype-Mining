<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines with variant translocations, which are characterized by mutations in and around the first c-myc exon, DMSO is not capable of inducing the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> elongation block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The action of DMSO is, however, not restricted to regulation at the level of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> elongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the cell line BL2 with a t(8;22) translocation c-myc steady-state <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> decreased about 20 fold 1 and 2 h after DMSO treatment, followed by an increase to approximately initial levels after 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the time course of the experiment the usage of the dual promoter P1/P2 shifted from the ratio 3:1 in untreated cells to the ratio of 1:5 in BL2 cells treated with DMSO for 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This promoter shift is presumably regulated at the transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In BJAB cells an isolated intragenic transcription was detected at the boundary of intron 1 and exon 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This transcription appeared 2 to 4 h after addition of DMSO when expression of the c-myc gene was downregulated by blocking <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> elongation at the end of exon 1 </plain></SENT>
