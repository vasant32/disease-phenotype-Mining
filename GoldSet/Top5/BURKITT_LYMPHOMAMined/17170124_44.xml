<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations of CEBPA are found in a subset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and in some cases of familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, using cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and molecular cloning, we show that 5 CEBP gene family members are targeted by recurrent IGH chromosomal translocations in BCP-ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with t(8;14)(q11;q32) involved CEBPD on chromosome 8, and 9 patients with t(14;19)(q32;q13) involved CEBPA, while a further patient involved CEBPG, located 71 kb telomeric of CEBPA in chromosome band 19q13; 4 patients with inv(14)(q11q32)/t(14;14)(q11;q32) involved CEBPE and 3 patients with t(14;20)(q32;q13) involved CEBPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 16 patients the translocation breakpoints were cloned using long-distance inverse-polymerase chain reaction (LDI-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the exception of CEBPD breakpoints, which were scattered within a 43-kb region centromeric of CEBPD, translocation breakpoints were clustered immediately 5' or 3' of the involved CEBP gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Except in 1 patient with t(14;14)(q11;q32), the involved CEBP genes retained germ-line sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR showed overexpression of the translocated CEBP gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings implicate the CEBP gene family as novel oncogenes in BCP-ALL, and suggest opposing functions of CEBP dysregulation in myeloid and lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
