<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations at the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> phosphoribosyltransferase locus were studied by enumerating thioguanine-resistant cells in a clonogenic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The base-line ("spontaneous") mutation frequency was 1.52 X 10(-6), 6.38 X 10(-6), and 1.06 X 10(-6) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells from three individuals and was 1.16 X 10(-3), 6.08 X 10(-5), and 3.06 X 10(-5) for the three malignant cell lines, Jurkat (JM), HRIK, FMC-Hu1B, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutation cell/generation rate was 24.6 X 10(-8), 15 X 10(-8), and 5.5 X 10(-8) for lymphocytes from the three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, and 666.4 X 10(-8), 52.8 X 10(-8), and 131 X 10(-8) for the three malignant cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that neoplastic lymphocytes are more genetically unstable than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
