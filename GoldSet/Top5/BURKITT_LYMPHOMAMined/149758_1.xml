<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of these (DAUDI-I) produced a factor that inhibited lymphocyte proliferation in both human and mouse regardless of the stimulator, i.e. allogeneic lymphocytes or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glutaraldehyde treatment eliminated production of the factor and demonstrated that DAUDI-I was capable of stimulating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes in MLR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A second DAUDI cell line (DAUDI-S) did not produce the inhibitory factor and was capable of MLR stimulation </plain></SENT>
