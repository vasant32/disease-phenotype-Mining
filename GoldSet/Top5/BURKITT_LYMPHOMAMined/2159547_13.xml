<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rabbit antisera were raised to procaryotic fusion proteins and used to detect expression of a predicted 53-kilodalton (kDa) TP product in transfected 293 cells and latently infected lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fractionation of transfected 293 cells showed this protein to be localized to an integral membrane preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same fraction of latently infected lymphocytes contained proteins of 53 and 27 to 39 kDa as determined by Western immunoblotting with the TP-specific rabbit antisera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation of TP products from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>-labeled human lymphoblastoid cells (CR/B95-8) was used in pulse-chase experiments and showed that TP1 was a labile protein with a half-life of approximately 2 to 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anti-fusion protein serum detected a 53-kDa TP1 and degradation products in the range of 25 to 35 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A panel of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and cell lines established with virus recovered from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells were analyzed by Western immunoblotting and found to contain the 53-kDa TP1 product, its degradation products, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only two EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines (BL72 and Wewak II) were negative in this assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that a labile TP1 protein may be expressed by most, if not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, EBV-infected cell lines </plain></SENT>
