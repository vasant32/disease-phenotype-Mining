<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Induction of CCL3/4 in vitro was specific, was observed in several cell lines and freshly isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples and also took place at the protein level in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of these beta-chemokines in the mechanism of action of rituximab, we synthesized a N-terminally truncated CCL3 molecule CCL3(11-70), which had <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> activity on chemotaxis mediated by either CCL3 or BJAB supernatant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also set up an established s.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BJAB <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> model in athymic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rituximab, given weekly after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had reached 250 mm2, led to complete disappearance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> within 2-3 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of mice with cobra venom factor showed that complement was required for rituximab therapeutic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of BJAB <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> bearing mice every 2 days with the CCL3(11-70) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, starting 1 wk before rituximab treatment, had no effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> by itself, but completely inhibited the therapeutic activity of the Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To determine whether CCL3 acts through recruitment/activation of immune cells, we specifically depleted NK cells, polymorphonuclear cells, and macrophages using mAbs, clodronate treatment, or Rag2-/-cgamma-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data demonstrated that these different cell populations are involved in BJAB <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> eradication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose that rituximab rapidly activates complement and induces beta-chemokines in vivo, which in turn activate the innate immunity network required for efficient eradication of the bulky BJAB <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
