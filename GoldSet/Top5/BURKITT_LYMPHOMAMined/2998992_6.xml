<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparative studies have shown the following: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the lines were to some extent sensitive to in-vitro activated natural-killer cells, individual pairs differing as to whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> or LCL cells were more susceptible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(2) For six of the seven pairs tested, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line was clearly sensitive to allo-specific (anti-class 1 HLA) effector T cells, although levels of lysis were slightly below those observed for the corresponding LCL; only one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line showed evidence of a dramatic reduction of HLA antigen expression, and this line was insensitive to allo-specific cytolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(3) For two of the three pairs tested to date, EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell preparations from HLA antigen-matched donors lysed the LCL but not the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line, despite the latter's apparent expression of the relevant restricting antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both of these cases, it was known that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> arose in vivo in the face of prevailing EBV-specific T-cell surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An escape of the malignant cells from such surveillance may therefore be important in the overall pathogenesis of EBV genome-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
