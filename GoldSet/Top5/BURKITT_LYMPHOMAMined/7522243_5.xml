<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ability of human B lymphocytes to produce granulocyte (G)-CSF in vitro was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Highly purified tonsillar B cells were fractionated into large and small cells by a Percoll density gradient, cultured, and tested for G-CSF gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Large B cells spontaneous produced G-CSF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein, whereas small B cells did not, even after incubation with various stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypic analyses showed that large B lymphocytes contained approximately 60 to 70% of cells with the characteristic surface markers of germinal center (GC) B cells (CD38+, CD10+, and surface IgG+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining cells expressed CD39, CD23, and surface IgD and were presumably in vivo-activated follicular mantle zone B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fractionation of the large B lymphocytes into CD39+, surface IgD+, and CD39-, surface IgD- cells showed that the latter, but not the former, cell type produced G-CSF spontaneously in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of purified (CD39-, surface IgD-) GC B cells with a CD40 mAb alone or in combination with IL-4 increased G-CSF production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because these stimuli rescued a large fraction of GC cells (up to 50%) from spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in vitro, the finding may suggest that prevention of apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> resulted in an increased G-CSF production or that CD40 mab and/or IL-4 increased G-CSF gene expression in G-CSF-producing GC B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Malignant B cells purified from the invaded lymph nodes of three patients with follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and three Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, which had an immunophenotype identical with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GC B cells, spontaneously produced G-CSF in vitro, thus confirming the GC origin of the cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incubation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> purified GC B cells with rG-CSF resulted in the rescue of GC B cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, suggesting that G-CSF may be used by GC B cells in an autocrine manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This autocrine loop of production and response to G-CSF by GC B cells may be activated by stimuli such as those delivered via the surface CD40 molecule, that participate in the rescue of GC B cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
