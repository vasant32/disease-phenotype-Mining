<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This adhesiveness is mediated by specific cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (CAMs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are two molecular pathways of leucocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>--the binding of CD11a-c/CD18 (Leu-CAM family) on leucocytes to CD54 (ICAM-1) on mononuclear leucocytes, fibroblasts, and epithelial and vascular endothelial cells, or of CD2 on T cells to CD58, a cell surface molecule found on a broad range of tissue cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> process is essential for leucocyte-mediated cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and induction of lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It also participates in homing of lymphocytes into lymphoid organs and leucocyte migration from the vascular compartment to extravascular tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leucocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> is thus a critical step in the development of immune and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An inherited deficiency of the Leu-CAM family leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002718'>recurrent bacterial infections</z:hpo>, which can be fatal in early life, and lack of CAMs on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells may enable these cells to escape immunesurveillance </plain></SENT>
