<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although Zp can be activated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> in an EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Ramos), its activity is considerably lower than in EBV-positive cell lines which can be induced with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the protein product of the BZLF1 gene (ZEBRA) can transactivate its own promoter by a mechanism which involves direct binding to a region distinct from the ZI and ZII element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we show that this region is composed of two distinct ZEBRA-binding-transactivation domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these two domains are not homologous, and while one domain (ZIIIA) is similar to previously described ZEBRA-binding domains, the second (ZIIIB) is a higher-affinity site which bears no detectable homology to the consensus ZEBRA recognition sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also show that transactivation is independent of the otherwise essential ZII domain, suggesting that ZEBRA binding may functionally replace or supercede the need for a functional ZII domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This observation supports a model for activation of the lytic cycle whereby synthesis of a critical level of ZEBRA signals commitment to BZLF1 transcription and initiation of the lytic cascade </plain></SENT>
