<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement and mutation of the c-myc locus is a characteristic feature of human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether deregulation is solely a result of mutation of c-myc or whether it is influenced by the transformed B cell context has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A translocated and mutated allele of c-myc was stably transfected into fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rearranged allele was expressed indistinguishably from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc gene: it had serum-regulated expression, was transcribed with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> promoter preference, and was strongly attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus mutations by themselves are insufficient to deregulate c-myc transcription </plain></SENT>
