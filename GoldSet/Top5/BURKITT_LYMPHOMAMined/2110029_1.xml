<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint on chromosome 15 is identical to the breakpoint in the MPC-associated typical (12;15) and kappa variant (6;15) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore it probably involves the c-myc gene as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) system, a lambda/myc variant translocation has not been described in the MPC system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 16 is known to carry the lambda gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the 15;16 translocation probably represents the "missing" lambda/myc variant in MPC, suggesting that the lambda gene is localized at 16B1 </plain></SENT>
