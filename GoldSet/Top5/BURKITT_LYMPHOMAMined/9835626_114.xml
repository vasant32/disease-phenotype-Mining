<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cellular pathways for induction of programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (PCD) have been identified, but little is known about specific extracellular matrix processes that may affect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> along those pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, a series of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines were assayed for their expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that TIMP-1-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines show resistance to cold-shock-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, recombinant TIMP-1, but not TIMP-2 or a synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitor (BB-94), confers resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by both CD95-dependent and -independent (cold shock, serum deprivation, and gamma-radiation) pathways in TIMP-1-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TIMP-1 suppression of PCD is not due to metalloproteinase inhibition, as reduction and alkylation of the TIMP-1 did not abolish this activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Retroviral induction of TIMP-1 not only resulted in cell survival but also in continued DNA synthesis for up to 5 d in the absence of serum, while controls underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is reversed by anti-TIMP-1 antibodies, demonstrating that secreted TIMP-1 is active in blocking <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, TIMP-1 upregulation induced expression of Bcl-XL but not Bcl-2 as well as decreased NF-kappaB activity as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that TIMP-1 suppresses <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in B cells and suggests a novel activity for TIMP-1 in tissue homeostasis </plain></SENT>
