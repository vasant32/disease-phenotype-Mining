<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D1 is constantly overexpressed in human mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the status of c-myc gene in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have examined the c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and genomic alterations, including mutational analysis of exon 1, intron 1, and exon 2 regulatory elements, in a series of 33 MCL, 22 typical and 11 blastoid variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, c-myc alterations were also examined in 56 nodal non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> overexpression was found in 38% (11/29) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> with a slightly higher frequency in blastoid variants (5/10, 50%) than in typical cases (6/19, 31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetic alterations were only found in one blastoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> showing a three-fold c-myc gene amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In other nodal NHL, c-myc overexpression was found in 24% (7/29) of indolent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> but in 70% (19/27) of aggressive variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>c-myc Genetic alterations detected in these cases were gene rearrangement and hypermutations in one Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and individual point mutations in intron 1 or exon 2 in 1/19 (5%) indolent and 7/16 (44%) aggressive variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that c-myc is overexpressed in a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, but structural gene alterations are less frequent than in other nodal NHL </plain></SENT>
