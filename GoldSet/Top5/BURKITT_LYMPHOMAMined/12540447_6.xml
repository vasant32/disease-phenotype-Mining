<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Renal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was seen in 11 children, most commonly due to non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 10, 91%) and Burkitt's subtype (n = 5, 45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple bilateral masses were the most common CT appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Less common presentations included focal solitary masses or an engulfing mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement and other organ involvements were common associated findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of six patients with renal involvement at initial diagnosis have had cures or remissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, renal involvement at the time of initial diagnosis with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> does not portend a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
