<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nested RT-PCR and dual-color FISH techniques were used to detect <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 fusion gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 fusion transcript was found in 22.5%(9/40) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of these <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 positive patients was relatively good and the complete remission rate was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both RT-PCR and FISH techniques were proved to be useful for detecting <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 fusion gene and suitable for clinical diagnosis and prognosis evaluation </plain></SENT>
