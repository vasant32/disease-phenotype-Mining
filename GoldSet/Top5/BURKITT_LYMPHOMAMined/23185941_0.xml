<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study will also provide a source of baseline data for a further project that will include the last ten years at Tygerberg Hospita i.e. 2003 to 2012 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A retrospective study was conducted using the case records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> newly diagnosed HNL specimens from 2003 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
