<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The records of 71 pediatric patients who had B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) were studied retrospectively to document the correlation between antigenic phenotype of leukemic blasts in bone marrow (BM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence assay for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT-IF) was used to examine specimens of CSF for the presence (CSF+) or absence (CSF-) of leukemic blasts at diagnosis and at various times after the induction of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of immunophenotyping of the leukemic blasts in the BM of the CSF+ and CSF patient groups were then compared, and the relative risk ratio and positive predictive value were calculated for each marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, other possible prognostic factors, such as gender, race and ethnicity, age, and initial leukocyte count were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, including those who had cytologically confirmed cases of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, had TdT+ cells in the CSF at diagnosis or during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed between the CSF+ and CSF- groups with respect to clinical and demographic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the cases of CSF+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> had the almost exclusive expression of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin heavy chain (c mu) or surface CD22 (Leu-14), CD23 (B6), and/or IgM markers, which normally characterize the most developmentally mature members of the B-cell series in BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of any of these antigenic markers at diagnosis appears to identify at least 88% of cases of B-lineage ALL that have or ultimately may have TdT+ cells in CSE The results of this study therefore may have both basic and clinical implications: The former concerns the mechanisms by which these phenotypically defined forms of ALL invade and persist in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>; the latter concerns the utility of routine immunophenotyping of BM blasts at diagnosis to assess the biologic predisposition to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement in individual cases of ALL </plain></SENT>
