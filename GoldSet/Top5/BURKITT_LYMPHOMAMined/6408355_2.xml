<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new monoclonal antibody specific for human B cell differentiation antigen (HLB-1) is produced by a hybridoma established by fusion of splenocytes of mice immunized with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed peripheral B cell line, RPMI-8057 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This monoclonal, antibody designated anti-HLB-1 monoclonal antibody (anti-HLB-1), reacted with surface immunoglobulin (sIg)-positive B cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues and sIg-positive leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells of T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, non-T non-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) and nonlymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were HLB-1 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data were further confirmed by studying a panel of cultured human hematopoietic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-HLB-1 reacted with B cell lines derived from pre-B, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, B cell type ALL and EBV-transformed peripheral B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-HLB-1 was reactive with only one of three human <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines, and with none of the T cell, myeloid and non-T non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B ALL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This newly defined HLB-1 antigen is different from other conventional human B cell markers such as sIg, Ia antigens, and receptors for the Fc portion of Ig and complement C3 </plain></SENT>
