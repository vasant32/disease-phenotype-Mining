<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> post-transplantation <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (Burkitt-PTLD) is a rare form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334797" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">monomorphic B-cell PTLD</z:e> for which no standard treatment has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, the treatment of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> outside the post-transplantation setting involves high doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, frequent dosing, and intrathecal and/or systemic central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In PTLD, however, such protocols are associated with considerable toxicity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors present a retrospective series of 8 adult patients with Burkitt-PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients were reported to the prospective German PTLD registry or were enrolled in the PTLD-1 trial, and 2 patients had received treatment before 2000, thus allowing for comparison with the pre-rituximab era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven of the 8 patients were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age at presentation was 38 years, and the median time since transplantation was 5.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five of 8 patients had histologically established, Epstein-Barr virus-associated disease, and 7 of 7 patients were positive for a MYC translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five of 8 patients received sequential immunochemotherapy (4 courses of rituximab [R] followed by 4 cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> [CHOP] or R plus CHOP [R-CHOP]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this group, 5 of 5 patients reached complete remission (CR), and their overall survival (OS) was significantly longer (P = .008) compared with the OS for 2 of 8 patients who received first-line CHOP and did not respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One of 8 patients (who had stage IV disease with meningiosis) received combination therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> pretreatment, rituximab, intrathecal chemotherapy, whole-brain irradiation, and radioimmunotherapy) and reached CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, 6 of 8 patients reached CR; and, after a median follow-up of 4.7 years (range, 1.7-4.8 years), the median OS was 36.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no treatment-related mortality under first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the largest adult case series in Burkitt-PTLD to date, sequential immunochemotherapy with rituximab followed by standard CHOP or R-CHOP was a both safe and effective treatment </plain></SENT>
