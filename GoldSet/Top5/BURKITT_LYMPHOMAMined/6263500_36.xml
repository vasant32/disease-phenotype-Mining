<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We wished to learn whether the genomes of strains of EMB isolated from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> are consistently distinguishable from those of strains from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genome of a new transforming strains (FF41) of EBV isolated from saliva of a patient with uncomplicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> was compared with the DNA of B95-8, the only other available virus from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mononucleosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It had been found previously that B95-8 has a deletion of about 8 Md in the region of the physical map represented by the Eco RI C, Hind III D, and Bam HI I fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The W91 and HR-1 isolates for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are not deleted in this region and it had been proposed that additional information was characteristic of EBV isolates from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By means of restriction enzyme analysis, blot hybridization experiments and molecular cloning of FF41 DNA we demonstrate that the deletion found in B95-8 is not present in the new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mononucleosis</z:e> isolate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FF41 genome contains an extra 8 Md of DNA, represented by Bam HI fragments B', W' and I', which are located in a larger Eco RI C fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus the genome of this salivary isolate contains DNA that had previously been regarded to be unique to strains from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is therefore unlikely that major insertions or deletions in the EBV genome account for differences in disease manifestation following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
