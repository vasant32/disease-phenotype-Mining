<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To characterize the genomic relationship between Japanese EBV and the EBV isolates of other countries, we analyzed the LMP1 nucleotide sequences in EBV positive cell lines and clinical specimens, including five African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines, a Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line, a B-lymphoblastoid cell line, a nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> hybrid cell line, six gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues, two peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and a B95-8 cell line, which contained the prototype EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the C-terminal nucleotide sequences of LMP1 by PCR-direct sequencing analysis and characterized the sequence variation of Japanese isolates, made a phylogenetic tree from the sequence patterns of LMP1 by a neighbor-joining method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the Japanese EBV isolates are greatly different from the African <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> isolates but are closely related to the China 1, which is a strain of Chinese EBV isolates </plain></SENT>
