<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Photofrin uptake and intracellular protein binding were evaluated as a function of the incubation time using fluorescence spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The drug concentration strongly affected the intracellular distribution pattern of Photofrin, which in turn was shown to correlate with the Namalva cell response to photodynamic action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At low drug load, a gradual cell response varying from transient cell cycle arrest (predominantly S-phase) to marked photocytotoxicity modulated by incubation time and light dose was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High drug load resulted in <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> without cell cycle selectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data suggest possible Photofrin targeting of protein factors involved in cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
