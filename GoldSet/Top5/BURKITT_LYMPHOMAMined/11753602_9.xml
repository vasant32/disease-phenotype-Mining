<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BCR-ABL-positive (n = 642) and 176 BCR-ABL-negative samples underwent a second RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 518 patients, karyotyping and/or FISH was compared to the BCR-ABL status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second RT-PCR revealed in 155/642 initially positive samples a divergent result (153 BCR-ABL-negative, two other transcripts) that in most cases turned out to be caused by contaminations in the first RT-nested-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Confirmatory RT-PCR detected 2/176 false negative first RT-nested-PCR results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine specimens remained ambiguous despite different RT-PCR approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As far as cytogenetic evaluation and FISH is available (n = 23), the majority but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with an ambiguous RT-PCR result were Ph-negative (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RT-nested-PCR and cytogenetics yielded in 346 of 383 evaluable samples a concordant result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differing results are given and account in part to the lower sensitivity of karyotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, confirmed RT-PCR detected BCR-ABL fusion transcripts consistently in 487 out of 1453 ALL samples (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">c-ALL</z:e>: 43%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e>: 34%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pro-B ALL</z:e>: 5%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>: 0%, hybrid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>: 5/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since false positive initial RT-nested-PCR data were frequent, either confirmatory second RT-PCR or FISH analysis is warranted to guarantee sensitive and reliable results of utmost clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
