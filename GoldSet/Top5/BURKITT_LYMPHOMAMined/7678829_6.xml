<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Experiments were designed in an attempt to identify T- and B-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> expressed on the 17-kDa early-antigen-restricted (EA-R) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> of the EBV-induced early antigen complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using Berzofsky's algorithm, 3 hypothetical T-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on p17 were synthesized and employed in EBV-specific lymphoproliferative assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBV-infected donors responded against one of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> (p17.1) irrespective of their serological status relative to antibodies to EA-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subpopulations from seropositive donors proliferated in the presence of p17.1 in short-term cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These experiments therefore identified one T-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> on the 17-kDa <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, sera from anti-Ea antibody-positive individuals reacted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> to varying degrees, with p17.1 being the most frequently reactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the sera were grouped according to diagnosis, it was noted that 82% of the sera from patients with aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, whether Africans with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or North Americans with intermediate-grade large-cell or high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, contained antibody reactive with p17.1, while 64% were reactive with p17.2 and 29% with p17.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, high anti-EA antibody-positive sera from nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients were relatively less reactive with these synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (23% positive with p17.1; 19% with p17.2; and 13% with p17.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results therefore identified 3 B-cell EA-R <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> which might be potentially useful for clinical or epidemiological studies of EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
