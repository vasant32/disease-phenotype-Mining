<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both samples from the L3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients had the characteristic t(8;14) translocation, while the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimen presented no abnormality of chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only one of the leukemic DNA's presented a rearranged c-myc pattern, with the breakpoint region located between the first and the second exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The c-myc pattern of the two other patients appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The finding of a rearranged c-myc oncogene in fresh cells from a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> is direct evidence for the implication of c-myc in the disease whereas most of the rearrangements previously described have been found in cell lines established in culture </plain></SENT>
