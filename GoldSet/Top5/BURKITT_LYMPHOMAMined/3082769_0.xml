<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera of 131 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (78 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 53 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>) representing a wide spectrum of disease activity, treatment and presence or absence of extraintestinal manifestations were tested for circulating immune complexes using Raji cell indirect immunofluorescence assay, Raji cell radioimmunoassay, C1q solid phase assay and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> precipitation coupled with measurements of optical density and subsequent immunoelectrophoresis or radial immunodiffusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circulating immune complexes in low concentrations were observed in a small number of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, the frequency and concentrations being slightly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> than in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No association of concentrations of circulating immune complexes with disease activity or presence of extraintestinal manifestations could be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
