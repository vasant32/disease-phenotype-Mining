<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> has not yet been fully investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, using computational methods, we showed that YY1 transcript levels were significantly increased in the high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), compared with those of both low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The significant increase in gene expression resulted in a significant increase also at protein level in three NHL cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of YY1 expression with some clinical-pathological features in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> showed a positive correlation between a high level of YY1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and high levels of BCL-6 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, by analyzing the large series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> in the Hummel dataset, we identified the transcription factor PAX-5 among the top 50 genes positively correlated with YY1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings are also supported by the biological network analysis in which the top network, with the highest score, associated with YY1 expression levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> is cellular movement, hematological system development and function, and immune response. overall these data suggest that YY1 is involved in B cells transformation which gives rise to high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> through a dysregulation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development of B cells affecting cell cycle and cellular motility </plain></SENT>
