<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two murine monoclonal antibodies, designated Lym-1 and B72.3, have been successfully labeled with 99mTc in 0.1 M <z:chebi fb="3" ids="22908">borate</z:chebi> buffer at pH 9.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The choice of buffer and pH was essential for obtaining a radiolabeling yield greater than or equal to 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies demonstrated that the radiolabeled antibodies were stable and retained their immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imaging and biodistribution studies using Raji and LS174T human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice demonstrated a significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> uptake at 24-h post-injection of 99mTc-labeled MAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This improved labeling method showed better stability than those of previously published methods and resulted in significant improvement in the uptake of antibody in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>External images at 24 h post-injection revealed clearly visible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> demonstrating the benefit of this method for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> immunoscintigraphy </plain></SENT>
