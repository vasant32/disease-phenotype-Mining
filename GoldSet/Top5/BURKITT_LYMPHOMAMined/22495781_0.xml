<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite its flexibility and power, however, the test has three main shortcomings: (i) it discards important information regarding the spatial and temporal scales at which the detected interaction takes place; (ii) the results of the test have not been visualized; and (iii) recent research demonstrates the test to be susceptible to population shift bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study presents enhancements to the Jacquez k nearest neighbors test with the goal of addressing each of these three shortcomings and of improving the utility of the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases in Uganda between 1961 and 1975 are used to illustrate the modifications and enhanced visual output of the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Output from the enhanced test is compared with that provided by alternative tests of space-time interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results show the enhancements presented in this study transform the Jacquez test into a complete, descriptive, and informative metric that can be used as a stand-alone measure of global space-time interaction </plain></SENT>
