<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Here we report that B cell receptor (BCR) engagement rapidly improves the capacity of CD20 to be accessed by cognate antibody at model Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>None of eight other surface molecules demonstrated such BCR-dependent enhancement of ligand binding while the quantity of accessible CD20 remained unchanged on either CD19 or CD40 engagement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neither the actin-depolymerizing agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">cytochalasin</z:chebi> D nor inhibitors targeting signalling pathways associated with the BCR attenuated the CD20 increase that could be uncoupled from BCR endocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Instead, a role for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts was indicated both from the inhibitory actions of cholesterol-sequestering <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-beta-cyclodextrin and direct analysis of CD20 redistribution using <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> density gradients and confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whether such observations could find application in CD20-directed therapies where success can be compromised by otherwise low-level expression of target antigen is discussed </plain></SENT>
