<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed medical records and histopathologic studies of 98 children treated for NHL from 1980 to 1987 at a major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric cancer</z:e> center in Recife, Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment outcome was evaluated in relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden (stage and serum LDH) and type of therapy (LSA2L2 vs other multiagent chemotherapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a striking predominance of the small noncleaved cell (Burkitt) subtype, which occurred in 92 of the 98 children and adolescents diagnosed with NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent analyses focused on these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority (n = 84) had advanced (stage III/IV) disease at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The abdomen was the most common site of disease (84 cases); jaw involvement was rare (three cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five-year event-free survival (excluding treatment refusals) was significantly better for patients with limited vs advanced stage disease (75 +/- 14% vs 42 +/- 6%; P &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated serum LDH (&gt;500 U/l) was associated with a poorer outcome (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The type of chemotherapy did not affect EFS (P = 0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 39% of patients are long-term survivors, reflecting the high rate of septic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (25% of patients) and parental refusal/abandonment of therapy (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from eight of the 11 cases studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In clinical presentation, these cases resemble <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, yet in their apparent responsiveness to LSA2L2 therapy and association with EBV, they do not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220612" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Childhood NHL</z:e> in northeastern Brazil is predominantly of the Burkitt subtype, and is associated with clinical features that appear to distinguish it from the endemic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> forms of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
