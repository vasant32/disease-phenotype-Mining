<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of the transformation-associated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded nuclear antigens (EBNAs) 1 to 6 and membrane protein LMP-1 was studied in a series of somatic cell hybrids derived from the fusion of the EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) KR-4, and the EBV-carrying Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines Daudi, P3HR-1 and Raji, with non-B cell lines of fibroblast, erythroid, myeloid and epithelial origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of EBNAs 2 to 6 was down-regulated in the hybrids in parallel with extinction of the B cell markers CD19, CD20, CD21, CD23, HLA class II, and surface or cytoplasmic immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LMP-1 was expressed independently of EBNA-2 in hybrids derived by the fusion of the LMP-1-positive KR-4 and P3HR-1 cell lines with epithelial and myeloid cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LMP-1 was down-regulated in hybrids derived by the fusion of P3HR-1 with an erythroid cell line and in the hybrid between Raji and a mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0100244'>fibrosarcoma</z:hpo> line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBNA-1 was the only EBV antigen that was regularly expressed in the hybrids regardless of the dominating <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The autonomous expression of EBNA-1 suggests that its regulatory pathway is independent of phenotype-associated cellular or <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the expression of EBNAs 2 to 6 appears to require a B cell environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBNA-2 was shown to contribute to the regulation of LMP expression in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We show that in LCL-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> hybrids the dominating epithelial phenotype is permissive for LMP expression in the absence of EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
