<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to their origin and to a panel of phenotypic markers these lines have been classified into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> lines and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with those obtained on non-malignant EBV carrying lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the lymphoid cell lines the LCL showed a pattern of B-lymphocyte surface markers, i.e. surface immunoglobulins, C3 receptors but low density of Fc receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The non-Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines bore in varying degree these B-lymphocyte markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lines U-698 M and DG-75 were exceptional in having only surface immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-lymphocyte markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> lines differed from the lymphoid lines in lacking C3 and Fc receptors and showed only trace amounts of surface immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to lymphoid and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> lines, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> lines were completely lacking surface immunoglobulins, but showed C3 and Fc receptors in variable densities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On line, the ALL derived line MOLT-3 showed the capacity to spontaneous rosette formation with SRBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings that LCL presented a homogeneous pattern of B-lymphocyte surface markers may be of value in order to discriminate between these lines and lines derived from haematopoietic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> other than Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
