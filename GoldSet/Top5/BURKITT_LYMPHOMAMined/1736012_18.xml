<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Karyotype was available in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and nucleotide sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients showed point mutations in exons 7 or 8, including two of the nine patients with Burkitt ALL and one of the 50 patients with precursor-B-cell ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that p53 gene mutations are rare in precursor-B-cell ALL but may be more frequent in Burkitt ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the three patients with p53 mutations, however, the relevance of those mutations to the development or progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> remained uncertain </plain></SENT>
