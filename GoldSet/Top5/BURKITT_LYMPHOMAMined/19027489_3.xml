<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report five cases associated with different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> and JT to contribute to the investigation of the origin, pathogenesis, and clinical significance of JT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cases involve JT of 1q in a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>)-M1, a case of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and a case of BCR/ABL-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, as well as a JT of 13q in a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M5, and a JT of 11q segment in a case of undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, with regard to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, this study presents the first case of JT associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M1, the first case of JT involving 13q as a donor chromosome, and the first report of JT involving a segment of 11q containing two copies of the MLL gene, jumping on to two recipient chromosomes in each cell line and resulting in six copies of the MLL gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our investigation suggests that JT may not contribute to the pathogenesis but rather to the progression of the disease, and it demonstrates that chromosome band 1q10 as a breakpoint of the donor chromosome 1q is also implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, not only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> as it has been known until now </plain></SENT>
