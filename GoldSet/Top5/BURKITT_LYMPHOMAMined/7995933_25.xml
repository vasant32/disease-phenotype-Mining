<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Catabolism of class II-li complexes rapidly followed their delivery from post-Golgi compartments to dense lysosome-like compartments distinct from early and late endosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> binding assays revealed that class II molecules associated with even small N-terminal fragments of li failed to bind <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cysteine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> alone blocked li proteolysis/dissociation and accumulation of class II-li biosynthetic intermediates within lysosome-containing compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Active-site labeling of cysteine proteases in B cells was used to identify cysteine proteases capable of mediating li proteolysis within endosomal compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate rapid, possibly direct, transport of nascent class II-li complexes from the Golgi/trans-Golgi network to dense lysosomal compartments wherein cysteine protease(s), likely including cathepsin B, mediate complete removal of li </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of cysteine protease activity results in the accumulation of incompletely processed class II-li complexes, which lack <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> binding ability, within lysosomal compartments </plain></SENT>
