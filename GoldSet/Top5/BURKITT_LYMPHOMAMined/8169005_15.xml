<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Group-I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-derived cell lines, which retain in vitro the proliferative and apoptotic capacities of the parental cells, selectively entered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> when returned to 37 degrees C after a brief period at low temperature (1 degree C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by cold treatment, as determined by morphological characteristics and DNA fragmentation, was readily detectable within the first 1 to 2 hr of re-incubation at 37 degrees C, reaching a maximum at 4 to 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Commitment to enter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> occurred after as little as 20 to 30 min at 1 degree C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 1 degree C occurred only during prolonged incubation in the cold and displayed the characteristics of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both bcl-2-dependent and -independent survival pathways were found to provide protection from cold-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but only if engaged before cold-shock treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that continued cycling of group-I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells is dependent upon their capacity to inhibit or circumvent their normally constitutively active apoptotic programme, and are consistent with the notion that the synthesis of one or more critical "survival" proteins of short half-life is necessary to guarantee successful passage through the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, high levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were also inducible in group-I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells by inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
