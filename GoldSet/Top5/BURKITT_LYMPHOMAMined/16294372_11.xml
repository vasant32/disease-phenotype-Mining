<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</z:e> (SS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) occur much more frequently in women than in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is much evidence that <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> is the major cause of this gender difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> relieves the symptoms of RA and SS but it exacerbates SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This contradictory effect of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the effects of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> are mediated by two receptors: <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> receptor alpha and beta (ERalpha and ERbeta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine whether these contradictory effects of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> relate to the involvement of distinct effects of the two ERs, we investigated expression of ERalpha and ERbeta in human secondary lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed that, in tonsils, ERbeta is expressed in lymphocytes of germinal centres (GC) and the follicular mantle zone as well as in granulocytes, while ERalpha is expressed only in activated germinal centres but not in the follicular zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ERbeta is the predominant ER in human leucocytes from peripheral blood, spleen and in leucocytes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">infiltrating cancers</z:e> in both males and females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, in different human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines including Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, ERbeta is abundant while ERalpha is not detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that ERbeta is the predominant type of ER in mature lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that ERalpha and ERbeta have distinct roles in secondary lymphoid tissues and that further studies with ERbeta-specific <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> will help to elucidate the role of ERbeta in these tissues </plain></SENT>
