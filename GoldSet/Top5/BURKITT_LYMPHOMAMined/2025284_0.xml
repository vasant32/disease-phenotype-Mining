<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear how crosslinks or other cellular damage result in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies of drug effects at the level of expression of specific gene products may help elucidate the mechanism of cell killing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined proteins synthesized in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17295,29997">L-phenylalanine</z:chebi> mustard treated human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells by [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]methionine labeling and <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Drug-treated cells showed decreased labeling of proteins in two molecular weight bands of 17 kDa (a doublet) and 12 kDa at 6, 18 and 24 hours after drug removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the components of the 17 kDa doublet has been identified as calmodulin, a calcium binding protein essential to cell cycle progression and survival </plain></SENT>
