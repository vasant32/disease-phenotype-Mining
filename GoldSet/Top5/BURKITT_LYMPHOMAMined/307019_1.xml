<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An antiserum was produced by immunization of rabbits with membrane preparations of a human lymphoblastoid B cell line, Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After absorption with a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0012114'>endometrial carcinoma</z:hpo> cell line, this antiserum appeared to be specific for antigen(s) present on adult and fetal thymocytes as well as on tonsillar lymphocytes but absent, or present in very small amounts, on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or phytohemagglutinin- (PHA) stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When T and B cell-enriched fractions from tonsillar lymphocytes were tested with the anti-Daudi serum, the reactivity was equally distributed in each population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 13 human lymphoblastoid cell lines tested, reactivity was demonstrated on three out of four T cell lines, and on four out of nine B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positive reacting B cell lines were derived from two African and two American Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The antigen(s) described does not seem to be related either to human Ia-type antigens or to Epstein-Barr virus-associated antigens because these antigens are not present on fetal or adult thymocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reciprocal absorption experiments indicate that this anti-Daudi serum detects the same antigenic structures present on certain subpopulations of T and B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
