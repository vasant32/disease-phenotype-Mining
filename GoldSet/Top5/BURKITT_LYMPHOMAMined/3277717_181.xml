<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The c-myc gene comprises three exons with a single large AUG-initiated open reading frame extending from exon 2 through exon 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exon 1 lacks any AUG codons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells from a wide range of species produce two c-myc proteins that, while highly related, do not appear to arise from posttranslational interconversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To understand the origin of the two proteins, we mapped them and analyzed the in vitro protein-coding capacity of c-myc cDNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that the two proteins are derived from alternative translational initiations at the exon 2 AUG and at a non-AUG codon near the 3' end of exon 1, resulting in the production of proteins with distinct N termini </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the removal or specific mutation of exon 1 in c-myc translocations correlates with suppression of synthesis of the larger protein, and thus may contribute to the oncogenic activation of c-myc </plain></SENT>
