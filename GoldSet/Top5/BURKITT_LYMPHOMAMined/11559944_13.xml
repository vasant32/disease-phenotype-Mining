<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the usefulness of flow cytometric detection of intracellular antigens (Ags) in establishing proper lineage affiliation and its contribution to the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, we studied 100 consecutive patients in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> was diagnosed between January 1997 and July 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunological classification was assessed using a three-line panel of monoclonal antibodies for phenotypic characterization of leukemic blast cells as proposed at the First Latin American Consensus Conference for Flow Cytometric Immunophenotyping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found 74 cases of B-cell lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), seven cases of T-cell ALL, and 19 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study cytoplasmic (cy) CD79a, cyCD22, cyCD3, and cyMPO were highly sensitive, specific B, T, and myeloid markers that were expressed in virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of B and T cell ALL and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Applied in combination with immunophenotyping this knowledge led to improvement in diagnostic precision and refinement of immunological classification, ensuring the selection of the most appropriate therapy for the patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, intracellular Ags detection was of utmost importance in establishing correct lineage affiliation in cases lacking expression of B, T, or myeloid surface Ags or disclosing equivocal or ambiguous immunophenotypic features and in identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0005531'>biphenotypic acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In combination with FAB <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotyping, we were able to reliably classify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in this study </plain></SENT>
