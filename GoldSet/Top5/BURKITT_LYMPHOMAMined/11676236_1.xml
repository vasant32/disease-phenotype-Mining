<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY AIM: Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are rarely revealed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study aim was to report eight cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1988 and 1999, eight children, seven boys and one girl (mean age: 6 years) were hospitalized for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> abdominal syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abdominal ultrasonography showed intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> (n = 8) primitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (n = 2), mesentivic lymph nodes (n = 2) and liver nodes (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enema (n = 6) confirmed presence and irreductibility of the intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A laparotomy was performed on emergency in seven patients and found the primitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The procedure consisted in disinvagination (n = 4) and intestinal resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient was not operated on and the diagnosis was performed through ultrasonography guided tumoral puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the Murphy classification, there were 2 stage II, 3 stage III and 3 stage IV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With LMB protocol chemotherapy, a complete remission was observed following the first cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the children were alive at the time of this study with a follow-up longer than one year after the complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Abdominal sonography is the most efficient examination for the diagnosis of intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> and sometimes of the primitive lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the absence of sonographic intestinal impair, thanks to ultrasonography guided tumoral puncture, diagnosis may be made and chemotherapy started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is not visualized with ultrasonography, an emergency laparotomy is necessary for the diagnosis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the intestinal resection in case of necessity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is very sensible to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
