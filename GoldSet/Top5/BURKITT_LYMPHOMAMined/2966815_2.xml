<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the ability of these heterodimers to direct a CD2 + CD3 + CD8 + CD4 - CD25 + transferrin receptor + MHC-restricted human cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone to lyse a CALLA + human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only heterodimers containing an anti-CD3 antibody or activating antibodies to CD2 could direct the clone to lyse these human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> targets, even when the clone was additionally activated with anti-CD3 or anti-CD2 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our findings may have implications in the design of strategies for the use of such reagents in the treatment of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
