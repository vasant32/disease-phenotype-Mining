<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a combinatorial approach to the preparation of ligand-targeted liposomes has been developed, termed the post-insertion technique, which will facilitate the production of targeted liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, Stealth immunoliposomes (SIL) coupled to anti-CD19 made by either a conventional coupling technique (SIL[anti-CD19]), or by the post-insertion technique (PIL[anti-CD19], were compared with respect to their in vitro binding and cytotoxicity and their ability to improve in vivo survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The in vitro binding and uptake of PIL[anti-CD19] by CD19-expressing, B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Namalwa) cells was similar to that of SIL[anti-CD19] and both were significantly higher than binding of non-targeted liposomes (SL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, no significant differences were found between the respective in vitro cytotoxicities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-loaded PIL[anti-CD19] or SIL[anti-CD19], or in their in vivo therapeutic efficacy in a murine model of human B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, the results demonstrate that the post-insertion technique is a simple, flexible and effective means for preparing targeted liposomal drugs for clinical applications </plain></SENT>
