<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>MOTIVATION: New biological systems technologies give scientists the ability to measure thousands of bio-molecules including genes, proteins, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We use domain knowledge, e.g. the Gene Ontology, to guide analysis of such data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By focusing on domain-aggregated results at, say the molecular function level, increased interpretability is available to biological scientists beyond what is possible if results are presented at the gene level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We use a 'top-down' approach to perform domain aggregation by first combining gene expressions before testing for differentially expressed patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to the more standard 'bottom-up' approach, where genes are first tested individually then aggregated by domain knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The benefits are greater sensitivity for detecting signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our method, domain-enhanced analysis (DEA) is assessed and compared to other methods using simulation studies and analysis of two publicly available <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> data sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AVAILABILITY: Our DEA method uses functions available in R (http://www.r-project.org/) and SAS (http://www.sas.com/) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two experimental data sets used in our analysis are available in R as Bioconductor packages, 'ALL' and 'golubEsets' (http://www.bioconductor.org/) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online </plain></SENT>
