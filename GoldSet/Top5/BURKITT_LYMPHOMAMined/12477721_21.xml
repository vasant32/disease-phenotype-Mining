<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the protection mechanism has remained enigmatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that, upon apoptotic stimulation, newly synthesized Bcl-2 redistributes to mitochondria, interacts there with activated Ras, and blocks Ras-mediated apoptotic signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also show, by employing bcl-2 mutants, that the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="30157">BH4</z:chebi> domain of Bcl-2 binds to Ras and regulates its anti-apoptotic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiments with a C-terminal-truncated Ras or a farnesyltransferase inhibitor demonstrate that the CAAX motif of Ras is essential for apoptotic signaling and Bcl-2 association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate a potential mechanism by which Bcl-2 protects cells against Ras-mediated apoptotic signaling </plain></SENT>
