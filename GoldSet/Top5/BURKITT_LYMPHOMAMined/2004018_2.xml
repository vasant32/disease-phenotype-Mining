<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Genomic alterations of the human c-MYC gene were analysed in five human <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines established in Kawasaki Medical School and compared with those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes, Raji cells from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and an Epstein-Barr virus positive lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although no structural chromosome aberrations at 8q24, the c-MYC locus, were distinct, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of c-MYC in these <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines was 30-50-fold that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regarding the methylation of c-MYC, DNAs of the <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines were digested with MspI plus EcoRI or HpaII plus EcoRI, and hybridized with three genomic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>-labelled probes; the first, second and third exons of the human c-MYC gene, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of methylation in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> at a single CCGG site in the third exon substantially decreased in these <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines as compared with that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tonsillar B, LCL and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in hypomethylation between these <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B, LCL and Raji cells was detected in the first and second exon of c-MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the hypomethylation in the third exon of c-MYC might be related to the enhanced expression of c-MYC in these human <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
