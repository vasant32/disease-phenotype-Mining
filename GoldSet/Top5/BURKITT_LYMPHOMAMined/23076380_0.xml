<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference using short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (shRNA)-mediated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference was introduced into Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji cells to validate its effects on Bcl-2 expression and cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We constructed two types of Bcl-2 shRNA plasmid (pGenesil-1-Bcl-2-1 and pGenesil-1-Bcl-2-2) and negative control shRNA plasmid (pGenesil-1-NC) and stably transfected them into Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein were assayed by RT-PCR, flow cytometry and western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was determined by cell count assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The antitumor activities and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of the two types of Bcl-2 shRNA plasmid were evaluated in BALB/c <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice bearing Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> inoculated with Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the expression levels of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein decreased, compared with either the pGenecil-1-NC or the untransfected cell group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cell proliferation assay showed that Bcl-2 shRNA significantly inhibited the growth of Raji cells (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> of the Bcl-2 shRNA cell group was dramatically lower and smaller than that of the negative control or untransfected cell group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 protein expression in the untransfected and the pGenesil-1-NC group were markedly higher than that of the pGenesil-1-Bcl-2-1 and the pGenesil-1-Bcl-2 group by immunohistochemistry (both P&lt;0.01) and the results using transmission electron microscopy showed that Bcl-2 shRNA significantly induced Raji cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the inhibition effect of pGenesil-1-Bcl-2-1 was better than that of pGenesil-1-Bcl-2-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that vector-based Bcl-2 shRNA could effectively reduce the expression of Bcl-2 and induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and growth inhibition of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vector-based Bcl-2 shRNA could be a potential gene therapeutic strategy against human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
