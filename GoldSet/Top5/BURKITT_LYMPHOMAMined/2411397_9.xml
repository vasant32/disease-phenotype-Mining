<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The accumulation, metabolism, and retention of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50667">mercaptopurine</z:chebi> (MP) was studied in four human neoplastic cell lines (three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> lines Molt-4, CCRF-CEM, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60; and one Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line, Wilson), each of which was sensitive to MP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two cell lines resistant to MP (WilsonR and CCRF-CEMR) were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cell lines were incubated for 3 h in 10 microM [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]MP and then placed in drug-free media for an additional 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell samples were obtained at regular intervals, and the intracellular MP metabolites were measured in the acid-soluble fractions by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi>-exchange high-pressure liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MP accumulated progressively within cells during the 3-h drug exposure period and declined rapidly when the cells were placed in drug-free media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over 80% of the intracellular MP was present in the form of three nucleotide metabolites, MP <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35159">ribose monophosphate</z:chebi>, thioxanthosine monophosphate, and thioguanosine monophosphate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MP <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35159">ribose monophosphate</z:chebi> was found in greatest amount, accounting for 59-85% of the intracellular metabolite pool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thioxanthosine monophosphate thioguanosine monophosphate were detected in lesser amounts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Study of leukemic cells obtained from patients demonstrated a similar pattern of MP accumulation, metabolism, and retention, although the overall amounts of the various metabolites formed were less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was essentially no MP nucleotide metabolite formation in the two MP-resistant cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A more complete understanding of the cellular pharmacokinetics of MP in human neoplastic cells is likely to lead to a more rational use of the drug in the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
