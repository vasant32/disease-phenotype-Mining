<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A comparative study of the cellular transport of CAP and its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi> derivative (NO-CAP) was carried out in Raji cells, a transformed human lymphoblastoid cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both agents were concentrated by the cells by a factor of 3 (cellular/extracellular concentration ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cellular uptake of NO-CAP, like that of CAP, was found to be rapid and temperature-independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus the greater cytotoxicity of NO-CAP is apparently not due to an enhanced uptake of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi> derivative relative to CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the similarity of uptake, NO-CAP becomes covalently bound to both Raji cells and freshly isolated human bone marrow cells to a much higher extent (15-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, cells previously loaded with CAP or NO-CAP retain three times as much of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35800">nitroso compound</z:chebi> during a 24 hr dialysis against a drug-free isotonic solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased binding of NO-CAP to human hematopoietic cells attests to the greater reactivity of the p-substituted aromatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso group</z:chebi> and is consistent with the postulate that reduction products of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29785">nitro group</z:chebi> of CAP may be responsible for CAP-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
