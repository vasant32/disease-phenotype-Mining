<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The autologous HCT cohort had a higher proportion of chemotherapy-sensitive disease, peripheral blood grafts, and HCT in first complete remission (CR1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of autologous HCT has declined over time, with only 19% done after 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at 5 years for the autologous cohort was 83% for those in CR1 and 31% for those not in CR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corresponding progression-free survival (PFS) was 78% and 27%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After allogeneic HCT, overall survival at 5 years was 53% and 20% for the CR1 and non-CR1 cohorts, whereas PFS was 50% and 19%, respectively </plain></SENT>
