<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common site was intraabdominal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologic confirmation was present in 14/17 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>General microscopic features on smears included high cellularity and an individual cell pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extracellular lymphoglandular bodies were abundant and tingible body macrophages were prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nuclei were intermediate in size and round with a finely dispersed chromatin pattern on May-Gr√ºnwald-Giemsa stained smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasm was basophilic and scant with prominent vacuoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extracellular vacuoles and vacuoles within lymphoglandular bodies occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry performed on 16/17 cases demonstrated a B <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> in 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine cases were kappa light chain positive and six were lambda light chain positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry performed in five cases demonstrated diploid cells with a high S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can be diagnosed using combined FNAB and immunophenotyping </plain></SENT>
