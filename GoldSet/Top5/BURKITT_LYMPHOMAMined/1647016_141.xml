<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A distinct LMP-specific membrane and cytoplasmic staining was detected exclusively in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells in 18 patients (38%); EBV nuclear antigen 2 and gp350/250 immunoreactivity was absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two of 47 (68%) cases contained EBV-specific DNA sequences as detected by PCR, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> LMP-positive cases being in this category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm previous studies establishing the presence of EBV genomes in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells by demonstrating expression of an EBV-encoded protein in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The finding of LMP expression in the absence of EBV nuclear antigen 2 suggests a pattern of EBV gene expression different from that of B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, whereas this finding shows similarities with that seen in undifferentiated nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because the LMP gene has transforming potential, our findings support the concept of a pathoetiological role of EBV in many cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
