<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> from different geographical areas may exhibit pediatric, adult, and elderly age incidence peaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated this hypothesis using data on 3,403 cases obtained from the International Agency for Research on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (1963-2002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from Africa were sparse or incomplete, and thus were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-standardized rates (ASRs) and age-specific incidence rates were calculated, supplemented with the calculations performed using age-period-cohort (APC) models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ASR rose 5.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.0-5.6) per year in males and 4.6% (95% CI, 4.5-4.8) in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ASR increased gradually in children, steeply in adults and most rapidly in the elderly both in males and in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> male/female ASR ratio was 2.5, but it declined from 3.1 (95% CI, 3.0-3.3) for pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> to 2.3 (95% CI, 2.2-2.4) for adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.4-1.6) for elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age-specific incidence peaks occurred near 10 and 70 years in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions and periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A peak near 40 years of age emerged in the mid-1990s, particularly in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Findings using APC models confirmed those based on the standard analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings, based on the international <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases, support our hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> is multimodal and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> peaks at different ages may be clues to differences in the etiology and/or biology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> at those ages </plain></SENT>
