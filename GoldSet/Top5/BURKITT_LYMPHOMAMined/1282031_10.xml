<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> might contribute to this reduced susceptibility: (i) low expression of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, (ii) low expression of HLA class I and selective down-regulation of particular alleles, and (iii) down-regulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transformation-associated EBV antigens except EBV-encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA)-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study assesses the individual importance of each of these features for immune escape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose the WW1-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line was used which expresses <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the known transformation-associated EBV antigens (EBNA-1 to -6 and latent membrane protein-1 and -2) but which is negative for HLA A11 and for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule leukocyte function associated antigen-3 (LFA-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using recombinant vectors, these deficiencies have been sequentially corrected and the cells have been tested for sensitivity to EBV (B95.8 strain)-induced CTL preparations recognizing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>(s) of EBNA-4 in the context of HLA A11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of HLA A11 alone or in combination with LFA-3 did not sensitize WW1-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells to these effectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lysis was only achieved when HLA A11 was co-expressed with the B95.8 virus-encoded EBNA-4 protein, and in these circumstances sensitization did not require LFA-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that reconstitution of the relevant HLA-EBV <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> target complex on the cell membrane is sufficient to render <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells sensitive to virus-specific cytolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The requirement for EBNA-4 reconstitution to achieve lysis of the WW1-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>/A11 transfectant suggested that the resident WW1 virus-encoded EBNA-4 protein did not contain the relevant target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> for HLA A11-restricted recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by transferring the WW1 virus isolate into another A11-positive B cell background </plain></SENT>
