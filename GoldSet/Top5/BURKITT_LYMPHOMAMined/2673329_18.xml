<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among patients with the precursor B (common) form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL), the major variant seen was the group of 15 cases with expression of myeloid surface antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>4.5% of ALL cases tested with antibody to CD-11b were positive, 5.1% were CD-13+, and 10.8% CD-33+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 15 patients achieved a complete remission with chemotherapy, with six of eight children and four of seven adults remaining disease free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A smaller proportion (1.5%) of precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B ALL</z:e> patients showed expression of the T lineage marker, CD-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only significant variant seen in the precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> group was expression of HLA-DR antigen, which was found in five of 35 cases; although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> responded to treatment, only one remains a disease-free survivor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), expression of the lymphoid markers terminal transferase (TdT) and CD-7 were commonly seen (22.2% and 28.4% respectively of cases tested) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other lymphoid markers detected on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases were CD2 (11.1%), CD-10 (1%) and CD-19 (4.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that examples of lineage infidelity are regularly seen in large series of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies using uniform treatment protocols are required to establish whether these patients have significantly different disease outcomes </plain></SENT>
