<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD20 is a B-cell-specific cell surface protein expressed on mature B lymphocytes and is a target for monoclonal antibody therapy for non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Though clear clinical efficacy has been demonstrated with several anti-CD20 antibodies, the mechanisms by which the antibodies activate CD20 and kill cells remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proposed mechanisms of action include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report we compared the activity of two anti-CD20 antibodies, Anti-B1 Antibody (tositumomab) and rituximab (C2B8), in a variety of cellular assays using a panel of B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-B1 Antibody showed a low level of activity in a CDC assay against complement-sensitive B-cell lines, Ramos and Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that there is an inverse correlation between the expression of CD55 and CD59 and CDC mediated by either Anti-B1 Antibody or rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rituximab was more potent at inducing CDC when compared to Anti-B1 Antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using Raji cells as target cells and human peripheral blood leukocytes as effector cells, Anti-B1 Antibody was a potent inducer of ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The activities of Anti-B1 Antibody and rituximab were nearly identical in the ADCC assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, Anti-B1 Antibody showed direct induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In general, crosslinking Anti-B1 Antibody with a goat anti-mouse Ig did not further enhance the percentage of cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Importantly, a F(ab')(2) fragment of Anti-B1 Antibody induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, while the Fab fragment did not, indicating that the Fc region was not required and dimerization of CD20 may be sufficient for induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, rituximab, which binds to an overlapping <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> on CD20 with a three-fold lower affinity than Anti-B1 Antibody, did not efficiently induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the cell lines tested in the absence of crosslinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these two anti-CD20 antibodies have overlapping, but distinct mechanisms of action on B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
