<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gene expression in nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) includes abundant rightward transcription of the BamHI A fragment, consisting of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> ranging in size from approximately 4.0 to 8.0 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These transcripts include several distinctly spliced forms which are 3'-end coterminal and contain the BamHI A rightward frame 0 (BARF0) open reading frame (ORF) in the final exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BamHI A transcription is detected at a lower level of expression in EBV-infected lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, cDNA cloning, reverse transcription-based PCR, and Northern (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>) blotting were used to further define the structures of the BamHI A transcripts and to characterize their expression in different EBV-infected tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three BamHI A cDNAs isolated from a passaged NPC represent previously unidentified <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> that contain BARF0 and additional ORFs encoded by multiple exons, including one which extends the size of the BARF0 ORF from 174 to 279 codons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distinct exons were detected in multiple, differently sized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>, indicating that these transcripts have complex patterns of alternate splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In support of this finding, 5'-end analysis confirmed the presence of a previously reported start site and also identified a subset of transcripts of 4.8 kb and larger that initiate further 5' to this site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, 3'-end analysis identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> 3'-end processing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the BamHI A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>, resulting in transcripts that either contain the entire BARF0 ORF or are cleaved and polyadenylated 5' of the stop codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the expression of multiple, distinctly spliced BamHI A transcripts was consistently detected in a wide range of EBV-infected samples, including NPC, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and parotid <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> biopsy samples, and in type I and type III Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines and type III lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This complex pattern of start site selection, alternate splicing, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> 3'-end processing is likely to regulate the expression in vivo of the ORFs encoded by the EBV BamHI A transcripts </plain></SENT>
