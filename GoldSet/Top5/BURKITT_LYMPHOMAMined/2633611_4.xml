<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The paper summarizes our results in regard to resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and multiple drug resistance in human cell lines of pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and in children with resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cell lines as well as in children we could demonstrate amplification of the gene coding for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23743">dihydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase as a cause for resistance to MTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Procedures to overcome drug resistance such as treatment with high dose MTX and leucovorin rescue are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increased expression of the mdrl gene coding for the P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> is related to multidrug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This could be shown in cell lines and in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression decreased when the drug, used for induction of resistance, was omitted for a few weeks from the cell culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Readdition of the drug caused a rapid increase of expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the first time data in children are presented which demonstrate the amplification of the gene coding for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23743">dihydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase or increased expression of the mdrl gene as cause of drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical implications of these findings are discussed </plain></SENT>
