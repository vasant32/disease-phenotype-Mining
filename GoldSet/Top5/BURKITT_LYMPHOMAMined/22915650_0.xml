<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 56 unclustered IgH-CCND1 translocations in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> across the ~ 344-kb bcl-1 breakpoint locus demonstrates that half of the CCND1 breaks are near CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of these CpG breaks are at CGC motifs, and half of the remaining breaks are near WGCW, both known AID targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings provide the strongest evidence to date that AID initiates chromosomal breaks in translocations that occur in human bone marrow B-cell progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also identify WGCW breaks at the MYC locus in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> translocations and murine IgH-MYC translocations, both of which arise in mature germinal center B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we propose a developmental model to explain the transition from CpG breaks in early human B-cell progenitors to WGCW breaks in later stage B cells </plain></SENT>
