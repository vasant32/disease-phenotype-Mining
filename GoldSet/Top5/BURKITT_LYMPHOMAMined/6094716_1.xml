<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBNA binding protected fragments of about 30 bp of B95-8 cell-derived EBV DNA from an excess of DNase I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human anti-EBNA antibodies prevented DNA binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Purified extracts from EBNA-negative cells did not protect EBV DNA against DNase I digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mapping of the EBV DNA fragments protected from endonuclease (EcoRI, HindIII, SalI) digestion revealed many binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained following mixing of crude cell extracts and HindIII-digested fragments of EBV DNA and subsequent immunoprecipitation of the EBNA-DNA complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In experiments involving the analysis of EBV DNA, fragments were protected from DNase I digestion by purified EBNA </plain></SENT>
