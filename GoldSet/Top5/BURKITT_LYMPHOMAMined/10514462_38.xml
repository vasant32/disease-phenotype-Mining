<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using novel approaches with fluorescence probes and autofluorescence detection of endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi>, we have examined the effects of expressing Bcl-2 in the Bcl-2 negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated for the first time the effect of Bcl-2 expression on the intracellular distribution and production of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi>, under basal conditions and after treatment with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inducing agents, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> analogs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased availability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> was detected in Bcl-2-expressing cells and was correlated with an increased constitutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> production of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although production of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> was increased by either C(6)-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> or TNF-alpha in Bcl-2 negative Daudi cells commensurate with the early phases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, this increase did not occur in Bcl-2-expressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, Bcl-2 appears to allow cells to adapt to an increased state of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, fortifying the cellular anti-oxidant defenses and counteracting the radical overproduction imposed by different cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we report altered cytological features of mitochondria during the early phases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by C(6)-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> and TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, mitochondria changed in appearance, clustering in the perinuclear region and Bcl-2 expression prevented these changes from occurring </plain></SENT>
