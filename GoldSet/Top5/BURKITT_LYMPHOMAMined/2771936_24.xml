<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As others have reported, we find that DNA replication facilitates nucleosome assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show here that replication-dependent nucleosome assembly occurs in at least two steps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first step requires replicating DNA; the second step occurs after replication has been completed and is promoted by a nuclear extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this multistep model, we observe that the replicated simian virus 40 minichromosome is organized into a repeating array of DNA-protein particles that are structurally distinct from mature nucleosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These particles may be precursors in a pathway of nucleosome assembly since in the second, replication-independent step the nuclear extract converts this nascent chromatin into nucleosomes </plain></SENT>
