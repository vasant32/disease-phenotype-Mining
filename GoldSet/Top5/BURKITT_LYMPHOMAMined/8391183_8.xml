<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis after hybridization with a BamHI "V" region of EBV showed that NAB-2 cells have EBV genome integrated at a single site on the short arm of chromosome 2(p13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single hybridization signals were detected at homologous sites on both chromatoids and nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, hybridization of intact nuclei without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16397">formamide</z:chebi> denaturation and heat allowed the detection of single specific <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcripts visible as "tracks" or "traces." Southern blot analysis confirmed the integration of EBV genome into the host DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantification of slot blot hybridization revealed that NAB-2 cells have on average one copy of EBV per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Virus insertion into chromosomal DNA caused a stable modification site expressed as a distinctive achromatic region adjacent to the band 2p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The chromatid lesion at the site of EBV integration involving a recombinogenic and fragile site may have contributed to the development of the NAB-2 BL </plain></SENT>
