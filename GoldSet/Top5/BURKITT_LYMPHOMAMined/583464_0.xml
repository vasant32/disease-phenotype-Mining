<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Plastic dishes were coated with an <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The layer was modified by covalently binding proteins to it, using the CNBr-method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells were seeded on the dishes and the number of attached cells was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the attachment was demonstrated by showing that cells, carrying specific membrane-bound immunoglobulins, attached only to the corresponding anti-immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This indicated that the method could be used for cell sorting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The attachment of cells to proteins was influenced by the amount of bound protein, incubation time, temperature and the degree of trypsinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most attached cells were viable for several days and when dying they detached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Detailed morphological and cytochemical analyses of the dynamics of attachment and cytoplasmic spreading on the chemically well-defined surfaces were possible using the new method </plain></SENT>
