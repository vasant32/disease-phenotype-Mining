<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The molecular feature of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) is the translocation that places c-Myc under the control of immunoglobulin gene regulatory elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is accumulating evidence that some cases may lack an identifiable MYC translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, during the EUROFISH project, aiming at the standardization of FISH procedures in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosis, we found that five cases out of 35 classic endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> were negative for MYC translocations by using a split-signal as well as a dual-fusion probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated the expression pattern of miRNAs predicted to target c-Myc, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases, to clarify whether alternative pathogenetic mechanisms may be responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> in cases lacking the MYC translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>miRNAs are a class of small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> that are able to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several studies have reported their involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and their association with fragile sites in the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They have also been shown to control cell growth, differentiation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, suggesting that these molecules could act as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressors or oncogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated a modulation of specific miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In particular, down-regulation of hsa-let-7c was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases, compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More interestingly, hsa-mir-34b was found to be down-regulated only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases that were negative for MYC translocation, suggesting that this event might be responsible for c-Myc deregulation in such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was further confirmed by our in vitro experiments, which demonstrated that increasing doses of synthetic hsa-mir-34b were able to modulate c-Myc expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate for the first time that hsa-mir-34b may influence c-Myc expression in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as the more common aberrant control exercised by the immunoglobulin enhancer locus </plain></SENT>
