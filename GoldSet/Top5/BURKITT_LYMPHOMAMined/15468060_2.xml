<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cellular proto-oncogene c-myc is an important transcription factor that plays a role in several cellular activities such as proliferation, differentiation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It follows that regulation of c-myc expression is crucial for maintaining cell integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amplification or translocation can convert this proto-oncogene into an activated oncogene, thereby deregulating c-myc expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in the expression of c-myc leading to malignant cell growth and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> can also be triggered by extrinsic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that iron can increase cell proliferation, mainly by stimulating DNA synthesis as well as by enhancing c-myc expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied the effect of iron on cells in which c-myc expression is deregulated by either chromosomal translocation or gene amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When added to Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, iron markedly inhibits cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect is mediated by a cell cycle arrest in G2/M, followed by an important decrease in c-myc expression, whereas no effect could be observed in a cell line harboring amplified c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the down-regulation of c-myc expression, which is independent from cell cycle blockade, leads to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our results suggest the existence of a novel iron-dependent cell cycle regulatory mechanism involving modulation of translocated c-myc gene expression </plain></SENT>
