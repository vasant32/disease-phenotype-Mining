<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interaction of an active and UV-inactivated mesogenic strain (Roakin), as well as an active attenuated lentogenic strain (B1), grown in the allantoic sac of embryonated eggs, at high multiplicity, caused inhibition in cellular DNA synthesis and arrest in cell multiplication, eventually killing of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lentogenic strain cultivated in chicken fibroblasts exhibited only a moderate activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of the cytolytic effect is presumably linked to the increase in cell membrane permeability indicated by the elevation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus it appears that the massive adsorption and/or penetration of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> particles, active or UV-inactivated (or possibly a toxic component that resides in the virion), damages the plasma membrane and may be responsible for the killing of the cells </plain></SENT>
