<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported a woman with HHV-6-infected Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome was integrated into the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient's asymptomatic husband also carried HHV-6 DNA integrated at chromosome locus 1q44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the possibility of chromosomal transmission of HHV-6 DNA, we looked for HHV-6 DNA in the peripheral blood of their daughter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She had HHV-6 DNA on both chromosomes 22q13 and 1q44, identical to the site of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> integration of her mother and father, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings suggested that her <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomes were inherited chromosomally from both parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3 family members were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seropositive for HHV-6, but showed no serological signs of active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To confirm the presence of HHV-6 DNA sequences, we performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 7 distinct primer pairs that target different regions of HHV-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> sequences were consistently detected by single-step PCR in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose a novel latent form for HHV-6, in which integrated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome can be chromosomally transmitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The possible role of the chromosomally integrated HHV-6 in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e> remains to be explained </plain></SENT>
