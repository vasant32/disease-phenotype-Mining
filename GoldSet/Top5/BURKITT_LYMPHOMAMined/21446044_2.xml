<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the literature reports a low incidence of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) as a post-transplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (PTLD), this entity appears to be different from other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334798" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">monomorphic PTLDs</z:e> (M-PTLDs), both in its aggressive clinical presentation and its distinct pathologic profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, diagnosed in the post-transplant setting, (patients aged â‰¤ 18 years) were retrieved from the pathology archives at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center from 1982 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were obtained along with pathologic review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients with pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in the post-transplant setting (9 boys, 3 girls) were retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients displayed a monomorphic population of small to intermediate-sized, noncleaved, lymphoid elements with a "starry-sky" pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotype for patients available to the study was CD20+ (n = 9/10), CD10+ (n = 8/8), bcl-6+ (n = 11/11), with a near 100% Ki-67/MIB-1 proliferation index (n = 7/7), and negative for TdT (n = 7/7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most pretransplant Epstein-Barr virus titers were negative (n = 8/10), with post-transplant titers positive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested patients (n = 11), and with positive Epstein-Barr-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in situ hybridization in most cases (n = 9/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time from transplantation to diagnosis was 52 months (range, 6-107 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were currently alive after immediate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> chemotherapy, with median disease-free time of 93 months from diagnosis (range, 2-199 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-PTLD had a higher Epstein-Barr virus incidence compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and represented a distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334798" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">monomorphic PTLD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although some M-PTLDs can be managed less aggressively with decreased immunosuppression alone, immediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-specific chemotherapy was associated with a favorable outcome and was strongly recommended </plain></SENT>
