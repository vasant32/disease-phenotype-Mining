<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ubiquitous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is related to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and is also the etiological agent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (IM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sequence variations in the gene encoding LMP1 have been deeply studied in different pathologies and geographic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Controversial results propose the existence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-related variants, while others argued in favor of a geographical distribution of these variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reports assessing EBV variants in IM were performed in adult patients who displayed multiple variant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, LMP1 variants in 15 pediatric patients with IM and 20 pediatric patients with EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from Argentina were analyzed as representatives of benign and malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in children, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 3-month follow-up study of LMP1 variants in peripheral blood cells and in oral secretions of patients with IM was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an integrated linkage analysis was performed with variants of EBNA1 and the promoter region of BZLF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar sequence polymorphisms were detected in both pathological conditions, IM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but these differ from those previously described in healthy donors from Argentina and Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that certain LMP1 polymorphisms, namely, the 30-bp deletion and high copy number of the 33-bp repeats, are associated with EBV-related pathologies, either benign or malignant, instead of just being <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, this is the first study to describe the Alaskan variant in EBV-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that previously was restricted to nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> from North America </plain></SENT>
