<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper aggregates prepared by heat or alkali denaturation of human IgG were fractionated by column chromatography through LKB AcA 22 Ultrogel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heat aggregation yields preparations containing considerably more monomer than alkali treatment (47% and 6.3% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bulk of aggregated material prepared by both methods was of size 19 S or greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Smaller aggregates were present in assayable quantities only in the alkali aggregated material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sized fractions of aggregates IgG were tested in the presence of a human complement source for their efficiency in the C1q binding and Raji radioimmunoassay for immune complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both techniques efficiently measured large aggregates (greater than or equal to 19 S) but the C1q binding assay measured smaller material with greater efficiency than did the Raji cell assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither technique detected monomeric IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The date presented is relevant to the binding characteristics of the 2 assay systems studied and suggests that when used together they are capable of measuring immune complexes present over a wide range of sizes </plain></SENT>
