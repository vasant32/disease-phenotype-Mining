<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ras is an important cellular switch, relaying growth-promoting signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In cultured cells, Ras is activated by various hematopoietic cytokines and growth factors, but the activation state of Ras in peripheral WBCs and bone marrow cells has not been studied nor has Ras activation been assessed in cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using an enzyme-based method, we assessed Ras activation in peripheral WBCs, lymphocytes, and bone marrow cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and from children with T-cell ALL (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>) and B-lineage ALL (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, we found mean Ras activations of 14.3, 12.5, and 17.2% for peripheral blood WBCs, lymphocytes, and bone marrow cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three of these values are higher than we have found in other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human cells, compatible with constitutive activation of Ras by cytokines and growth factors present in serum and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 9 of 18 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>, Ras activation exceeded two SDs above the mean of the corresponding cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, whereas in none of 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> did Ras show increased activation; activating genetic mutations in ras occur in less than 10% of ALL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, Ras is relatively activated in peripheral blood WBCs, lymphocytes, and bone marrow cells compared with other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human cells, and Ras is activated frequently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased Ras activation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> may contribute to the more aggressive nature of the former disease </plain></SENT>
