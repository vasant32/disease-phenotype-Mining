<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is cumulative evidence that suggests a role for Op18 in integrating signals from diverse pathways involved in cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Op18 phosphorylation is induced with proliferation in a variety of cell types, and is essential for cell cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we analyzed the level of unphosphorylated Op18 and of its major phosphorylated forms, Op18a and Op18b, in a series of 177 childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> by means of quantitative two-dimensional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Op18 phosphorylation was significantly correlated with the white blood count at the time of diganosis, and with a high percentage of cells in the S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that strategies to inhibit Op18 expression or phosphorylation may be effective in inhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
