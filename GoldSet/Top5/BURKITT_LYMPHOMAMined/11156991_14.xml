<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The decapentaplegic (dpp) gene directs numerous developmental events in Drosophila melanogaster. dpp encodes a member of the Transforming Growth Factor-beta family of secreted signaling molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At this time, mechanisms of dpp signaling have not yet been fully described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore we conducted a genetic screen for new dpp signaling pathway components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The screen exploited a transvection-dependent dpp phenotype: heldout wings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The screen generated 30 mutations that appear to disrupt transvection at dpp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the mutations is a translocation with a recessive lethal breakpoint in cytological region 23C1-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetic analyses identified a number of mutations allelic to this breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 23C1-2 complementation group includes several mutations in the newly discovered gene lilliputian (lilli). lilli mutations that disrupt the transvection-dependent dpp phenotype are also dominant maternal enhancers of recessive embryonic lethal alleles of dpp and screw. lilli zygotic mutant embryos exhibit a partially ventralized phenotype similar to dpp embryonic lethal mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analyses revealed that lilli encodes the only Drosophila member of a family of transcription factors that includes the human genes causing Fragile-X <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> (FMR2) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (LAF4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the genetic and phylogenetic data suggest that lilli may be an activator of dpp expression in embryonic dorsal-ventral patterning and wing development </plain></SENT>
