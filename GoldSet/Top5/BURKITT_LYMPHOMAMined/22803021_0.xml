<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of primary extranodal non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract has been on the rise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of primary GI NHL and distribution according to site and histological type in a large North American adult population over a 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> diagnoses of GI NHL made between January 1999 and January 2009 were reviewed using a regional pathology database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients â‰¥18 years of age living within health region boundaries were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates of GI NHL according to GI site and histological type over a 10-year period were calculated and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 149 cases of primary GI NHL were identified during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age- and sex-adjusted yearly incidence rates ranged from 0.13 per 100,000 in 1999, to 2.39 per 100,000 in 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological distribution (47% diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 24% extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type, 8% follicular and 5% mantle cell) and site distribution (47% stomach, 26% small bowel, 17% colon) were obtained with increasing annualized incidence rates for each of these sites over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Remaining cases included multiple GI sites of involvement (9%) and esophagus (0.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Population-based GI NHL incidence rates in the present study were higher than those described elsewhere in North America and Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nearly one-half showed high-grade (diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) histology at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates for the colon exceed those described in other studies worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because the majority of GI NHL are diagnosed on endoscopic biopsy, clinicians and pathologists must be vigilant of this entity </plain></SENT>
