<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The enhancement of immunoglobulin production with this enzyme was not linked with its enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The enzyme enhanced immunoglobulin productivity of transcription-suppressed hybridomas, but did not enhance that of translation-suppressed hybridomas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From these results, it is suggested that this enzyme takes part in the post-translational control or the enhancement of translation activity to stimulate immunoglobulin production of hybridomas </plain></SENT>
