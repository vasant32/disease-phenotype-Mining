<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have isolated and sequenced cDNA clones encoding the human homolog of the mouse Lyb-2 B cell differentiation Ag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous data suggest that Lyb-2 might represent a growth factor or lymphokine receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human Lyb-2 mRNA is expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human tonsils and bone marrow cells, in the pre-B cell line REH, in three Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, and in some EBV-transformed B cell lines, but not in antibody-secreting <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines, T cell lines, or a promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that expression of human Lyb-2 is restricted to B lineage cells and turned off in antibody-secreting plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A polyclonal mouse antiserum was raised against human Lyb-2 and immunoprecipitates a Mr 42,000 protein from REH, Raji, and Daudi cells and from mouse L(tk) cells transfected with the human Lyb-2 cDNA in an expression vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The human Lyb-2 protein is related to both the asialoglycoprotein receptor and CD23, the B cell-specific FcR for IgE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that human B cells express a previously undescribed cell surface protein that is homologous to mouse Lyb-2 and has a similar pattern of expression during B cell development </plain></SENT>
