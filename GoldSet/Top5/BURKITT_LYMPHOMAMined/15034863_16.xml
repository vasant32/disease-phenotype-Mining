<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The detection of MYC breakpoints is hampered by technical problems, including the distribution of the breakpoints over a very large genomic region of approximately 1,000 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article, we report on the testing and validation of a segregation fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for MYC breakpoints on a large series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A contig of overlapping genomic clones was generated, and two probe sets flanking the MYC gene were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both probe sets were tested in an interphase FISH segregation assay on 8 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and 32 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples with proved 8q24/MYC abnormalities and validated in 47 BLs from The Netherlands, Brazil, and Uganda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MYC translocation breakpoints were identified in 98% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of the test series and in 89% of the cases of the validation series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 89% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> positive samples, the breakpoints were located between 190 kb 5' and 50 kb 3' of MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine cases had more distant breakpoints, and in one patient an insertion of MYC into the IGH region was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two of the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> lacking CD10 expression, no breakpoint could be detected, suggesting that CD10 is a discriminative marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We did not find consistent differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in incidence of an MYC breakpoint </plain></SENT>
