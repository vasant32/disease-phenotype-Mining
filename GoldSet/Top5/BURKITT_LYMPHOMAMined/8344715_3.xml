<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of Farage resembled that of EBV-LCL but differed from the phenotype of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, which were CD39- CD44-, expressed a high level of CD38, and either lacked CD21 or were weakly positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exposure to IL-4 augmented the concentrations of CD23 and of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> proteins on the surface of Farage cells but diminished the expression of CD21, CD22, and CD38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-4 did not induce the expression of sIg on Farage cells and failed to affect the level of HLA-DR </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although IL-4 induced unique changes of the antigenic pattern in Farage, no significant effect on the phenotype of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines was detected after IL-4 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that the responsiveness of B cells to IL-4 is not determined by the expression of sIg but rather is associated with the antigenic profile characteristic for non-germinal center B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
