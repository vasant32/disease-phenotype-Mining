<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presenting clinical, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic features of this subgroup were similar to those of the 89 patients without major karyotypic shifts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median length of initial remissions in these nine patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom received intensive multiagent therapy, was 24 months (range, 6 to 35); responses to subsequent treatment have been uniformly poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prominent cytogenetic changes included a gain of modal chromosome numbers in five cases, a loss of chromosomes in two, and the acquisition of an 11q23 rearrangement in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose several different mechanisms to account for these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one, the presence of an entirely different ALL karyotype at relapse may represent induction of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> analogous to the well-described entity of epipodophyllotoxin-related secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
