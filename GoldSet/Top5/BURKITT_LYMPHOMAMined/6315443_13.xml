<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an epidemiological survey in the West Nile District of Uganda, 70 pathologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases were detected over a 5-yr period; this corresponded to an annual incidence rate of 1.6 per 100,000 general population or about 5 per 100,000 children in the age group 5-14 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the confirmed cases which were examined by EBV/DNA molecular hybridization, 96% were found to contain an average of 38 EBV genome equivalents per <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell, whereas none of the examined unconfirmed cases did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Duplicate hybridization assays in two laboratories were in close agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serological testing showed that 91% of the confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases had elevated EBV/VCA titres (greater than or equal to 160) and 64% were EA(D)-positive (greater than or equal to 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the cases with high EBV/genome content had high VCA titres, but there was a poor correlation between the two parameters among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that in high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> incidence areas the association between EBV and this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is almost constant, whereas it is exceptional in low-incidence areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This further supports the aetiological implication of EBV in the endemicity of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in equatorial Africa </plain></SENT>
