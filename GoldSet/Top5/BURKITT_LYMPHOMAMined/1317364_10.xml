<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This adherence is mainly mediated by 3 families of cell-surface <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules: integrins, immunoglobulin-related molecules and selectins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since variations in the degree of adherence may affect the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, the expression of a large number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules was analysed on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), and on EBV-positive or EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) lines, by immunofluorescence flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With regard to the beta 1, beta 2 and beta 3 integrin subfamilies, LCLs strongly expressed CD49d/CD29 (VLA-4), CD11a/CD18 (Leu-CAMa, LFA-1) and CD51/CD61 (vitronectin receptor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells also abundantly expressed CD54 (ICAM-1) and CD58 (LFA-3) as well as the "homing receptors" L-selectin (LECAM-1) and CD44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines had considerably lower amounts of VLA-4 than LCLs, and ICAM-1 was expressed only by some of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lines </plain></SENT>
