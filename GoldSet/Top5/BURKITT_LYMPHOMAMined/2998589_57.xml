<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously described the derivation of a monoclonal antibody, S2C6, to a novel 50 Kdalton antigen associated with human urinary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002862'>bladder carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No reactions were obtained with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of unrelated origin or with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> urothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the antibody also reacted with a similar antigen on some cell lines of B lymphocyte origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using large panels of target cells we have now shown that this reactivity was entirely restricted to cells of the B lineage within the haematopoietic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As opposed to its apparent restriction to malignant cells of the urothelium, the S2C6 antigen was expressed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes as well as by many malignant B cells (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, hairy cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-B cells derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and plasma cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> lacked the antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression was significantly enhanced on cultured B cells from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and on Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines including those of the pre-B phenotype derived from fetal bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As judged from the molecular size and the distribution pattern displayed by the S2C6 antigen it appears to be distinct from other B cell antigens previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A possible relation of the S2C6 antigen to a receptor for B cell growth factors is discussed </plain></SENT>
