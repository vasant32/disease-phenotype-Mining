<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 6.6 or 20 microM of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, the values for the concentration of drug required for 50% inhibition of cell growth for each cell line fell into a rather narrow range, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in VCR sensitivity among cell lines was circumvented in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">Verapamil</z:chebi> also enhanced the cytotoxicity of Adriamycin, although the extent of enhancement was considerably small </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At maximum effective concentration of these reagents, a 3- to 5-fold increase in VCR cytotoxicity occurred in K562 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In VCR-resistant K562 cells, a more prominent enhancement (20- to 45-fold) was observed with these reagents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>VCR resistance was circumvented in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of enhancement of VCR cytotoxicity was explained by the enhanced accumulation of VCR in K562, especially in resistant cells </plain></SENT>
