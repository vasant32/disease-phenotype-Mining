<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified that are transcribed during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> from three clusters in the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two of the three clusters of miRNAs are made from the BamHI A rightward transcripts (BARTs), a set of alternatively spliced transcripts that are highly abundant in NPC but have not been shown to produce a detectable protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that while the BART miRNAs are located in the first four introns of the transcripts, processing of the pre-miRNAs from the primary transcript occurs prior to completion of the splicing reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, production of the BART miRNAs correlates with accumulation of a spliced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in which exon 1 is joined directly to exon 3, suggesting that this form of the transcript may favor production of miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequence variations and processing of pre-miRNAs to the mature form also may account for various differences in miRNA abundance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, residual intronic pieces that result from processing of the pre-miRNAs were detected in the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The predicted structures of these pieces suggest there is a bias or temporal pattern to the production of the individual pre-miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that multiple factors contribute to the production of the BART miRNAs and to the apparent differences in abundance between the individual miRNAs of the cluster </plain></SENT>
