<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By utilizing an EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (BJAB) and several EBV-positive sublines derived from it by in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, it was possible to show that the presence of the virus was associated with altered expression and copy number of MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the EBV-negative BJAB line, the level of MYC transcripts declined progressively as cells approached the stationary phase of growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in EBV-infected BJAB cells MYC expression remained elevated as cells entered stationary phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This effect on MYC expression was reversibly linked to the presence of the virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> of BJAB cells by two different strains of EBV, amplification of MYC in association with the appearance of a homogeneously staining region on chromosome 8 at the mapped location of MYC had occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that both the deregulation of MYC transcription and the chromosomal rearrangement in the region of the MYC locus in this B-cell line may have occurred as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
