<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the MOST-1 mRNA expression in bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, and to explore its association with immunophenotype and treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Semiquantitative RT-PCR was employed to study the MOST-1 mRNA expression in BM mononuclear cells separated by Ficoll density gradient method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MOST-1 expression levels were represented by the ratio of MOST-1 band pixels against its corresponding housekeeping gene beta-actin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> band pixels determined by GDS8000 densitometry and GelWork-1 analysis software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PCR product was eluted and sequenced, and its sequence was confirmed by Pairwise BLAST search </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 17 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MOST-1 mRNA was exclusively expressed in the mononuclear cells from 3 patients with ALL-L3 type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was no MOST-1 mRNA expression in other 14 children with ALL-L1 or ALL-L2, irrespective of their initial peripheral WBC count and blast cell percentage in peripheral blood and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MOST-1 mRNA expression levels in two of the ALL-L3 patients with higher blast cell percentages in peripheral blood and bone marrow were 3- and 2-fold respectively as compared with that in the third ALL-L3 child with lower initial blast cell load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MOST-1 mRNA expression was no longer detected in the two ALL-L3 children after complete remission with combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MOST-1 was expressed in the bone marrow mononuclear cells in patients with ALL-L3, and its expression level was somewhat related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It might be implicated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> of ALL-L3 and might serve as an indicator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden and thus a useful guide for clinical management </plain></SENT>
