<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to clarify the controversy about the distinction between Burkitt's and non-Burkitt's small noncleaved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 55 cell lines derived from 48 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients were characterized by morphometry on plastic-embedded sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of the measurements permitted the identification of five main cytologic types, with regard to nuclear size, nuclear area dispersion and irregularity of nuclear profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the geographic origin of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> seemed to play essential roles in the determination of nuclear size, with a significantly larger size seen in EBV-positive cell lines, and especially in the African lines among these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin profile and monoclonal antibody expression also correlated with the nuclear size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two conclusions may be drawn from this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An in vivo transformation of the cells of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can be postulated to explain the wide morphologic spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> presenting a rearrangement of chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fact that typical and atypical Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> cannot be differentiated by study of their derived cell lines raises the question as to the validity of the distinction between the two subtypes of small noncleaved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
