<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The new and growing family of interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE) cysteine proteases are now recognised to be major effectors of cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Like other members of this family, the CPP32/Yama proform is activated by processing to its active heterodimeric enzyme or apopain when it likely contributes to the process of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by cleaving poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP) and thereby inhibiting much of its DNA repair activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> plays a fundamental role in the regulation of the immune system where it is involved in the selection of both T and B lymphocytes bearing antigen receptor (AgR) for non-self </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells of the Ramos Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-genome-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) B cell line (Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) can be triggered into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by treating with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> ionomycin or by crosslinking their surface AgR with antibodies directed against immunoglobulin (Ig)M (anti-IgM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ionomycin- and AgR-triggered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> are arrested by signals transduced through the surface CD40 of Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both ionomycin and anti-IgM trigger activation of CPP32 and cleavage of PARP prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>; this process is abrogated by treatment with anti-CD40 and is independent of Bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47923">tripeptide</z:chebi> inhibitor of ICE family cysteine proteases, Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) inhibits ionomycin- and AgR-triggered CPP32 activation, PARP cleavage and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath>, in Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, in this report we demonstrate that in a physiological system, activation of endogenous members of the ICE family, including CPP32, and cleavage of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> substrate PARP act as major effectors of apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
