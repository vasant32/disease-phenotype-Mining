<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Development of a clonogenic assay that detects elimination of up to 5 logs of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in the presence of a 20-fold excess of human bone marrow has permitted the evaluation of two different methods for the selective removal of malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) (60 to 100 micrograms/mL) eliminated 2.0 to 3.5 logs of clonogenic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antitumor activity depended upon the concentration of 4-HC and the length of incubation, but not upon the concentration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparable removal of clonogenic Burkitt's cells was achieved by treatment with rabbit complement (C') and a combination of J5 anti-common <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> antigen (J5 anti-CALLA), J2 anti-gp 26, and the B1 anti-B1 murine monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A combination of 4-HC and monoclonal antibodies proved slightly but significantly more effective than either single agent in eliminating clonogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although treatment with 4-HC markedly reduced granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units-C (GM-CFU-C) content of human bone marrow, neither treatment with 4-HC nor treatment with monoclonal antibodies and C' eliminated precursor cells that could generate new GM-CFU-C after growth in continuous bone marrow cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that treatment with 4-HC in combination with multiple monoclonal antibody reagents could be a safe and effective method of eliminating clonogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from human bone marrow </plain></SENT>
