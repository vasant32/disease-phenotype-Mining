<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Point mutations have been described within c-MYC in several Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and it has been proposed that translocation into the Ig loci might have transformed c-MYC into a substrate for the antibody hypermutation mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we test this hypothesis by exploiting a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line (Ramos) that we have previously shown to hypermutate its immunoglobulin genes constitutively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We find that, during in vitro culture, Ramos mutates the c-MYC allele that is translocated into the IgH locus whilst leaving the untranslocated c-MYC and other control genes essentially unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutations are introduced downstream of the c-MYC transcription start with the pattern of substitutions being characteristic of the antibody hypermutation mechanism; the mutation frequency is 2-3-fold lower than for the endogenous functional IgH allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus chromosomal translocations involving the Ig loci may not only contribute to transformation by deregulating oncogene expression but could also act by potentiating subsequent oncogene hypermutation </plain></SENT>
