<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently developed a novel Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement (IgH-R) assay that combines polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and analysis in the same closed capillary tube using the LightCycler System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IgH-R can be identified by DNA melting curve analysis within 40 minutes after DNA preparation and amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the clinical utility of this new IgH-R assay for rapidly diagnosing cutaneous B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, we prospectively analyzed 44 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues suspected of B-cell malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>: skin (n = 31), lymph node (n = 7), stomach (n = 3), spleen (n = 1), colon (n = 1), and soft tissue (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We detected IgH-R in 12 DNA samples, including 8 skin biopsies, with the following diagnoses: B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 4), extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 4), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 2), Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1), and precursor B-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA melting curve analysis, compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, achieved a sensitivity equal to 92.3% and a specificity equal to 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a single false negative result because DNA melting curve analysis could not detect less than 10.0% clonal B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this new, rapid PCR assay for detecting IgH-R based on DNA melting curve analysis can be clinically useful for confirming the initial diagnosis of B-cell malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
