<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although rare cases of sIg+ precursor lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> are recognized, sIg+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> often represent leukemic phase of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or other non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> such as blastic mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study reports four adults, two women (56 and 58 years old) and two men (35 and 41 years old) with lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> that displayed lambda, surface immunoglobulin restriction (sIg+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The leukemic cells were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dim CD45 positive with side scatter light characteristic of blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two cases were positive with the blasts associated with antigens TdT and CD34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic abnormalities were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and in three cases included abnormalities commonly present in precursor lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Translocation (1;19) (q23;p13) was present in the first case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the 3' region of the mixed lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (MLL) gene at chromosome 11q23 as well as t(14;18) were detected in the second case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 3rd case, a BCR-ABL fusion gene was detected as part of a complex abnormal karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Translocation (1;19)(q23;p13) was present in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the 3' region of the mixed lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (MLL) gene at chromosome 11q23 as well as t(14;18) were detected in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BCR-ABL fusion gene was detected as part of a complex abnormal karyotype in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These cases illustrate that lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> occurring in adults exhibit a morphologic, immunophenotypic as well as a genetic spectrum and represent either non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or precursor lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A multi-parameter approach including flow cytometric and genetic studies is crucial in separating these cases </plain></SENT>
