<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under the proper conditions, this method is sufficiently sensitive to detect EBV DNA in the amount of 0.1 genome per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the samples tested that have been suspected to be without EBV DNA by cRNA hybridization proved negative by this more sensitive specific analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These included Hela and Hep2 cells, a negative case of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, two negative cases of nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and two established human leukocytic lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homology tests conducted with single-strand-specific nuclease S1 indicated that the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA from a nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> were more than 90% homologous to EBV DNA </plain></SENT>
