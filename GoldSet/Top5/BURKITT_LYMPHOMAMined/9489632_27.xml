<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 1132 patients with ALL of T lineage (n = 416) or of B lineage (cALLa+) (n = 716) transplanted in first (n = 605) or second (n = 527) remission with bone marrow from an HLA-identical sibling donor, between 1982 and 1992, and reported to the IBMTR by 165 teams </plain></SENT>
