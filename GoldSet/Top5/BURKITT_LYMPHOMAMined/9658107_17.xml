<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the BARF0 sequence includes an HLA A*0201-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using theoretically predicted HLA A2 binding motifs and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-loaded antigen presentation-deficient T2 cells, polyclonal BARF0-specific CD8(+) CTLs were isolated from four different healthy EBV-seropositive donors but not from two seronegative donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These CTL lines recognized the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> LLWAARPRL, which was found to be conserved in 33 of 34 virus strains originating from Caucasian, African, and Asian individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BARF0-specific CTL lines could lyse EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells stably transfected with the BARF0 gene but did not kill HLA A2-matched EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells and LCLs in a standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis demonstrated that these EBV-positive cell lines expressed significantly lower levels of BARF0 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> than transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This data indicated that the BARF0 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> could be endogenously processed; however, antigen levels in the target cell were a limiting factor for the effective interaction between BARF0-expressing cells and CTLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The limited expression of BARF0 antigen in EBV-infected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells and LCLs might contribute to the escape of immune recognition from virus-specific CTLs present in the host </plain></SENT>
