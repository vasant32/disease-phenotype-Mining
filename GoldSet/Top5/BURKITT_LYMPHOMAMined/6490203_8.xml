<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By these criteria, 12 lines of known malignant origin were tumorigenic, 11 lymphoblastoid lines, tested after less than one year of in vitro growth, were non-tumorigenic and 8/18 long-established lymphoblastoid lines produced transplantable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the long-established lines had acquired karyotypic changes on prolonged culture, the predominant characteristic being a gain of whole chromosomes or of major chromosome segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None showed the classical 8:14 translocation associated with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparisons with nontumorigenic precursors (recovered from liquid nitrogen storage) and with other non-tumorigenic but chromosomally abnormal, lymphoblastoid lines suggest that imbalance of the dosage of genes carried on chromosomes 7,8 and 9 may be important in determining the tumorigenic phenotype </plain></SENT>
