<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is capable of adopting three distinct forms of latency: the type III latency program, in which six EBV-encoded nuclear antigens (EBNAs) are expressed, and the type I and type II latency programs, in which only a single <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> nuclear protein, EBNA1, is produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several groups have reported heavy CpG methylation of the EBV genome in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines which maintain type I latency, and loss of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines has been correlated with a switch to type III latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, evidence that the type III latency program must be inactivated by methylation to allow EBV to enter the type I or type II restricted latency program is provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data demonstrates that the EBNA1 gene promoter, Qp, active in types I and II latency, is encompassed by a CpG island which is protected from methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CpG methylation inactivates the type III latency program and consequently allows the type I or II latency program to operate by alleviating EBNA1-mediated repression of Qp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methylation of the type III latency EBNA gene promoter, Cp, appears to be essential to prevent type III latency, since EBNA1 is expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> latently infected cells and, as shown here, is the only <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigen required for activation of Cp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBV is thus a pathogen which subverts host-cell-determined methylation to regulate distinct genetic programs </plain></SENT>
