<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is maintained as an episome in most infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of fused terminal restriction enzyme fragments distinguishes the circular DNA form from the linear virion form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EBV genomic structure was analyzed in 8 lymphoid cell lines and 21 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimens by the Southern blot technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> integration into host chromosomal DNA was identified in four cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the Namalwa and BL30-B95.8 cell lines, integration occurred through the terminal repeat (TR) sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the BL41-P3HR1 and BL41-B95.8 cell lines, there was loss of left-end <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomic sequences, including ori-P sequences required for episome maintenance, implying that integration was required for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome persistence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Integration was not detected in four other cell lines (Raji, Daudi, B95.8, and BL30-P3HR1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 21 EBV-containing human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including 18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, fused TR sequences were identified without evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomic integration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that, although <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> integration is common in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines infected in vitro, integration is not common in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that develop in vivo in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or immunodeficient people </plain></SENT>
