<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the Daudi Is studied at 90 min and up to 8 h, relative proportions of 3H-labeled nuclear <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were reproducibly altered as compared to controls: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> increased while phosphatidylserine and total neutral <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These changes were not detected in parallel studies of the whole cell extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant changes in the profiles of nuclear <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were observed in Daudi Ir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Decreased rates of alpha DNA polymerase and of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcription were evident within 90 min in the Daudi Is nuclei but not in untreated controls or nuclei from rIFN alpha A-treated Daudi Ir cells, thus suggesting a possible relationship of the rapid alterations of nuclear <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> biosynthesis in Daudi Is cells to the rIFN alpha A antiproliferative activity </plain></SENT>
